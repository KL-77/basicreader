            <h2>Comcast keeps losing customers despite price guarantee and unlimited data</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/comcast-keeps-losing-customers-despite-price-guarantee-and-unlimited-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh bemoaned that the company’s cable broadband division was “not winning in the marketplace” amid increased competition from fiber and fixed wireless Internet service providers.

Cavanagh identified some problems that had been obvious to Comcast customers for many years: Its prices aren’t transparent enough and rise too frequently, and dealing with the company is too difficult. Comcast sought to fix the problems with a five-year price guarantee, one year of free Xfinity Mobile service for home Internet customers, and plans with unlimited data instead of punitive data caps. But the company is still losing broadband customers at a higher-than-expected rate.

In Q4 2025 earnings announced today, Comcast reported a net loss of 181,000 residential and business broadband customers in the US. The loss consists of 178,000 residential Internet customers and 3,000 business customers.

The Q4 net loss is more than the 176,000 loss predicted by analysts, although not as bad as the 199,000-customer loss that spurred Cavanagh’s comment about Comcast “not winning in the marketplace” nine months ago. The Q4 2025 loss reported today is also worse than the 139,000-customer loss in Q4 2024 and the 34,000-customer loss in Q4 2023.

“Subscriber losses were 181,000, as the early traction we are seeing from our new initiatives was more than offset by continued competitive intensity,” Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong said during an earnings call today, according to a Motley Fool transcript.

Comcast’s residential broadband customers dropped to 28.72 million, while business broadband customers dropped to 2.54 million, for a total of 31.26 million.

Armstrong said that average revenue per user grew 1.1 percent, “consistent with the deceleration that we had previewed reflecting our new go-to-market pricing, including lower everyday pricing and strong adoption of free wireless lines.” Armstrong expects average revenue per user to continue growing slowly “for the next couple of quarters, driven by the absence of a rate increase, the impact from free wireless lines, and the ongoing migration of our base to simplified pricing.”

Comcast Connectivity & Platforms chief Steve Croney said the firm is facing “a more competitive environment from fiber” and continued competition from fixed wireless. “The market is going to remain intensely competitive,” he said.

Cavanagh said that over the past year, Comcast “made the most significant go-to-market shift in our company’s history. We have simplified our broadband offering by moving away from short-term promotions toward a clear, transparent value proposition.” But more changes are needed, he said.

“Looking ahead, 2026 is about building on the changes we made in 2025… This will be the largest broadband investment year in our history, focused squarely on customer experience and simplification, with the goal of migrating the majority of residential broadband customers to our new simplified pricing and packaging by year-end,” Cavanagh said.

Comcast’s domestic broadband revenue was $6.32 billion, down from $6.38 billion a year ago. Cable TV revenue was $6.36 billion, down from $6.74 billion year over year. Mobile revenue rose from $1.19 billion to $1.40 billion year over year, buoyed by 1.5 million new mobile lines added during the full year of 2025.

Comcast said it now has over 9 million total mobile lines and aims to get more of its broadband customers into bundles of Internet and wireless service. Comcast offers consumer mobile service through an agreement with Verizon and struck a deal with T-Mobile to deliver mobile services to business customers this year.

As the owner of NBCUniversal, Comcast has a lot more going on than cable and mobile. Strong results in the Peacock streaming service and Universal Studios theme parks helped Comcast meet analysts’ revenue projections and exceed profit estimates. Peacock paid subscribers increased 22 percent year over year to 44 million, and revenue grew 23 percent to 1.6 billion in the quarter, Comcast said.

Total Q4 2025 revenue was $32.31 billion, up 1.2 percent year over year. Net income was $2.17 billion, a 54.6 percent drop compared to a profit of $4.78 billion in Q4 2024. Comcast indicated the drop isn’t as bad as it sounds because it reflects “an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period, which included a $1.9 billion income tax benefit due to an internal corporate reorganization.” Comcast’s stock price was up about 3 percent today but has fallen about 16 percent in the past 12 months.

Comcast is one of the two biggest cable companies in the US alongside Charter, which is scheduled to announce Q4 2025 earnings tomorrow. In Q3 2025, Charter reported a loss of 109,000 Internet customers, a bit more than Comcast’s 104,000-customer loss in the same quarter. Charter, which is seeking regulatory approval to buy cable company Cox, had 27.76 million residential Internet customers and 2.03 million small business Internet customers.

            <h2>She'll mess with Texas: Nurse keeps mailing abortion pills, despite Paxton lawsuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/i-dont-fear-ken-paxton-nurse-vows-to-keep-shipping-abortion-pills-to-texas/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Texas fight with a nurse practitioner may eventually push the Supreme Court to settle an intensifying battle between states with strict abortion-ban laws and those with shield laws to protect abortion providers supporting out-of-state patients.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accused Debra Lynch, a Delaware-based nurse practitioner, of breaking Texas laws by shipping abortion pills that Lynch once estimated last January facilitated “up to 162 abortions per week” in the state.

“No one, regardless of where they live, will be freely allowed to aid in the murder of unborn children in Texas,” Paxton’s press release said.

In August, Paxton sent a cease-and-desist letter to shut down Lynch’s website, Her Safe Harbor, which she runs with her husband, Jay, a former communications director for Delaware’s health and social services department, alongside other volunteer licensed prescribers.

Fretting that Her Safe Harbor continues to advertise that Texas patients can get access to abortion pills “within days,” Paxton characterized Her Safe Harbor as an “extremist group” supposedly endangering women and unborn children in the state. To support that claim, Paxton cited two unrelated lawsuits where men allegedly ordered pills from other providers to poison pregnant partners and force miscarriages.

But Lynch told The New York Times that her lawyers advised her to ignore the demand letter, because Delaware’s shield law is one of the strongest in the country. Just before Paxton sent the letter, Delaware’s law was updated to clarify that it specifically “provides protection from civil and criminal actions that arise in another state that are based on the provision of health care services that are legal in Delaware,” the Times noted. And “even before that,” she said her lawyers “advised her that Delaware’s shield law protects her work.”

Paxton seems to expect the court will agree that shield laws cannot overrule state abortion ban laws or laws prohibiting out-of-state health practitioners from operating on Texans without a state license. His lawsuit demands a temporary and permanent injunction shutting down Her Safe Harbor, as well as the highest possible fines.

In a loss, Lynch could owe millions, as each mail order would be considered a violation of the state’s Human Life Protection Act, Paxton alleged, triggering a minimum $100,000 fine per violation. She could also face substantial jail time, the Austin American-Statesman reported, since Texas abortion “providers risk up to 99 years in prison.”

However, Lynch told the Times on Wednesday that the lawsuit will not stop her from shipping pills into Texas. She’s been anticipating this fight since at least the beginning of last year and remains committed to helping pregnant people in states with strict abortion laws get support from a qualified health provider. She fears that otherwise, they’ll feel driven to take riskier steps that could endanger their lives.

“I don’t fear Ken Paxton,” Lynch told the Statesman last January. “I don’t fear getting arrested or anything like that.”

This is the third lawsuit Paxton has filed against an out-of-state abortion pill provider, his press release noted. Legal experts who support abortion ban laws, as well as those supporting abortion shield laws, told the NYT they expect the Supreme Court to eventually weigh the arguments on both sides. If that happened, it could impact law enforcement in about a third of states with “near-total” abortion bans, as well as more than 20 states that enacted abortion shield laws.

To Lynch, abortion ban laws have already proven disastrous, doing more harm than good.

The Statesman cited data from the Society of Family Planning (SFP), showing that after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, medication abortion by telehealth became much more popular in the US. In 2022, this type of service accounted for approximately 1 in 25 abortions; by 2024, the numbers had shot to 1 in 5.

“Nearly half of those prescriptions went to patients in states with abortion bans or restrictions on telehealth abortion,” the Statesman reported, and SFP’s data showed that Texas residents, particularly, were turning more to telehealth. In the first half of 2024, 2,800 Texans per month received abortion medication by mail, which was “more than any other abortion-restricted state,” the data showed.

SFP also found that, overall, abortions had increased following tighter restrictions, totaling more than 1 million in 2023, which SFP noted was “the highest number in more than a decade.”

Lynch told the Statesman that abortion-ban laws “hadn’t stopped her from mailing the medications. They hadn’t stopped patients from receiving them. They just created hundreds of miles between patients and providers,” leaving women “feeling isolated and afraid to access a procedure that’s legal in half the country, and which had been legal everywhere in the US for half a century.”

“They’re truly alone,” Lynch said. “That frightens the hell out of me.”

Lynch’s case, or one of the other Texas lawsuits, could put shield laws to the test and one day clarify for all US residents if medication abortion by telehealth is legal in states with more restrictive laws.

A win could back up shield laws and block Texas from prosecuting providers like Lynch, as well as from enforcing proposed laws like Texas’ House Bill 991. If passed, that law would let Texas residents sue Internet service providers for failing to block abortion pill providers’ websites.

On the Her Safe Harbor website, Lynch and her partners say that patient safety is their priority and that they go beyond what typical providers offer to ensure that people seeking abortions are well cared for. The website details which abortion pills patients will receive (Mifepristone and Misoprostol), while, unlike other abortion providers, also sends pain and nausea medication at no cost. Both the NYT and the Statesman’s reporters confirmed that Her Safe Harbor is also available for patients to check in with any questions or concerns throughout the process.

Paxton seems fixated on Her Safe Harbor’s claims that orders can be shipped to all states, regardless of state laws, which he alleged makes women not seeking abortions vulnerable to attacks by male partners.

However, Her Safe Harbor takes steps to speak directly with patients in states with the most restrictive abortion laws. An Ars test showed that patients seeking consultations from such states are encouraged to call health care providers directly, rather than submit a form that their state could try to subpoena, a step that could prevent the kinds of attacks that Paxton fears. Of course, anyone can still choose to initiate the process using the consultation form, with Her Safe Harbor providing reassurances that the group “has never and will never disclose any private health data to any authority. We will not comply if we are ever subpoenaed.”

In email comments, Jay Lynch, who helps run Her Safe Harbor with his wife, told Ars that Paxton’s lawsuit is not trying to “protect life” but seeking to “silence medicine.”

“Every day, we provide evidence-based medical care to women who are scared, vulnerable, and often out of options,” Jay said. “We assess medical history. We evaluate risk. We follow clinical guidelines. We act to prevent complications, hospitalizations, infertility, and death. That is what medicine is supposed to do: save lives and reduce harm.”

Jay accused Paxton of “trying to expand state control across borders” and “intimidate providers everywhere.”

“This lawsuit is not about patient safety,” Jay said. “It is about who gets to decide what care is allowed: trained medical professionals—or politicians with no clinical expertise.”

To Jay, a win for Paxton would put patients in a risky place, forcing doctors and nurses to choose between “doing what is medically right, or doing what is politically ‘safe.’”

“That is a dangerous place for any healthcare system to be,” Jay said, noting that “when politicians override clinicians, patients pay the price” through delayed treatment, worsening injuries, preventable emergencies, lost fertility, or their lives.

Working with her husband and other providers, Lynch told the NYT that Her Safe Harbor is currently shipping out hundreds of packages a month. She vowed that as long as threats to abortion access continued to risk women’s lives, the shipments would never stop.

“Women are losing their lives and children are winding up orphans, and babies are being born with non-life-sustaining medical conditions” due to abortion bans and restrictive laws, Lynch told the NYT. “As long as that is happening, there’s absolutely nothing or nobody that will deter us from our mission to bring health care to women.”</div>

            <h2>What ice fishing can teach us about making foraging decisions</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/what-ice-fishing-can-teach-us-about-making-foraging-decisions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ice fishing is a longstanding tradition in Nordic countries, with competitions proving especially popular. Those competitions can also tell scientists something about how social cues influence how we make foraging decisions, according to a new paper published in the journal Science.

Humans are natural foragers in even the most extreme habitats, digging up tubers in the tropics, gathering mushrooms, picking berries, hunting seals in the Arctic, and fishing to meet our dietary needs. Human foraging is sufficiently complex that scientists believe that meeting so many diverse challenges helped our species develop memory, navigational abilities, social learning skills, and similar advanced cognitive functions.

Researchers are interested in this question not just because it could help refine existing theories of social decision-making, but also could improve predictions about how different groups of humans might respond and adapt to changes in their environment. Per the authors, prior research in this area has tended to focus on solitary foragers operating in a social vacuum. And even when studying social foraging decisions, it’s typically done using computational modeling and/or in the laboratory.

“We wanted to get out of the lab,” said co-author Ralf Kurvers of Max Planck Institute for Human Development and TU Berlin. “The methods commonly used in cognitive psychology are difficult to scale to large, real-world social contexts. Instead, we took inspiration from studies of animal collective behavior, which routinely use cameras to automatically record behavior and GPS to provide continuous movement data for large groups of animals.”

Kurvers et al. organized 10 three-hour ice-fishing competitions on 10 lakes in eastern Finland for their study, with 74 experienced ice fishers participating. Each ice fisher wore a GPS tracker and a head-mounted camera so that the researchers could capture real-time data on their movements, interactions, and how successful they were in their fishing attempts. All told, they recorded over 16,000 individual decisions specifically about location choice and when to change locations. That data was then compared to the team’s computational cognitive models and agent-based simulations.

According to the authors, three specific kinds of information hold the most sway over ice fishers’ decisions: their personal catch experience, how other ice fishers behaved, and factors in the environment, such as how a lakebed is structured. For example, an ice fisher who makes a successful catch tends to rely more on their own judgment and is more likely to ramp up their search for further prey nearby—i.e., an “area-restricted search&quot;—even more so in areas where there is a high density of ice fishers. Social density increases the likelihood of sticking with a location.

By contrast, failing to catch any fish was more likely to motivate an ice fisher to move to a new, more promising location, often choosing a new location where there was a higher density of other ice fishers. Environmental factors had much less influence than social cues.

“Ice fishers go to areas where other individuals are fishing,” the authors wrote. “This social information is integrated with their own catching success: when ice fishers catch fish, they move to nearby areas, but they move further away when not catching any fish. Social information was less important for the decision when to leave a spot compared with personal information on catching success. This suggests adaptive, context-dependent mechanisms of social and personal information integration that are systematically linked to the requirements of each task.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two security professionals who were arrested in 2019 after performing an authorized security assessment of a county courthouse in Iowa will receive $600,000 to settle a lawsuit they brought alleging wrongful arrest and defamation.

The case was brought by Gary DeMercurio and Justin Wynn, two penetration testers who at the time were employed by Colorado-based security firm Coalfire Labs. The men had written authorization from the Iowa Judicial Branch to conduct “red-team” exercises, meaning attempted security breaches that mimic techniques used by criminal hackers or burglars.

The objective of such exercises is to test the resilience of existing defenses using the types of real-world attacks the defenses are designed to repel. The rules of engagement for this exercise explicitly permitted “physical attacks,” including “lockpicking,” against judicial branch buildings so long as they didn’t cause significant damage.

The event galvanized security and law enforcement professionals. Despite the legitimacy of the work and the legal contract that authorized it, DeMercurio and Wynn were arrested on charges of felony third-degree burglary and spent 20 hours in jail, until they were released on $100,000 bail ($50,000 for each). The charges were later reduced to misdemeanor trespassing charges, but even then, Chad Leonard, sheriff of Dallas County, where the courthouse was located, continued to allege publicly that the men had acted illegally and should be prosecuted.

Reputational hits from these sorts of events can be fatal to a security professional’s career. And of course, the prospect of being jailed for performing authorized security assessment is enough to get the attention of any penetration tester, not to mention the customers that hire them.

“This incident didn’t make anyone safer,” Wynn said in a statement. “It sent a chilling message to security professionals nationwide that helping [a] government identify real vulnerabilities can lead to arrest, prosecution, and public disgrace. That undermines public safety, not enhances it.”

DeMercurio and Wynn’s engagement at the Dallas County Courthouse on September 11, 2019, had been routine. A little after midnight, after finding a side door to the courthouse unlocked, the men closed it and let it lock. They then slipped a makeshift tool through a crack in the door and tripped the locking mechanism. After gaining entry, the pentesters tripped an alarm alerting authorities.

Within minutes, deputies arrived and confronted the two intruders. DeMercurio and Wynn produced an authorization letter—known as a “get out of jail free card” in pen-testing circles. After a deputy called one or more of the state court officials listed in the letter and got confirmation it was legit, the deputies said they were satisfied the men were authorized to be in the building. DeMercurio and Wynn spent the next 10 or 20 minutes telling what their attorney in a court document called “war stories” to deputies who had asked about the type of work they do.

When Sheriff Leonard arrived, the tone suddenly changed. He said the Dallas County Courthouse was under his jurisdiction and he hadn’t authorized any such intrusion. Leonard had the men arrested, and in the days and weeks to come, he made numerous remarks alleging the men violated the law. A couple months after the incident, he told me that surveillance video from that night showed “they were crouched down like turkeys peeking over the balcony” when deputies were responding. I published a much more detailed account of the event here. Eventually, all charges were dismissed.

DeMercurio and Wynn sued Dallas County and Leonard for false arrest, abuse of process, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malicious prosecution. The case dragged on for years. Last Thursday, five days before a trial was scheduled to begin in the case, Dallas County officials agreed to pay $600,000 to settle the case.

It’s hard to overstate the financial, emotional, and professional stresses that result when someone is locked up and repeatedly accused of criminal activity for performing authorized work that’s clearly in the public interest. DeMercurio has now started his own firm, Kaiju Security.

“The settlement confirms what we have said from the beginning: our work was authorized, professional, and done in the public interest,” DeMercurio said. “What happened to us never should have happened. Being arrested for doing the job we were hired to do turned our lives upside down and damaged reputations we spent years building.”</div>

            <h2>New OpenAI tool renews fears that “AI slop” will overwhelm scientific research</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/new-openai-tool-renews-fears-that-ai-slop-will-overwhelm-scientific-research/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, OpenAI released a free AI-powered workspace for scientists. It’s called Prism, and it has drawn immediate skepticism from researchers who fear the tool will accelerate the already overwhelming flood of low-quality papers into scientific journals. The launch coincides with growing alarm among publishers about what many are calling “AI slop” in academic publishing.

To be clear, Prism is a writing and formatting tool, not a system for conducting research itself, though OpenAI’s broader pitch blurs that line.

Prism integrates OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 model into a LaTeX-based text editor (a standard used for typesetting documents), allowing researchers to draft papers, generate citations, create diagrams from whiteboard sketches, and collaborate with co-authors in real time. The tool is free for anyone with a ChatGPT account.

“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” Kevin Weil, vice president of OpenAI for Science, told reporters at a press briefing attended by MIT Technology Review. He said that ChatGPT receives about 8.4 million messages per week on “hard science” topics, which he described as evidence that AI is transitioning from curiosity to core workflow for scientists.

OpenAI built Prism on technology from Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company acquired in late 2025. The company envisions Prism helping researchers spend less time on tedious formatting tasks and more time on actual science. During a demonstration, an OpenAI employee showed how the software could automatically find and incorporate relevant scientific literature, then format the bibliography.

But AI models are tools, and any tool can be misused. The risk here is specific: By making it easy to produce polished, professional-looking manuscripts, tools like Prism could flood the peer review system with papers that don’t meaningfully advance their fields. The barrier to producing science-flavored text is dropping, but the capacity to evaluate that research has not kept pace.

When asked about the possibility of the AI model confabulating fake citations, Weil acknowledged in the press demo that “none of this absolves the scientist of the responsibility to verify that their references are correct.”

Unlike traditional reference management software (such as EndNote), which has formatted citations for over 30 years without inventing them, AI models can generate plausible-sounding sources that don’t exist. Weil added: “We’re conscious that as AI becomes more capable, there are concerns around volume, quality, and trust in the scientific community.”

Those concerns are not hypothetical, as we have previously covered. A December 2025 study published in the journal Science found that researchers using large language models to write papers increased their output by 30 to 50 percent, depending on the field. But those AI-assisted papers performed worse in peer review. Papers with complex language written without AI assistance were most likely to be accepted by journals, while papers with complex language likely written by AI models were less likely to be accepted. Reviewers apparently recognized that sophisticated prose was masking weak science.

“It is a very widespread pattern across different fields of science,” Yian Yin, an information science professor at Cornell University and one of the study’s authors, told the Cornell Chronicle. “There’s a big shift in our current ecosystem that warrants a very serious look, especially for those who make decisions about what science we should support and fund.”

Another analysis of 41 million papers published between 1980 and 2025 found that while AI-using scientists receive more citations and publish more papers, the collective scope of scientific exploration appears to be narrowing. Lisa Messeri, a sociocultural anthropologist at Yale University, told Science magazine that these findings should set off “loud alarm bells” for the research community.

“Science is nothing but a collective endeavor,” she said. “There needs to be some deep reckoning with what we do with a tool that benefits individuals but destroys science.”

Concerns about AI-generated scientific content are not new. In 2022, Meta pulled a demo of Galactica, a large language model designed to write scientific literature, after users discovered it could generate convincing nonsense on any topic, including a wiki entry about a fictional research paper called “The benefits of eating crushed glass.” Two years later, Tokyo-based Sakana AI announced “The AI Scientist,” an autonomous research system that critics on Hacker News dismissed as producing “garbage” papers. “As an editor of a journal, I would likely desk-reject them,” one commenter wrote at the time. “They contain very limited novel knowledge.”

The problem has only grown worse since then. In his first editorial of 2026 for Science, Editor-in-Chief H. Holden Thorp wrote that the journal is “less susceptible” to AI slop because of its size and human editorial investment, but he warned that “no system, human or artificial, can catch everything.” Science currently allows limited AI use for editing and gathering references but requires disclosure for anything beyond that and prohibits AI-generated figures.

Mandy Hill, managing director of academic publishing at Cambridge University Press & Assessment, has been even more blunt. In October 2025, she told Retraction Watch that the publishing ecosystem is under strain and called for “radical change.” She explained to the University of Cambridge publication Varsity that “too many journal articles are being published, and this is causing huge strain” and warned that AI “will exacerbate” the problem.

OpenAI is serious about leaning on its ability to accelerate science, and the company laid out its case for AI-assisted research in a report published earlier this week. It profiles researchers who say AI models have sped up their work, including a mathematician who used GPT-5.2 to solve an open problem in optimization over three evenings and a physicist who watched the model reproduce symmetry calculations that had taken him months to derive.

Those examples go beyond writing assistance into using AI for actual research work, a distinction OpenAI’s marketing intentionally blurs. For scientists who don’t speak English fluently, AI writing tools could legitimately accelerate the publication of good research. But that benefit may be offset by a flood of mediocre submissions jamming up an already strained peer-review system.

Weil told MIT Technology Review that his goal is not to produce a single AI-generated discovery but rather “10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn’t have happened as quickly.” He described this as “an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

Whether that acceleration produces more scientific knowledge or simply more scientific papers remains to be seen. Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at UC Berkeley not connected to OpenAI, told MIT Technology Review that GPT-5 has already become valuable in his own work for polishing text and catching mathematical typos, making “interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

But by making papers look polished and professional regardless of their scientific merit, AI writing tools may help weak research clear the initial screening that editors and reviewers use to assess presentation quality. The risk is that conversational workflows obscure assumptions and blur accountability, and they might overwhelm the still very human peer review process required to vet it all.

OpenAI appears aware of this tension. Its public statements about Prism emphasize that the tool will not conduct research independently and that human scientists remain responsible for verification.

Still, one commenter on Hacker News captured the anxiety spreading through technical communities: “I’m scared that this type of thing is going to do to science journals what AI-generated bug reports is doing to bug bounties. We’re truly living in a post-scarcity society now, except that the thing we have an abundance of is garbage, and it’s drowning out everything of value.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Humans can’t live without lungs. And yet for 48 hours, in a surgical suite at Northwestern University, a 33-year-old man lived with an empty cavity in his chest where his lungs used to be. He was kept alive by a custom-engineered artificial device that represented a desperate last-ditch effort by his doctors. The custom hardware solved a physiological puzzle that has made bilateral pneumonectomy, the removal of both lungs, extremely risky before now.

The artificial lung system was built by the team of Ankit Bharat, a surgeon and researcher at Northwestern. It successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable a double lung transplant, temporarily replacing his entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The system creates a blueprint for saving people previously considered beyond hope by transplant teams.

The patient, a once-healthy 33-year-old, arrived at the hospital with Influenza B complicated by a secondary, severe infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that in this case proved resistant even to carbapenems—our antibiotics of last resort. This combination of infections triggered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition where the lungs become so inflamed and fluid-filled that oxygen can no longer reach the blood.

In this case, the infections were necrotizing—the cells in the lungs were dying, turning his lung tissue into a liquid. The surgeons faced a seemingly impossible choice. The patient needed a transplant to survive, but he was in refractory septic shock. His kidneys were shutting down, and his heart was failing to the point where it completely stopped shortly after hospital admission. The doctors had to bring him back with CPR.

He was too sick for a transplant, yet the very organs that needed replacing were the source of the infection fueling his decline. “When the infection is so severe that the lungs are melting, they’re irrecoverably damaged,” Bharat explained. “That’s when patients die.”

To save him, Bharat’s team had to remove the infected lungs, a procedure called a bilateral pneumonectomy, to remove the source of the sepsis. We have machines that can oxygenate the blood. But removing both lungs creates a lethal mechanical problem for the heart.

The human heart is two pumps in one. The right side, called the pulmonary circuit, pumps oxygen-poor blood returning from the body into the lungs, which remove its carbon dioxide and load it with a fresh supply of oxygen. The left side, known as the systemic circuit, receives freshly oxygenated blood and pumps it to the rest of the body. The pulmonary vascular bed, all these miles of tiny vessels inside the lungs, facilitates this gas exchange. But it also acts as a capacitor, absorbing the pressure and volume of the blood ejected by the right ventricle.

If you remove the lungs and simply shut the pulmonary arteries, the right ventricle has nowhere to pump—it would experience an immediate, massive pressure spike, distend like a balloon, and fail within minutes. At the same time, the left side of the heart would have no blood returning to it, leading to a total collapse of blood pressure and systemic circulation.

This is the reason why most double-lung transplants are performed sequentially: The surgeons replace one lung, get it up and running, and then move on to the second. But desperate times require desperate measures.

In rare cases where both lungs must be removed at once, a patient can still be supported by the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a mechanical lung that takes blood out of the body, removes the carbon dioxide, adds oxygen, and pumps it back in. The problem is that while ECMO can support a person for up to over a year when their lungs are still in their body, the risks of using it skyrocket when the lungs are removed.

The empty chest cavity creates a void where blood and fluids can pool, leading to huge internal bleeding. The heart, which relies on the physical presence and pressure of the lungs to maintain its proper anatomical position, can flop around or collapse. Finally, circulating blood through complex machinery significantly increases the risk of stroke or clotting.

Because of all these risks, surgeons always treat removing both lungs as the last line of defense, one they can only rely on for a short time—the shorter the better. Bharat and his colleagues, though, had to keep their patient this way until the sepsis had been dealt with.

It wasn’t enough for the team to keep the patient alive without lungs in his body until the transplant arrived. In this lungless state, somehow, they had to improve his health.

To make this happen, Bharat’s team engineered a device they called the “flow-adaptive extracorporeal total artificial lung system” (TAL), a complex circuit designed to mimic the physics of the missing organs. At its core was a pump and an oxygenator borrowed from the standard ECMO setup, but it also used four new components to replace biological functions.

The first was a dual-lumen cannula, essentially a single tube with two separate channels inside. Inserted through the internal jugular vein, this tube acted as the primary drain. It allowed the team to pull deoxygenated blood directly from the right side of the heart, unloading the right ventricle to prevent it from distending.

The second component was something the researchers called a flow-adaptive shunt, which connected the right pulmonary artery back to the right atrium. When the right ventricle pumped out more blood than the external pump could handle, the excess blood would safely recirculate back into the atrium through this low-resistance path, protecting the heart and the surgical staples from pressure spikes. During the 48 hours the patient was supported by the TAL, this shunt self-regulated its flow to anywhere between 1.1 and 6.3 liters per minute, based on the patient’s needs.

To ensure the left side of the heart stayed full and active, the team used a device called dual left atrial return. It comprised two 10 mm grafts that returned oxygenated blood from the ECMO artificial lung directly into the left atrium. This, the team said in a paper that describes the hardware, maintained what’s called Starling physiology: the principle that the heart pumps better when it is properly filled. It also prevented blood from stagnating and forming clots inside the heart chambers.

Finally, to prevent the heart from physically shifting and damaging vital vessels in the empty chest cavity, the surgeons used bovine pericardium to reconstruct the heart’s protective sac and filled the empty space with tissue expanders and surgical sponges.

The results of hooking the patient up to TAL were immediate.

Within hours of the surgery, the patient’s septic shock began to resolve. His lactate levels, a key marker of tissue oxygen starvation, dropped from a dangerous 8.2 mmol/L to a normal level of less than 1.0 mmol/L within 24 hours. The medications used to keep his blood pressure up were discontinued after just 12 hours.

For two days, the patient lived as a human being with no lungs, stabilized by a machine that breathed and buffered his circulation with surgical precision. When donor lungs became available 48 hours later, the patient’s body was no longer suffering from sepsis.

He was ready for the transplant, which the team successfully performed. And after putting in the new lungs, they focused on the lungs they had removed.

Conventionally, patients with ARDS do not get transplants because doctors hope that with the right treatment and support, the diseased lungs will eventually heal. But the examination of the infected lungs removed from Bharat’s patient told a different story and helped define the clinical point of no return, when a lung is truly dead.

Based on the spatial transcriptomics, a set of techniques that let scientists see which genes are active at different sites in the tissue, the team built a high-resolution molecular map of the removed lungs. What they found was a landscape of total devastation.

The lungs were filled with aberrant basaloid cells—a signature of failed regeneration. The stem cells required to rebuild the lungs were almost entirely gone. The architecture was uniformly destroyed and replaced by cells that were laying down scar tissue.

“People think if you get severe ARDS, you keep supporting them and ultimately the lungs will get better,” Bharat says.  The data collected by his team suggested no amount of waiting or life support would have brought this patient’s lungs back to life. “In my practice, young patients die almost every week because no one realized that transplantation was an option,” Bharat added.

In many hospitals, patients with severe, acute lung infections are often allowed to die because they are considered too unstable for surgery. While Bharat’s study offers some hope that this situation might improve in the future, the team admits that their approach currently requires immense expertise and access to a highly specialized medical center with donor lungs. Making expertise and resources more accessible will take some time.

And that’s not the only thing we have to wait for. Bharat and his colleagues note in their paper that one key challenge in ARDS is determining whether the injury is reversible. His study offers some initial insights into diagnosing irreversible damage, but the researchers note that their conclusions were based on a single case. The features of lungs that are beyond repair may differ across various pathogens, stages of disease, or the way individual patient’s body responds to the disease.

For Bharat’s patient, though, all possible stars aligned. The paper says that two years after the procedure, he has returned to a normal, independent life with excellent lung function.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is gearing up for the first crewed journey to the Moon in over half a century, a mission that could launch as soon as two weeks from now.

And next year, the agency will finally attempt to return astronauts to the lunar surface itself as part of its Artemis 3 mission, which will dramatically increase the already considerable stakes.

Particularly when it comes to stepping out of the spacecraft — the agency has yet to pick between Blue Origin and SpaceX’s offerings in that regard — staying protected from the extreme temperature swings, space radiation, and lack of atmosphere is extremely challenging.

That’s not to mention the physical limitations of an extremely bulky spacesuit, which could physically tax astronauts even more than stepping outside of the International Space Station during a spacewalk.

As Ars Technica reports, former NASA astronaut and microbiologist Kate Rubins, who retired last year and has logged 300 days in space, recently voiced her concerns over the Moon suit that private space company Axiom Space has been developing for NASA as part of a $228 million contract.

“What I think we have on the Moon that we don’t really have on the space station that I want people to recognize is an extreme physical stress,” she said during a recent meeting of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Besides not getting any sleep, Rubin warned that people will be “in these suits for eight or nine hours” and doing extravehicular activities (EVAs) “every day.”

Compared to the suits NASA astronauts wore during the Apollo missions, the Axiom Space suit is considerably heavier. While a sixth of gravity will greatly alleviate some of that heft, they still weigh in at 300 pounds. At the same time, Moon walkers will enjoy greatly enhanced flexibility, allowing them to kneel down to pick up objects, for instance.

“I think the suits are better than Apollo, but I don’t think they are great right now,” Rubin warned, noting “flexibility issues” and the reality that “people are going to be falling over.”

In remarks directly to Ars, Rubin elaborated, emphasizing that the suits are “definitely much better than Apollo,” but remain “still quite heavy.”

Even something as simple as getting back up after a fall — as demonstrated by the many Apollo astronauts who took a tumble while on the Moon — involves a type of “jumping pushup,” as Rubins told Ars, which is a “non-trivial” and “risky maneuver.”

Not everybody is as concerned about the Axiom Space suit. Current NASA astronaut and physician Mike Barratt argued in remarks during the committee meeting that the “suit is getting there,” pointing out that “we’ve got 700 hours of pressurized experience in it right now.”

“Bending down in the suit is really not too bad at all,” he added.

NASA still plans to conduct plenty of tests involving the suit, including parabolic flight, which can simulate the partial gravity of the Moon’s surface. The agency has already put the suit through its paces underwater at NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab.

The agency has until sometime next year to finalize the design for its long-awaited Artemis 3 mission to the lunar surface. At the same time, NASA still has plenty of decisions to make, including how to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, remotely-operated ground robots have become a startlingly common sight on the battlefield.

According to the defense policy think tank, the Jamestown Foundation, Ukraine has turned into a world leader in unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), allowing the country’s military to coordinate robotic warfare while reducing casualties.

Now, a video making the rounds on social media appears to show three Russian soldiers emerging from a building with their arms raised and surrendering to a robot armed with a machine gun. One of the soldiers appears to be covered in blood, adding to the sense of surreal darkness. A separate drone appears to be trained on the soldiers as well.

According to the Ukrainian military news outlet Militarnyi, the robot was a reconnaissance-strike ground unit dubbed Droid TW, built by Ukrainian defense company DevDroid. The washing machine-sized platform uses AI to autonomously identify targets and can shoot 7.62mm caliber rounds. The robot was developed at the request of the First Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian army, which was seeking a way to evacuate wounded soldiers under heavy fire — but considering the footage, the army may have found a different use for it as well.

The Jamestown Foundation noted that Ukrainian UVGs are “increasingly replacing infantry in high-risk missions, providing sustained firepower, engineering support, and resilience against electronic warfare, terrain challenges, and prolonged deployments.”

The country has had to seriously step up its game, with 40 Ukrainian defense companies producing 99 percent of UGVs domestically. As The Economist reported last year, there are around 200 different models of these robots, ranging from AI-enabled anti-drone laser guns to ground-based machine-gun platforms.

Other robots can lay down anti-tank mines, transport tons of materials for infantry on the front lines, or provide cover from the air under heavy artillery to exfiltrate injured soldiers. Some are outfitted with dozens of pounds of explosives to self-destruct near fortifications or bridges.

Ukraine is also getting a hand from Western defense companies, like German firm ARX Robotics, which is manufacturing a fleet of small tank-like UGVs.

Apart from videos of Russian soldiers surrendering, we’ve seen footage of UGVs engaging Russian armored personnel carriers. We’ve also seen other buggy-sized “Droid” UGVs, built by DevDroid, fighting with Russian infantry.

In short, the frontlines of the Russia-Ukraine war are a weird laboratory for modern warfare, which, against all odds, has given Ukraine a considerable tactical edge over its much larger adversary.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, news emerged that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was considering taking his private space company public on his birthday in June at a staggering valuation of $1.5 trillion, making it easily the largest IPO in history.

Now, as Reuters reports, Musk is hoping to go one step further, merging his AI startup xAI with SpaceX ahead of the IPO — a baffling plan that raises far more questions than answers.

For now, we have no idea why the deal is even on the table, let alone the financial specifics. The narrative will likely have something to do with SpaceX helping xAI launch data centers into Earth’s orbit — an idea that AI tech leaders have become obsessed with as of late, despite experts warning it makes little sense, citing concerns over economic viability and bandwidth limitations.

“The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space,” Musk said during an interview in Davos last week. “And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.”

Other companies, most notably Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, are also looking to launch thousands of satellites that will ultimately serve data centers from space. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also been infatuated by the idea, arguing that bringing data centers closer to the Sun could allow them to reap practically unlimited amounts of solar energy while in orbit.

According to Reuters, two entities in Nevada, including a limited liability company that lists SpaceX chief financial officer Bret Johnsen, have been set up to facilitate the swapping of xAI and SpaceX shares. A source told the news agency that xAI executives could receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal.

SpaceX already agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI last year as part of the startup’s fundraising round. Both xAI and SpaceX have secured major defense contracts with the Pentagon. Just earlier this year, defense secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that Musk’s AI chatbot Grok will be operating inside Pentagon networks.

SpaceX is also developing a national security version of its Starlink broadband internet network, called Starshield, which is expected to use AI to track targets back on the surface, according to Reuters.

Musk is no stranger to merging his own businesses. Last year, for instance, he folded his social media echo chamber X into xAI. His embattled EV maker, Tesla, is also seemingly getting in on the fun, announcing that it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI earlier this week, after reporting some disastrous earnings.

            <h2>Sam Altman Says Oops, They Accidentally Made the New Version of ChatGPT Worse Than the Previous One</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been a little over three years since the launch of the first commercially-available large language model (LLM) chatbot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. And though the AI model has certainly made performance gains since it came online, the lackluster performance of recent iterations hasn’t helped the perception that LLMs are hitting a plateau.

Case in point, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently conceded that the company had “screwed up” the language capabilities of its latest chatbot iteration, GPT-5.2.

“I think we just screwed that up,” Altman said at a developer town hall on Monday. “We will make future versions of GPT 5.x hopefully much better at writing than 4.5 was.”

Continuing, Altman said that the company chose to focus on ChatGPT’s technical capabilities, perhaps to the detriment of its human-language performance.

“We did decide, and I think for good reason, to put most of our effort in 5.2 into making it super good at intelligence, reasoning, coding, engineering, that kind of thing,” Altman said. “And we have limited bandwidth here, and sometimes we focus on one thing and neglect another.”

The admission raises a high-stakes question: whether frontier AI models can continue to excel at tasks across the board, or if proficiency in one domain will start to come at the expense of a broader skill set.

As Search Engine Journal points out, the release of GPT-5.2 came with a huge emphasis on technical tasks like coding and formatting spreadsheets. Compared to past iterations, there was scarce mention of any writing or creative work at all, a pivot which has left many non-technical users feeling like ChatGPT is hitting a wall.

As data scientist and tech blogger Mehul Gupta pointed out in a review of GPT-5.2, there are plenty of signs that the LLM is backsliding, and some of them aren’t particularly subtle.

These include a “flatter tone,” worse translation capability, inconsistent behavior across tasks, and some major regression in “instant mode,” a setting meant to provide immediate answers to simple questions.

As Gupta writes, it also struggles with real-world tasks. When it comes to evaluating human documents like contracts, mixed-format notes or PDFs, GPT-5.2 “forgot earlier details, contradicted itself, misread cross-references, [and] hallucinated clarifications that didn’t exist.”

“Benchmarks are clean,” Gupta observed. “Real documents are not. 5.2 still struggles with the noise of reality.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, social and news media was abuzz with allegations that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers had access to a shadowy database full of information on protestors.

During a confrontation with ICE agents, two legal observers had their faces scanned by a federal officer to include in a vague database. “We have a nice little database, and now you’re considered domestic terrorists,” the ICE agent said at the time.

It wasn’t clear at the moment whether the agent was bluffing. But now, new details reported by CNN reveal that Alex Pretti, the ICU nurse murdered by ICE agents in Minneapolis was indeed closely tracked by a border agent system before his killing.

According to the publication’s source, ICE already had a treasure trove of personal details about Pretti before his death on Saturday. As the story goes, info on Pretti’s physical identification was collected following a run-in a week prior to his death, with another gaggle of ICE officers who broke one of his ribs during the encounter.

That’s not the only documentation of this shadowy data collection. A memo circulating around the same time advised agents to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.”

And earlier this month, border czar Tom Homan told Fox News that he was pushing to create a “database where those people that are arrested for interference, impeding and assault,” because, as he put it, “we’re going to make them famous.”

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/waymo-strikes-elementary-child">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Waymo Robotaxi struck and injured a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California, the company admitted in a recent announcement, prompting an investigation by federal regulators.

The incident, which took place on January 23, occurred after the child “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly in our vehicle’s path,” Waymo claimed. The robotaxi “immediately detected” the pedestrian and “braked hard,” slowing down from 17 miles per hour to under 6 miles per hour, before colliding with the child.

“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911,” the company claimed. “The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene.”

That same day, Waymo says it reached out to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has now opened an investigation into the autonomous vehicle company. In its report to the regulator, Waymo said the child had sustained “minor injuries,” the NHTSA said in a recent filing.

The accident comes as Waymo is already under scrutiny from regulators over reports of its robotaxis illegally blowing past stopped school buses, ignoring their warning lights and extended stop arm. The NHTSA opened an investigation into the phenomenon last October, and last week, the National Transportation Safety Board ramped up the pressure on the company by announcing its own. Over 20 school bus incidents were reported in Austin, Texas, and at least six in Atlanta, Georgia. In a particularly brazen flouting of traffic laws, one Waymo allegedly drove near the students who were disembarking from the bus.

The regulators will be additionally concerned that Waymo has seemingly struggled to discipline its cars. Though it deployed a patch to address the school bus violations in November to over 3,000 of its robotaxis, an Austin school district reported at least one violation that occurred after the patch was applied.

That this latest incident also concerns school children may not be a coincidence. The NHTSA stated that the collision took place within two blocks of an elementary school during normal school drop off hours. There were also “other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity” — clear clues that a driver should pick up on to drive extra carefully.

The investigation will determine whether Waymo “exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”

In its own defense, Waymo argued that its simulation model showed that a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph,” which is several miles per hour faster than the Waymo’s reported speed.

            <h2>Fintech firm Marquis blames hack at firewall provider SonicWall for its data breach</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/fintech-firm-marquis-blames-hack-at-firewall-provider-sonicwall-for-its-data-breach/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fintech firm Marquis told customers that it plans to seek compensation from its firewall provider after blaming the company for a breach that allowed hackers to steal its customers’ personal and financial data.

In a memo shared with customers this week and seen by TechCrunch, Marquis said it believes that its August 2025 ransomware attack happened because the company’s firewall service provider SonicWall had its own data breach that exposed critical security information about its customers’ firewalls. That earlier breach of SonicWall allowed hackers to obtain credentials needed to launch a ransomware attack against Marquis, the memo said.

Marquis said its third-party investigation determined that the hackers obtained information about its firewall during the breach at SonicWall, which Marquis claims was used to circumvent its firewall. Marquis confirmed in the communication that it stored a backup of its firewall configuration file in SonicWall’s cloud.

The company was “evaluating its options” regarding its firewall provider, including the “recoupment of any expenses spent by Marquis and its customers in responding to the data incident,” according to the memo.

When reached for comment, Hanna Grimm, an agency spokesperson representing Marquis, did not address or dispute the company’s recent communication to customers, but reiterated the claim linking its breach with an earlier theft of its firewall configuration.

“In September 2025, after the data security incident affected our systems, our firewall service provider, an industry-leading cybersecurity company, publicly disclosed that a threat actor had earlier in the year gained unauthorized access to its cloud backup service,” the statement said.

“Marquis had recently begun using this provider’s firewalls to help protect our network,” the statement added. “While the provider initially reported that fewer than 5% of customers were affected, it later clarified in October 2025 that firewall configuration data and credentials associated with all customers using the cloud backup service, including Marquis, had been accessed.”

When contacted by TechCrunch, SonicWall spokesperson Bret Fitzgerald said that the company has asked Marquis for evidence to substantiate its claims and said it would continue to engage with its customer.

“We have no new evidence to establish a connection between the SonicWall security incident reported in September 2025 and ongoing global ransomware attacks on firewalls and other edge devices,” Fitzgerald said.

The Texas-based Marquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, began notifying hundreds of thousands of people last month that their information was taken during its ransomware attack.

The company has access to large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the U.S., including personal information, financial data, and Social Security numbers, which the hackers stole.

SonicWall conceded in October that an earlier breach of its systems had in fact affected all of its customers who backed up their firewall files to SonicWall’s cloud. It had previously said hackers stole only a fraction of its customers’ firewall configuration files containing policies and settings.

In the communication seen by TechCrunch, Marquis said it called in a third-party to investigate whether a patch it had failed to roll out at the time of the breach could have been to blame, but concluded that the patch related to a flaw that was not exploitable in a way that could have allowed hackers to access the company’s data.

Marquis’ spokesperson declined to provide a number of how many individuals are affected by its data breach. The number of individuals known to be affected by the breach is expected to rise as new data breach notifications are submitted to state attorneys general.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/satya-nadella-insists-people-are-using-microsofts-copilot-ai-a-lot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft delivered a solid earnings report on Wednesday with $81.3 billion in revenue for the quarter (up 17%), net income profits of $38.3 billion (up 21%), and a record-breaking Microsoft cloud revenue of over $50 billion.

But the stock was getting pounded on Thursday as investors worried about how much the tech giant was spending to build out its cloud and questioned whether that investment would pay off. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says the answer to that question is yes  — and spent considerable time on the earnings call trying to make that point.

Microsoft has spent almost as much on capital expenditures in the first half of its current fiscal year as it did in all of the previous year. And the numbers truly are enormous: Microsoft spent $88.2 billion on capital expenditures last year and has spent $72.4 billion so far this year.

Much of that spend is to serve AI to enterprises and major AI labs, especially OpenAI, as well as Anthropic. The big question on investors’ minds is: Will the spending turn into more use and ultimately profits?

Investors are scared that Microsoft’s main enterprise cloud product, Azure, and its Microsoft 365 apps didn’t grow as fast as they wanted.

“The fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we’re hearing,” Wall Street analyst for UBS, Karl Keirstead, wrote in his research note on Thursday. (Keirstead isn’t worried about it, though, and recommends buying the stock.)

Still, a few months ago, news reports circulated that people didn’t really want to use Microsoft’s AI, despite Copilot being weaved into all kinds of Microsoft products.

Nadella spent much of his time during the earnings call engaged in what is best described as AI use PR. Despite his pitch, some of the numbers he gave were pretty squishy.

For instance, Nadella said daily users of its consumer Copilot AI products had grown “nearly 3x year-over-year.” This refers to AI chats, the news feed, search, browsing, shopping, and “integrations into the operating system.”

As to how many actual users that represents, he didn’t say. (We’ve reached out to Microsoft and asked.)

Last year, in its annual report, the company said it surpassed 100 million monthly active Copilot users, but that counted both commercial users and consumers.

He was more up front with Microsoft’s coding AI, GitHub Copilot, saying it now has 4.7 million paid subscribers, up 75% year-over-year. That appears to be a healthy business. Last year, in its annual report, Microsoft said that GitHub Copilot had 20 million users, a figure that includes those opting for the free tier.

He also said Microsoft 365 Copilot now has 15 million paid seats from companies buying it for their employees. This is out of a base of 450 million paid seats, the company said.

And Nadella called out the growth of Dragon Copilot, Microsoft’s healthcare AI agent for medical professionals (a competitor to superhot startup Harvey). He said this product is available to 100,000 medical providers and was used to document 21 million patient encounters over the quarter, up threefold year-over-year.

Will the billions spent on data centers be worth it? Nadella obviously thinks so. He and CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call that demand for AI services across products far outstrips data center supply, so all of the new equipment is essentially booked to capacity for its lifespan.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX and xAI, both companies led by Elon Musk, could merge ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year, according to a report from Reuters. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.

Company representatives have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC.

Combining the two companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk has said he wants.

This move would also fall in line with Musk’s recent strategies to consolidate his companies. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to The Wall Street Journal, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, invested $2 billion in the AI startup.

Last year, xAI bought X in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. SpaceX, which has been around since 2002, reportedly launched a secondary sale that valued it at $800 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the U.S.

A recent Financial Times report indicated that Musk wants to take SpaceX public in June. Then again, Musk’s grand plans rarely happen on time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they’ve recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.

​As first reported by Reuters, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the live translation capability introduced last year.

The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.

The Financial Times reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple’s second-largest acquisition to date, after buying Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014.

​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he sold PrimeSense, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple’s transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.

Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.

The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple’s first quarterly earnings, in which analysts are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It’s also expected to be the company’s strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.

            <div id="article-text">After years of negotiations and false starts, Waymo is now allowed to operate a robotaxi service to and from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The Alphabet-owned company said in a blog post Thursday it will begin offering access to SFO to a select number of riders before offering it to all customers in the coming months.

Pickups and drop-offs will occur at the SFO Rental Car Center, which is accessible via AirTrain. Waymo said it plans to serve additional airport locations in the future.

Waymo’s SFO win comes as the company faces criticism and concerns about safety in some of the cities it operates. Waymo revealed Thursday that one of its robotaxis struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the January 23 incident, in which the child sustained minor injuries. Waymo is also being investigated by the NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board over the illegal behavior of its robotaxis around school buses.

Access to airports, and particularly SFO, is critical to Waymo’s business model, which hinges on geographic scale and a high volume of riders.

“Serving rides to and from San Francisco International Airport delivers one of the most requested features for our riders and further deepens our relationship with the city,” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement.

The company has accelerated its plans over the past year, launching into new cities, increasing its fleet size, and adding freeways to where it operates. Waymo robotaxis now service most of the San Francisco Bay Area and down into Silicon Valley, where it has access to the San Jose Airport. It also operates in parts of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, and most of Phoenix, including curbside service to the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

Waymo’s push to operate at SFO has taken years. It tried and failed to secure a permit in 2023 to map SFO, a first step to bringing its robotaxis there. Waymo then rebooted negotiations with the city and airport authority and was granted a permit in March 2025 that would allow it to map SFO with some data-sharing strings attached, according to language in the agreement viewed by TechCrunch at the time.

By September, SFO and Waymo signed a testing and operations pilot permit, pushing the company closer to commercial operations at the airport.

            <div id="article-text">Google DeepMind is opening up access to Project Genie, its AI tool for creating interactive game worlds from text prompts or images.

Starting Thursday, Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. can play around with the experimental research prototype, which is powered by a combination of Google’s latest world model Genie 3, its image-generation model Nano Banana Pro, and Gemini.

Coming five months after Genie 3’s research preview, the move is part of a broader push to gather user feedback and training data as DeepMind races to develop more capable world models.

World models are AI systems that generate an internal representation of an environment, and can be used to predict future outcomes and plan actions. Many AI leaders, including those at DeepMind, believe world models are a crucial step to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). But in the nearer term, labs like DeepMind envision a go-to-market plan that starts with video games and other forms of entertainment and branches out into training embodied agents (aka robots) in simulation.

DeepMind’s release of Project Genie comes as the world model race is beginning to heat up. Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs late last year released its first commercial product called Marble. Runway, the AI video-generation startup, has also launched a world model recently. And former Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun’s startup AMI Labs will also focus on developing world models.

“I think it’s exciting to be in a place where we can have more people access it and give us feedback,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, told TechCrunch via video interview, smiling ear-to-ear in clear excitement over Project Genie’s release.

DeepMind researchers that TechCrunch spoke to were upfront about the tool’s experimental nature. It can be inconsistent, sometimes impressively generating playable worlds, other times producing baffling results that miss the mark. Here’s how it works.

You start with a “world sketch” by providing text prompts for both the environment and a main character, whom you will later be able to maneuver through the world in either first- or third-person view. Nano Banana Pro creates an image based on the prompts that you can, in theory, modify before Genie uses the image as a jumping off point for an interactive world. The modifications mostly worked, but the model occasionally stumbled and would give you purple hair when you asked for green.

You can also use real-life photos as a baseline for the model to build a world on, which, again, was hit or miss. (More on that later.)

Once you’re satisfied with the image, it takes a few seconds for Project Genie to create an explorable world. You can also remix existing worlds into new interpretations by building on top of their prompts, or explore curated worlds in the gallery or via the randomizer tool for inspiration. You can then download videos of the world you just explored.

DeepMind is only granting 60 seconds of world generation and navigation at the moment, in part due to the budget and compute constraints. Because Genie 3 is an auto-regressive model, it takes a lot of dedicated compute — which puts a tight ceiling on how much DeepMind is able to provide to users.

“The reason we limit it to 60 seconds is because we wanted to bring it to more users,” Fruchter said. “Basically when you’re using it, there’s a chip somewhere that’s only yours and it’s being dedicated to your session.”

He added that extending it beyond 60 seconds would diminish the incremental value of the testing.

“The environments are interesting, but at some point, because of their level of interaction the dynamism of the environment is somewhat limited. Still, we see that as a limitation we hope to improve on.”

When I used the model, the safety guardrails were already up and running. I couldn’t generate anything resembling nudity, nor could I generate worlds that even remotely sniffed of Disney or other copyrighted material. (In December, Disney hit Google with a cease-and-desist, accusing the firm’s AI models of copyright infringement by training on Disney’s characters and IP and generating unauthorized content, among other things.) I couldn’t even get Genie to generate worlds of mermaids exploring underwater fantasy lands or ice queens in their wintery castles.

Still, the demo was deeply impressive. The first world I built was an attempt to live out a small childhood fantasy, in which I could explore a castle in the clouds made up of marshmallows with a chocolate sauce river and trees made of candy. (Yes, I was a chubby kid.) I asked the model to do it in claymation style, and it delivered a whimsical world that childhood me would have eaten up; the castle’s pastel-and-white colored spires and turrets looking puffy and tasty enough to rip off a chunk and dunk into the chocolate moat. (Video above.)

That said, Project Genie still has some kinks to work out.

The models excelled at creating worlds based on artistic prompts, like using watercolors, anime style, or classic cartoon aesthetics. But it tended to fail when it came to photorealistic or cinematic worlds, often coming out looking like a video game rather than real people in a real setting.

It also didn’t always respond well when given real photos to work with. When I gave it a photo of my office and asked it to create a world based on the photo exactly as it was, it gave me a world that had some of the same furnishings of my office — a wooden desk, plants, a grey couch — laid out differently. And it looked sterile, digital, not lifelike.

When I fed it a photo of my desk with a stuffed toy, Project Genie animated the toy navigating the space, and even had other objects occasionally react as it moved past them.

That interactivity is something DeepMind is working on improving. There were several occasions when my characters walked right through walls or other solid objects.

When DeepMind released Genie 3 initially, researchers highlighted how the model’s auto-regressive architecture meant that it could remember what it had generated, so I wanted to test that by returning to parts of the environment it generated already to see if it would be the same. For the most part, the model succeeded. In one case, I generated a cat exploring yet another desk, and only once when I turned back to the right side of the desk did the model generate a second mug.

The part I found most frustrating was the way you navigated the space using the arrows to look around, the spacebar to jump or ascend, and the W-A-S-D keys to move. I’m not a gamer, so this didn’t come naturally to me, but the keys were often non-responsive, or they sent you in the wrong direction. Trying to walk from one side of the room to a doorway on the other side often became a chaotic zigzagging exercise, like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel.

Fruchter assured me that his team was aware of these shortcomings, reminding me again that Project Genie is an experimental prototype. In the future, he said, the team hopes to enhance the realism and improve interaction capabilities, including giving users more control over actions and environments.

“We don’t think about [Project Genie] as an end-to-end product that people can go back to everyday, but we think there is already a glimpse of something that’s interesting and unique and can’t be done in another way,” he said.

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s “useless” satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that one of the first American protest songs was “Yankee Doodle”? In 1755, a British doctor put new words to a popular tune, mocking the American colonists as “doodles,” or simpletons, and “dandies,” or fops.

Once war broke out, British fighters taunted their American opposition with the song, but as the tide shifted, the Americans embraced it and began belting it back with proud defiance. And in 1781, when the British surrendered at Yorktown, some witnesses reported that the moment was set to the music of “Yankee Doodle.”

And by the way, did you know that the United States spent only $10,000 on the last land that it outright purchased? In 1944, the country bought Water Island, 500 volcanic acres in the Caribbean just south of St. Thomas; it had purchased the Virgin Islands (including St. Thomas) from Denmark a few decades earlier.

Water Island was not then owned by Denmark, but rather the Danish East Asiatic Company. By World War II, the United States wanted Water Island too, to support military operations on St. Thomas, so it scooped up the land for a bargain.

This, however, was not the last time the United States tried to purchase land, and not even that decade. Two years after the Water Island purchase, the Truman administration offered Denmark $100 million in gold to buy … Greenland.

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

In 1915, former President Theodore Roosevelt criss-crossed the country as a champion of what he called “Americanism.” The concept was becoming commonplace in American discourse, marking a stand against what he referred to as “hyphenated Americanism.” The persistence of such identities—German American, Italian American, Jewish American—was for Roosevelt “the one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin,” creating a “tangle of squabbling nationalities.” “The foreign-born population of this country,” Roosevelt said, “must be an Americanized population—no other kind can fight the battles of America either in war or peace.”

In 1916, the writer Randolph S. Bourne offered a rejoinder in The Atlantic. In his essay, “Trans-national America,” Bourne wondered: If Americanization on the terms that Roosevelt and others had defined failed, what of it? Should immigrants not shape their own lives as they see fit? Should they deny their own cultures and identities? To be open to this sort of cultural diversity was not, Bourne wrote, “to admit the failure of Americanization. It is not to fear the failure of democracy. It is rather to urge us to an investigation of what Americanism may rightly mean.”

Bourne’s investigation came in the form of this essay, which is often glossed as a rejection of the “melting pot” ideal and an early statement on multiculturalism—long before that term was in circulation. But in its immediate context, “Trans-national America” was something more urgent. During a moment of rising xenophobia and growing war fever, it was a direct challenge to the orthodoxy that there was only one way to be an American.

The alarm about immigrants and their incomplete assimilation into American life was not new to the mid-1910s. The wave of arrivals that began in the last decades of the 19th century sparked a range of nativist and exclusionary movements—particularly against East Asians—and considerable anxiety about those deemed too alien to integrate into the culture. The prospect of American intervention in the First World War after 1914 turned alarm into panic about immigrants’ supposedly divided loyalties. Calling on Congress for defense appropriations at the end of 1915, President Woodrow Wilson lashed out at those immigrants “who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life.” “Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy,” he said, “must be crushed out.”

For Bourne, the mood was eerily redolent of what he’d seen in Germany when the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914. As he scrambled to leave the country at the end of a post-college European tour, he saw how quickly militarism could coalesce into conformity—and how easily people could forget their principles in the process. At home in 1916, Bourne watched as calls for military “preparedness” merged with hardening definitions of loyalty and belonging.

Bourne tendered “Trans-national America” to The Atlantic (which had published his early work) to persuade Americans that they were asking the wrong questions about identity and belonging. If the melting pot had failed and the hyphenated Americans remained hyphenated, this was so much the better in Bourne’s view. Stripping new arrivals of their cultures and identities and forcing them into an Anglo-Saxon mold that didn’t fit them couldn’t be called freedom. It wasn’t even terribly American, considering so much of what passed for Anglo-Saxon culture in the United States was rooted in what Bourne saw as cowering fealty to English practice and precedent.

“Trans-national America” offered what Bourne called “a higher ideal.” America represented, in his telling, “a unique sociological fabric” as a gathering of the world’s peoples. The country’s dynamism lay not in its uniformity but in its diversity. A capacious America could avoid the fate of an Old World embroiled in a brutal military conflict. “Living here in mutual toleration, freed from the age-long tangles of races, creeds, and dynasties,” Americans could work out what Bourne called “a federated ideal” in which people were “mingled, yet not homogeneous”—in which “they merge, but they do not fuse.” This was Bourne’s concept of “trans-nationality”: a cosmopolitan American identity that embraced the world, and America itself, rather than emulating what had come before. Why, Bourne wondered, would anyone reject such a vital national formation? The alternative—“the weary old nationalism,—belligerent, exclusive, inbreeding”—was on display in a Europe at war.

Although Bourne was not an immigrant himself, he knew what it was to be an outsider in a world that was wary of them. During his birth, an obstetrician’s forceps had deformed his face; when he was a young child, spinal tuberculosis had stunted his growth and curved his spine. Bourne moved through the world keenly aware of both his disability and his difference—to which he testified with incisive clarity in a September 1911 Atlantic essay. As an undergraduate at Columbia, Bourne came to feel at home and first glimpsed the possibility of his “higher ideal” in lively intellectual exchange. To argue, debate, and ultimately understand was the foundation of what Bourne called a “Beloved Community” rooted in respect for people’s ideas and individuality. The model of the college could be expanded to the country at large, a nation built on “intellectual sympathy” for “different cultural expressions.” Such a community, Bourne said, “will make understanding and not indignation its end. Such a sympathy will unite and not divide.”

But Bourne’s essay and ideas could not stem a tide that was becoming a torrent. The continued drift toward war would only further amplify the panic over immigration. Bourne called for national educational service as a means of advancing his vision of a beloved community on a national scale; others welcomed American intervention abroad, and the conscripted military service it would require, as the best means to “yank the hyphen” out of immigrants with supposedly split loyalties. The immediate future did not belong to Bourne but to those he wrote against. Bourne’s more strident anti-war writings after “Trans-national America” would get him blackballed from most mainstream publications. The broader xenophobia of the time was built into a series of laws restricting immigration, increased suppression of dissent, and the rise of a national Ku Klux Klan that appropriated “100 percent Americanism” as its slogan.

Mercifully, perhaps, Bourne was not around to see it. He died in 1918, a victim of the flu pandemic. Although never quite forgotten, Bourne’s ideas gained new currency in the 1960s; a reflection and anthology of his work was published in 1965—the same year the Immigration and Nationality Act reversed the restrictions that had been in place since the 1920s. At least for a little while, people were able to see, as Bourne did, that “it bespeaks poverty of imagination not to be thrilled at the incalculable potentialities of so novel a union of men.”</div>

            <h2>MAGA’s War on Empathy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/war-empathy-hillary-clinton/685809/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I first saw the video of the killing of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital, I immediately thought of the parable of the Good Samaritan. Federal agents shot Pretti after he tried to help a woman they had thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed. Jesus tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves and help those in need. “Do this and you will live,” he says. Not in Donald Trump’s America.

Americans have now seen with their own eyes the cost of President Trump’s abuse of power and disregard for the Constitution. Videos of the killing of Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents have exposed the lies of Trump-administration officials who were quick to smear the victims as “domestic terrorists.” Even Americans who have grown habituated to Trump’s excesses have been shaken by these killings and the reflexively cruel and dishonest response from the administration.

This crisis also reveals a deeper moral rot at the heart of Trump’s MAGA movement. Whatever you think about immigration policy, how can a person of conscience justify the lack of compassion and empathy for the victims in Minnesota, and for the families torn apart or hiding in fear, for the children separated from their parents or afraid to go to school?

That compassion is weak and cruelty is strong has become an article of MAGA faith. Trump and his allies believe that the more inhumane the treatment, the more likely it is to spread fear. That’s the goal of surging heavily armed federal forces into blue states such as Minnesota and Maine—street theater of the most dangerous kind. Other recent presidents, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, managed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants without turning American cities into battlegrounds or making a show of keeping children in cages.

“The cruelty is the point,” as The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer memorably put it during Trump’s first term. The savagery is a feature, not a bug. By contrast, as Serwer noted recently in these pages, the people of Minnesota have responded with an approach you could call “‘neighborism’—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from.” To my ears, that’s as Christian a value as it gets.

The glorification of cruelty and rejection of compassion don’t just shape the Trump administration’s policies. Those values are also at the core of Trump’s own character and worldview. And they have become a rallying cry for a cadre of hard-right “Christian influencers” who are waging a war on empathy.

Their twisted campaign validates Trump’s personal immorality and his administration’s cruelty. It marginalizes mainstream religious leaders who espouse traditional values that conflict with Trump’s behavior and agenda. And it threatens to pave the way for an extreme vision of Christian nationalism that seeks to replace democracy with theocracy in America.

The rejection of bedrock Christian values such as dignity, mercy, and compassion did not start with the crisis in Minnesota. The tone was set right at the beginning of this second Trump presidency. The day after taking the oath of office last January, Trump attended a prayer service at the National Cathedral. The Episcopal bishop of Washington, Mariann Edgar Budde, directed part of her sermon at the new president: “In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.” She spoke of children of immigrant families afraid that their parents would be taken away, refugees fleeing persecution, and young LGBTQ Americans who feared for their lives. It was an honest plea, suffused with the kind of love and generosity toward neighbors and strangers that Jesus taught.

Bishop Budde was immediately vilified. One Republican congressman said she “should be added to the deportation list.” The pastor and influencer Ben Garrett warned his followers, “This snake is God’s enemy and yours too. She hates God and His people. You need to properly hate in response.” The right-wing Christian podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey called the sermon “toxic empathy that is in complete opposition to God’s Word and in support of the most satanic, destructive ideas ever conjured up.” Toxic empathy! What an oxymoron. I don’t know if the phrase reflects moral blindness or moral bankruptcy, but either way it’s appalling.

This is certainly not what I was taught in Sunday school, not what my reading of the Bible teaches me, and not what I believe Jesus preached in his short time on Earth. Yes, I went to Sunday school. In fact, my mother taught Sunday school at our Methodist church in Park Ridge, Illinois. As an adult, I occasionally taught at our church in Little Rock, Arkansas. Some people—such as the Republican congressman who once called me the Antichrist—might find this surprising. (When I confronted him, he mumbled something about not having meant it. Trump later appointed him to his Cabinet.)

I’ve never been one to wear my faith on my sleeve, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important to me. Quite the opposite: My faith has sustained me, informed me, saved me, chided me, and challenged me. I don’t know who I would be or where I would have ended up without it. So I am not a disinterested observer here. I believe that Christians like me—and people of faith more generally—have a responsibility to stand up to the extremists who use religion to divide our society and undermine our democracy.

No less a religious authority than the late Pope Francis called out the Trump administration’s war on empathy. After Vice President Vance argued that Christians should be stingy with their love, prioritizing those close to us over strangers, he offered a rebuke. “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,” the pope noted, before urging everyone to read up on the Good Samaritan.

Luis Parrales: What the border-hawk Catholics get wrong

The contrast between traditional Christian morality and Trumpian amorality was particularly stark at the memorial service for the slain MAGA activist Charlie Kirk in September. Kirk’s widow, Erika, publicly forgave her husband’s killer. “I forgive him because it was what Christ did,” she said. “The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love and always love.”

It reminded me of the families of the victims of the Mother Emanuel Church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, nine Black worshippers were murdered at an evening Bible study by a young white man trying to start a race war. In court a few days later, one by one, grieving parents and siblings stood up and told the shooter, “I forgive you.”

Instead of being inspired by Erika Kirk’s grace, though, Trump rejected it. “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them,” he declared. He would not forgive his enemies. “I am sorry, Erika,” he said. So much for “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.”

With leadership like this, it’s no wonder that one survey found a quarter of Republicans and nearly 40 percent of Christian nationalists now agree that “empathy is a dangerous emotion that undermines our ability to set up a society that is guided by God’s truth.” MAGA rejects the teachings of Jesus to “love thy neighbor” and care for “the last, the least, and the lost.” It recognizes only a zero-sum war of all against all. The world may look gilded from the patio at Mar-a-Lago, but the MAGA view is fundamentally fearful and impoverished. MAGA sees a world of vengeance, scorn, and humiliation, and cannot imagine generosity or solidarity.

The whole exercise is suffused with barely disguised misogyny. The extremist pastor Joe Rigney wrote a book called Leadership and the Sin of Empathy. Rigney is an ally of the influential Christian nationalist Douglas Wilson, who thinks giving women the right to vote was a mistake and advocates turning the United States into a theocracy. (Would it shock you to know that Pete Hegseth is a big fan of Wilson’s?)

Rigney declared that Bishop Budde’s plea for mercy was “a reminder that feminism is a cancer that enables the politics of empathetic manipulation and victimhood that has plagued us in the era of wokeness.” Manipulation by wily women is a sexist trope as old as Adam and Eve, but this is an ugly new twist. Instead of women tempting men with vice, now the great fear is that women will tempt men with virtue.

Christian nationalism—the belief that God has called certain Christians to exercise dominion over every aspect of American life, with no separation between Church and state—is ascendant in Trump’s Washington. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, displays a historic flag outside his office on Capitol Hill that in recent years has been embraced by Christian nationalists. The same flag was carried by insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, and flown by Justice Samuel Alito’s wife at the couple’s vacation home.

The National Council of Churches, the largest ecumenical organization for mainline churches in the country, has warned about the dangers of Christian nationalism. “In this quest for political power, Christian humility is lost, as is the message of God’s love for all humanity,” the council said in a 2021 statement. “Where the Bible has at its core the story of a people committed to welcoming aliens and strangers because they themselves were aliens and strangers, and to defending the oppressed because they themselves were once oppressed, the Christian nationalist narrative rejects the stranger and judges the oppressed as deserving of their oppression.”

This is exactly the kind of mainstream Christian view that enrages Allie Beth Stuckey. The author of Toxic Empathy, who styles herself a voice for Christian women, has more than a million followers on social media. In between lifestyle pitter-patter and her demonization of IVF treatments, she warns women not to listen to their soft hearts. This commissar of MAGA morality targets other evangelicals whose empathy, she warns, has left them open to manipulation. Maybe they recognize the humanity of an undocumented immigrant family and decide that mass deportation has gone too far. Or they make space in their heart for a young rape survivor forced to carry a pregnancy to term and start questioning the wisdom and morality of total abortion bans. It’s all toxic to Stuckey.

The don’t-love-thy-neighbor Christians have powerful allies in the war on empathy. Silicon Valley techno-authoritarians and social Darwinists argue that empathy is weakness and “suicidal” for civilization because it gets in the way of ruthless ambition and efficiency. That’s pretty rich for the crew that’s busy building artificial-intelligence systems they freely admit might obliterate humanity one day. But these are the same billionaires who dismiss critics and liberals as “NPCs,” or non-player characters, a video-game term for nonhumans. Once you see people that way, why would you care about understanding or helping them?

Elizabeth Bruenig: The conservative attack on empathy

They may be convinced that they’re the smartest guys in the room, but they’re dead wrong about this. Empathy won’t destroy civilization; indeed, it just might save it. We can debate policies. We can debate theology. But if we give up on empathy, we give up on any real chance of coming together to solve our problems. Empathy does not overwhelm our critical thinking or blind us to moral clarity. It opens our eyes to moral complexity. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a source of strength.

This might be lost on tycoons who have a huge financial interest in leaving the rest of us behind on their way to Mars, but one might hope Christians would know better. You don’t need to look too far back to find examples of those who do. I disagreed with President George W. Bush about many things, but I respected his sincere belief in a more “compassionate conservatism.” There was no greater proof of this commitment than the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a mission of mercy that helped save an estimated 26 million lives. It was a public-health miracle. Many of the program’s most ardent champions were evangelical Christians inspired by Jesus’s teachings to heal the sick and feed the hungry. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from slashing PEPFAR and other lifesaving assistance to people in need around the world. Experts predict that 14 million people could die by 2030 as a result—including millions of children.

Some earlier leaders of the religious right were also cruel and demagogic. When I was coming up in politics, we had huckster televangelists instead of social-media snake-oil salesmen, but the game was the same: exploit religion to profiteer and push an extreme political agenda. In the 1980s, right-wing firebrands such as Jerry Falwell and Anita Bryant claimed that the AIDS epidemic was a plague sent by God to punish gay people. There was no shortage of rhetoric that I would call dehumanizing or un-Christian. These reactionary religious forces led a decades-long campaign against women’s rights and gay rights that helped turn the Republican Party against democracy itself. The rise of unabashed Christian nationalists is their legacy.

But what we’re seeing today feels different—and more dangerous. The question of who deserves empathy, and the rights and respect that flow from our shared humanity, has always been highly contested in our politics. But until now, no major American political movement has ever seriously suggested that empathy and compassion themselves are suspect.

The decline of mainstream Christian voices in recent decades left a vacuum that the most extreme ideologues and provocateurs eagerly filled. The Catholic Church and the old mainline Protestant denominations have been weakened by destabilizing scandals and schisms, and have seen declining attendance. With the percentage of Americans identifying as Christian hitting record lows, the National Council of Churches expects that as many as 100,000 churches across the country will close in the coming years, mostly mainstream Methodist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran congregations.

It has pained me to see my own United Methodist Church split by deep disagreements over gay rights. Many conservative American congregations seceded and joined with traditionalist congregations in Africa and elsewhere to form a separate, less inclusive Church. Other denominations have faced similar struggles. All of this has left room for upstarts such as Douglas Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, a growing network of more than 150 Christian-nationalist congregations.

Another factor is Trump himself. No one mistakes him for a devout Christian or a person of faith or morality. But his corruption isn’t just a personal matter—it taints everything he touches, including his Christian supporters. The conventional wisdom is that Trump says out loud what many others think privately, that his blunt bigotry gives permission for people to throw off the shackles of political correctness and woke piety. That may be partly true. He does bring out the worst in people. But it’s more than that. He makes people worse. Cruelty and ugliness are infectious. When they become the norm, we all suffer.

Consider the contrast between Trump and Reagan, two presidents beloved by the religious right. Reagan offered a vision of an optimistic, sunny, welcoming America. He called it a shining city on a hill. His policies often failed to match his rhetoric, but the stories we tell ourselves matter. They shape our national narrative and shared moral framework. By contrast, Trump’s story is dark and angry, filled with “American carnage” in the streets. It makes sense that his political movement—and its version of Christianity—would be dark and angry, too.

Reagan cultivated a distinctly American mythos: the aw-shucks cowboy working his ranch and standing up to tyranny. Trump, especially in this second term, has styled himself as a gold-plated Caesar, the farthest thing from an American ideal. Instead of the decency of Washington we get the decadence of Caligula; rather than the humility of Lincoln, the cruelty of Nero. You’d think good Christians would see the irony of throwing their lot in with a wannabe Roman emperor, but the whole point of a cult of personality is to leave you blind and afraid.

Finally, I am convinced that the uniquely pernicious dynamics of social media have put all of these trends on steroids. Our addiction to algorithms has made society more lonely, anxious, and mean. Platforms like TikTok and Elon Musk’s X reward extremism and marginalize moderation. They promote negativity and smother positivity. Empathy doesn’t drive engagement, so it’s not valuable.

In the 1980s, I was impressed by Neil Postman’s book Amusing Ourselves to Death, which argued that television was corroding American society and democracy. He bemoaned how religion and politics had been reduced to shallow entertainment as a distracted public lost the ability to think clearly and debate rationally.

Today I find Postman’s warnings eerily prescient. He argued that “each medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.” Now that social media—and short-form, algorithmic video in particular—has taken over the world, it’s crucial that we understand how this medium is shaping our culture. It’s no coincidence that TikTok has given such a boost to far-right politics. It’s not just the hidden hand of the Chinese Communist Party, or the group of Trump supporters who recently bought the app’s American shell, although that’s also alarming. It’s that the medium is designed to boost vitriol and knee-jerk reactions rather than thoughtful dialogue. It provides fertile ground for misinformation and is inhospitable to serious journalism or debate.

Cultural critics have begun warning that we are at risk of becoming a “post-literate” society. They point to declining reading and math scores across the Western world in the years since the smartphone was introduced. The fear is that with fewer people reading books and newspapers, we’ll lose the ability to process complex ideas and arguments, become more susceptible to propaganda, and, to paraphrase Postman, scroll our way to oblivion.

There’s good reason to believe that a post-literate society will also be a post-moral society. We already have Christian influencers saying empathy is a sin. We have a president who is allergic to civic virtue. Americans spend countless hours on social media and are lonelier, angrier, and more distrustful than at any time I can remember.

A good place to start is to follow the example of courageous faith leaders standing up to the Trump administration’s abuses. On January 23, about 100 clergy were arrested after protesting deportation flights at the Minneapolis airport. They prayed and sang hymns in the brutal cold until police took them away. Many more have fanned out across the city to support protesters and help immigrant families in need.

David Brooks: America needs a mass movement—now

In November, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released an unusual special message condemning “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and “the vilification of immigrants.” It is rare for America’s bishops to speak with one voice like this—the last time was in 2013—but they said, “We feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.”

I hope grassroots faith leaders across the country who are appalled by what they see from an immoral administration and an extremist political right also find their voice. It is understandable that some stay silent out of fear. Influencers like Stuckey are zealously policing any deviation from the party line. But speaking truth to power has been part of the Christian tradition since the very beginning. The Christian community—and the country—would be stronger and healthier if we heard these voices.

We also need to contest this ground politically. If MAGA Republicans are going to give up on traditional virtues such as compassion and community, Democrats have an opportunity to fill that gap. The violent overreach in Minnesota may provide an opening to engage new audiences looking for alternatives. Many evangelical Christians who have long voted Republican are turned off by Trump’s venality and cruelty. Even some Republican leaders are starting to question the administration’s berserk immigration crackdown.

Democrats need a big tent that welcomes people of faith into our coalition, even if we don’t agree on every issue. Don’t forget, liberal Christianity has a long and storied history. Progressive people of faith have led virtually every major social movement. Think of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marching with Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel in Selma. That’s a spirit we should work to reclaim.

Indeed, welcoming is not enough. Democrats should actively reach out to people of faith and try to win their trust and their votes. That dozens of liberal clergy have already signed up to run for office in the 2026 midterms is an encouraging sign. This doesn’t mean Democrats should abandon our commitments to freedom, justice, and equality for all, or fight any less hard for what we believe in. We should listen with an open heart and an open mind, and be unafraid to talk about our values.

I know empathy isn’t easy. But neither is Christianity. When Jesus called on us to turn the other cheek and pray for those who persecute us, it was supposed to be hard. We fail more than we succeed—we’re human—but the discipline is to keep trying.

It’s especially challenging to feel empathetic for people with whom we disagree passionately. I certainly struggle with this. You may remember that I once described half of Trump supporters as “the basket of deplorables.” I was talking about people drawn to racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia—you name it. “Some of those folks, they are irredeemable,” I said. I still believe intolerance and hatred are deplorable. Slandering a peaceful protester and cheering his murder is deplorable. Terrorizing children because their parents are undocumented is deplorable. But as a Christian, I also aspire to see the goodness in everyone and believe that everyone has a chance at redemption, no matter how remote.

When I see brutality like we’ve all witnessed in Minnesota, I ask myself: Can I really find empathy for people who insist on dehumanizing others? I’m not sure, to be honest. I’m still working on it. I believe our hearts are big enough to hold two truths at once. We can see the humanity in even the worst of our fellow human beings and still fiercely resist tyranny and repression. We can stand firm without mirroring the cruelty of our opponents. These are dark days in America. To rekindle our light, we must reject cruelty and corruption. To be strong, we need more empathy, not less.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first few strums of Bruce Springsteen’s new song make you feel like you’re in for, well, a Bruce Springsteen song—a rollicking sing-along about rough-and-tumble but ultimately hopeful times in some troubled American town. And this song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” is exactly that.

It’s also a response to ICE’s bloody record in Minneapolis. It excoriates, by name, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, and “Trump’s federal thugs.” It memorializes Alex Pretti and Renee Good—the Americans killed by federal agents—and the “whistles and phones” still in use by demonstrators. The song’s considerable power lies in the way it transposes a classic, even hoary, mode of protest rock into the present. Springsteen conveys that we’re living through a time that will be sung about for years to come, and that the future depends a lot on what we do in this moment.

Springsteen has made many protest songs: the inequality elegy of “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” the post-9/11 rallying cry of “The Rising,” the Vietnam-veteran anthem “Born in the U.S.A.” As a reaction to law-enforcement overreach, “Minneapolis” especially recalls Springsteen’s 2000 song “American Skin (41 Shots),” about the police killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Black man. And across his catalog, Springsteen’s concrete lyricism and drawling vocals channel folk music’s titans of protest, Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. Here, those influences are worn proudly, ringing out in a buoyant harmonica solo.

But the song that “Minneapolis” most evokes is Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 touchstone, “Ohio,” recorded after the National Guard killed four students during a protest at Kent State University. “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,” sang Neil Young in a scene-setting verse; “King Trump’s private army from the DHS,” sings Springsteen now. Here we are again, late in a culture war, with a champion of a supposed silent majority breaking norms and pushing polarization. Here we are again as armed agents menace civilians. “Ohio” crystallized a moment that had already captured national attention, but it also invited listeners to suss out where they stand. “What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground?” Young asked. “How can you run when you know?”

“Streets of Minneapolis” doesn’t bother with questions. Its mission is to rouse in the manner of drinking songs, which its sloping melodies and gang-sung harmonies evoke. Springsteen has sounded bitter before, and mournful, but never this purely angry. His voice slithers and spits, reserving extra phlegm for the names of Donald Trump and his allies. Grace and warmth peek out in strategic moments as well, like the chorus’s oh-so-slowly intoned slant rhymes: the words Minneapolis, stranger in our midst, and—the poignance of this one took a moment to understand—26.

Twenty-six as in 2026: the exotic-sounding name of this new year in a decade that remains baffling more than halfway through. Who expected to be living this far in the future and yet trapped in the same old story? One can trace Minneapolis back not only to Kent State but also to the civil-rights movement, and to the labor riots and fascist takeovers abroad that inspired Guthrie. The details change, but the fundamental shape of the struggle remains stubbornly familiar: On one side, gun-toting agents of the establishment; on the other, advocates for the freedom of the less powerful. The clashes result in deaths that get called “senseless” but take on enduring symbolic weight thanks to songs just like this one.

Read: What Hollywood gets wrong about Springsteen

To be clear, “Minneapolis” is not “Ohio,” a paradigm-pushing masterpiece. Springsteen’s language—“thugs,” “King Trump,” “they trample on our rights”—is more Facebook post than poetry. The wordplay about fire and ice and ICE is cheap. The music is heavy-footed and formulaic. The immediate acclaim for it makes the critic in me a little resentful: Artists of all kinds routinely make songs engaging with their times, but so often these days, prestige is reserved for the music that copies the Boomers’ glory days. However, as this song suggests, that era shines in the public memory for a reason.

After sitting with “Streets of Minneapolis,” I tried again to get into Jesse Welles, a 33-year-old folk singer who makes scathingly anti-Trump songs with titles such as “Join ICE” and “No Kings.” Musically, he imitates Dylan and Springsteen to the point of parody. The way the media and rock institutions have embraced him—he’s played Stephen Colbert, performed with Joan Baez, and is up for four Grammys this year—implies that he is the great hope for musical resistance, but his blend of modern buzzwords with Woodstock aesthetics has struck my ear as injuriously hokey.

This Springsteen song has changed my ear a bit. I’m starting to hear Welles and other singers like him—we’re in a bit of a boom for conscientious folk rock—a little more generously. That they’re singing at all, and that anyone is listening, really does matter. Culture, we all know, has become fractured. The easiest way for Trump to get everything he wants is for his opponents to fail to speak in a unified voice. Thinking back to the last time such unity seemed possible isn’t nostalgic—it’s practical.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The events in Minneapolis, especially the horrifying killing of two Americans, reconfirmed one awful thing and taught us two encouraging things.

What was reconfirmed was the sheer malevolence and cruelty of the Trump administration. It encouraged federal agents to act lawlessly and in ways that led to an innocent woman, Renee Good, being shot, including in the head at point-blank range, and an innocent man, Alex Pretti, being shot 10 times within five seconds, according to forensic experts. Pretti was on his knees, restrained, posing no apparent threat, when he was riddled with bullets.

What makes things even worse is that after the innocent were gunned down, administration officials hit the airwaves to slander the dead, accusing them of acts of “domestic terrorism” and, in Pretti’s case, of being a “would-be assassin,” in the words of the president’s most influential aide, Stephen Miller.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: Tim Walz fears a Fort Sumter moment in Minneapolis

These grotesque lies brought additional, immense pain to grieving families and friends. The Pretti family called the government’s lies “sickening” and “reprehensible.” And those lies forced people who loved Pretti to tell about the man they knew—a “kindhearted soul,” in the words of his parents; a beloved mentor and a calm presence; caring toward young friends and colleagues; diligent and respectful; a great listener who had an easy smile.

“We just really wanted to be like him, because he was cool without trying,” J. D. Atkins, who described Pretti as a role model to younger students, told The New York Times. “And as an adult I realize, it’s because he was kind to everybody.”

“He cared about people,” Pretti’s friend Heather Zielinski told NPR. “He was just living a good life.”

BUT FROM THESE AWFUL, SEARING MOMENTS in Minneapolis, we have learned a couple of encouraging things. The first is that in this instance, the Trump administration’s effort to gaslight the public failed. So often it has succeeded, at least with vast swaths of the county. The most obvious examples are the violent assault on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Donald Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, but there are dozens more.

The administration’s massive, multifront, round-the-clock assault on truth is perhaps the greatest danger it poses. So the fact that it failed in this case is no small thing; the administration is in retreat, reportedly frustrated more with the coverage of events than with the killings themselves.

Trump, perhaps sensing that promulgating Orwellian lies wouldn’t be easy, given what happened in Minneapolis, didn’t spend his time promoting them. He left that to his subordinates, who have much less standing with his supporters.

Still, 10 years into the Trump era, to see the administration abjectly fail to psychologically manipulate the citizenry—to brazenly deceive and brainwash, to claim that black is white and justice is injustice—is somewhat reassuring. In this case, it took multiple videos of the execution-like killings. But I’ll take progress where I can find it.

The second thing we saw is that peaceful mass protests inspired by a sense of justice can succeed. Mobilization works. In this instance, the protests were combined with citizen surveillance of marauding federal agents, primarily through the use of smartphone recordings. It served “a kind of double purpose,” Charles Homans wrote in the Times: “capturing evidence and also capturing the narrative, showing the world what Trump’s immigration crackdown looked like in practice.”

Minneapolitans also distributed whistles to alert people to ICE’s whereabouts. We’re seeing a stirring example of what my colleague Adam Serwer calls “neighborism—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from,” whether they were born in Minneapolis or Mogadishu.

What the good and brave patriots of Minneapolis, and those who traveled to Minneapolis to express solidarity, are demonstrating is, in Serwer’s words, “a real resistance, broad and organized and overwhelmingly nonviolent, the kind of movement that emerges only under sustained attacks by an oppressive state. Tens of thousands of volunteers—at the very least—are risking their safety to defend their neighbors and their freedom.”

Because what Minneapolitans have done has worked, others will learn from it. The feeling of powerlessness that so many Americans have struggled with during Trump’s second term is giving way to a sense of greater agency. Americans are not merely corks in Trump’s raging ocean. Courage inspires courage. Success inspires imitation. Living in truth; cultivating the sphere of truth; joining together to stand for truth and against intimidation, repression, and state-sanctioned violence—all of this still matters.

“The historical record clearly shows,” Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan wrote in Why Civil Resistance Works, “that civil resistance is an enduring force for change.” The authors point out that when it’s done right, it can lead to shifts in loyalty even among erstwhile supporters of repressive regimes, including members of the military. Not everyone is beyond reach.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

We’ve learned a third lesson as well: What has to precede depolarization is resolute defiance of attempts to violate America’s core ideals. Efforts to bridge partisan divides are admirable, and we’ve seen success here and there. But they aren’t enough, and in some ways, they deny an important reality: The Trump coalition isn’t interested in decreasing polarization or increasing mutual understanding. That isn’t surprising, because Trump himself is the most divisive, vengeance-driven president in American history. His supporters take their cues from him.

The first order of business, then, is to effectively resist and then defeat Trump and the MAGA movement. The rest can follow from that. Defeating Trump should be done with integrity, without violence, and without deploying dehumanizing tactics. But right now, given the dark passions that have been unleashed within MAGA and the leader of the movement, who stokes those passions several times each day, the chances of large-scale depolarization are vanishingly small.

We have seen, time and time again, that the MAGA movement is rooted in pulsating resentments and overpowering hatreds, even in evangelical- and fundamentalist-Christian communities, where one might hope to find the “ministry of reconciliation” alive and well. But friends of mine who are pastors privately admit that ugliness has found a home in the hearts of many of those who claim to be followers of Jesus. And many of those ministers don’t know what to do about it.

We cannot implant a generosity of spirit or a desire for civic comity in those who see such things as weaknesses. Isaiah’s injunction—“Come now, and let us reason together”—doesn’t always apply when emotions are inflamed. That doesn’t mean that one day it won’t, or even that in individual cases it can’t. But we cannot make the wish the father of the thought.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, which is rightly held up as an example of how to heal a society, succeeded, but only after the apartheid government was defeated, not before. The moral appeals of Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu didn’t move the hearts of the apartheid regime or many of its supporters until they had lost power.

We need to be realistic. We still have three years left in Trump’s second term, and his descent into madness will continue.

My brother—a retired police captain with 35 years’ experience who is looking at all of this with horror—told me that he sees sending a politicized ICE force and the National Guard into our cities uninvited as part of a bigger scheme. Trump believes that keeping immigration at the top of the agenda helps him portray himself as a strong and tough president. But my brother said he fears even more an attempt to normalize in the minds of the general public the presence of federal agents and military personnel on our streets.

George Packer: What should Americans do now?

The withdrawal of some agents from Minneapolis could signal a tactical retreat. But even if it is, we shouldn’t lose sight of the larger picture. What happened in Minneapolis is important and won’t be forgotten. We have the beginnings of a road map to help us withstand the Trump assault.

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN is one of the great storytellers of the American journey. Many of his songs are powerful and poetic, at times indicting and at times comforting.

Yesterday, Springsteen released “Streets of Minneapolis,” which he dedicated to “the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors,” and the “memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.”

We’ll remember the names of those who died

Alex Pretti and Renee Good died too young, standing against too much injustice. There is honor in how they died, just as there is dishonor and disgrace in those who killed them—those who pulled the trigger and those who empowered them to pull the trigger. What more becomes of the legacies of Pretti and Good, whether their deaths inspire others to push back the darkness, depends on the rest of us.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/2026/01/atlantic-hires-david-brooks-staff-writer/685806/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Atlantic is announcing that David Brooks, who for years has contributed memorable Atlantic cover stories and essays on political and societal issues, is joining the magazine as a staff writer beginning next month. The Atlantic will be the home for all of David’s writing, and he will also host a new weekly video podcast that will launch later this spring. David worked as an opinion columnist at The New York Times for 22 years.

In a note to staff, The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, writes: “David’s work––his columns, his stories for us, and his many books––have made him known and acclaimed around the world. He is, among other things, America’s best pop sociologist, someone with a reporter’s curiosity and a writer’s grace. He is an unparalleled diagnostician of the faults and weaknesses of governments, institutions, and social structures, as our readers know from such stories as “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake,” “Confessions of a Republican Exile,” and “How the Ivy League Broke America.”

The forthcoming podcast will explore the moral, social, and philosophical underpinnings of human decency—with a particular focus on the role that institutions play in shaping communities and ideologies. The podcast is produced by The Atlantic and made possible by support from Yale University, which is also announcing today that David will be a presidential senior fellow at Yale University’s School of Global Affairs.

The Atlantic has been rapidly growing its podcast network, and this new video podcast will be the fourth to launch in the past 12 months. Last year, The Atlantic launched Galaxy Brain with Charlie Warzel and The David Frum Show, and is developing a new show with Adam Harris. The third season of Autocracy in America with Anne Applebaum is out now; The Atlantic’s flagship show is Radio Atlantic, hosted by Hanna Rosin.

I don&#39;t believe Microsoft understands fully what would be &quot;meaningful&quot; to their customers. How about removing the Microsoft account requirement, removing the telemetry, removing the ads, removing the AI, removing the cloud integration, removing the bloat? How about giving customers real control, like being able to turn off updates. That would be meaningful.Yeah, they&#39;re not going to stop shoveling AI and &quot;give us all your data&quot; initiatives. And while I have no outright proof, I have to think the data-suck and honestly too-fast addition of AI features is leading to a lot of the instability issues we&#39;ve been hearing about. I&#39;ve found that if I keep networking completely turned off I get much better performance on local-only tasks. Even without opening an email client or a web browser but leaving the network adapter turned on I see CPU and RAM usage climb fairly

Windows 2000 was good for its time.  I would love a version of Windows 2000 with an up-to-date security model.

Sorry, too late. The trust was killed by MS a long time ago and I don&#39;t think they can get it back. I&#39;ve pretty much weaned myself off of MS products at home; the last remaining one is Onenote which I use via the web interface and even there I&#39;m slowly pulling the information off and deleting notebooks.

I only use Windows when forced to at work, and even then, I do my best to live in the WSL world. I&#39;ve got some time left before I retire, but I&#39;m really looking forward to retirement and ending the MS world.

So more people moves to better operating systems.

Maybe they can swarm and suggest some Linux distros to move to.

&#39;Microsoft wants you to know that it knows that Windows 11, now used by a billion users, has been testing your patience and announced that its engineers are being redirected to urgently address the operating system&#39;s performance and reliability problems through an internal process the company calls &quot;swarming.&quot;&#39;

&quot;Brooks&#39;s law is an observation about software project management that &quot;Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.&quot; (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org])

They can regain trust by removing the following:

1. Telemetry.
2. Advertising.
3. &quot;AI&quot;.
4. Mandatory Microsoft account.
5. Arbitrary restrictions on supported hardware (TPM, CPU age).

6.  Restore old utilities the way they were, such as Notepad, WordPad and Paint (without the AI)

7.  Give people the option of using past Windows user interfaces, even if they don&#39;t make it the default.  For instance, let one make Windows 11 or 12 look like Windows 7, if that&#39;s the look & feel one enjoys

8.  If they have to include a News app, give people the option of entering the websites of the news sources they trust, not the ones MS wants us to read

Probably, but Microsoft will re-enable it all with the next update.

We need to improve Windows in ways that are meaningful for peopleThat statement is clear, Windows is not a useful or meaningful, or usable operating system, across the board.  Microsoft is admitting this, Microsoft, how bad does a product have to be, for Microsoft to admit it&#39;s terrible?  If you need any more convincing that you can&#39;t utilize Windows as a professional, you&#39;re a fraud.  Not a confused, but understandable idiot, a fraud, no different from someone who takes money for a job, and disappears.  It&#39;s over, Windows is not a usable operating system, from Microsoft, not from the Unix and Linux community, from Microsoft.

Just be an operating system.  Focus on being better than that.Stop mining data.Stop trying to force people to connect to various services.Just let users run the software they choose to run and stay out of their way.

It isn&#39;t Windows that has the trust problem.  Look in the mirror Steve, er, I mean Satya.  It&#39;s gonna happen when you turn an operating system into an advertising, distraction, and surveillance platform (that still runs on the same deficient kernel that you ran in the year 2000).

1. Allow disabling automatic updates. Indefinitely.2. Allow disabling AI system-wide3. Kill all nagware / ads.4. Remove the Settings app and restore a proper, old-fashioned Control Panel.5. Restore full support for local-only accounts.6. Stop forcing hardware updates, such as TPM.7. Stop constantly resetting system settings on updates.8. Related to 7, stop resetting default apps / handlers.9. Decouple from the OS and allow users to fully uninstall Edge.10. Stop collecting all the bloody analytics.

They should have invested in extremely small violins.

The gambling/looting operations will not be missed.

This includes things like auto repair shops, dentists, veterinarians, home improvement contractors.

PE has been seeping into these businesses by buying out the owners.

A good way to tell if a company is PE-owned if they won&#39;t tell you is to look at their consumer contract.

Firms owned by PE extract as much from the customer as they legally can and leave no value on the table. Their contracts are full of binding arbitration, evergreening (automatic renewal) clauses, and short warranty periods.

The materials used by PE-owned businesses are sub-par as they cut their material costs to the bone. This explains the short warranty periods.

It&#39;s sickening how many &quot;local businesses&quot; they&#39;ve gotten their fangs into.  The first 3 HVAC companies I looked at for a new furnace here were backed by those parasites.  Finally found a smaller company that&#39;s still independent but it&#39;s getting harder and harder to find them.

Exactly what happened to my 2nd IT job.  Clipboard-bearing suits came and were shown everything.  2 months later I left.  2 months after that the announcement came that the company had been sold off to a PE firm.

That PE took a 50-year old, money-making medical firm (billing, staffing, etc) and promptly ran it into an iceberg.  After the carnage, it was sold yet again.. and one more time.

Now they exist in name only, a sub of a sub of a sub of some other company.

Getting bought out is almost universally undesi

Investing is gambling, just with a little more information about the game. Have you made bad bets and you don&#39;t want to sell at a loss? Well... Tough!

The smartest guys in the room somehow failed to realize that 40% compounded growth forever at 80%-3000% gross margins wasn&#39;t possible. It can happen for 5-10 years of an economic turnover (whether driven by new technology, new forms of organization, immigration, or other fundamental changes) but just because it happens to some organizations for 5, 10, even 20 years does not mean it can/will happen to every organization - and trees don&#39;t grow to the sky.

You may have to change jobs to get rid of those awful funds. The whole 401K thing is a closed garden racket.

Ever wonder why you can&#39;t invest in an IRA when your employer offers a 401K?

Ever wonder why the annual contribution limits for IRA&#39;s are much lower than 401K&#39;s?

Ever wonder why the owner of a small business can invest more in a &quot;Sole Proprietor&quot; IRA or SEP then an employee can if they work for a company who doesn&#39;t offer a 401K?

These rules are there because special interests were able to lobby for them

Seems like there is too much money out there.

Famously, they’ve been buying up residential homes and apartments at a torrid pace, with all the fun that will bring.

But they are also buying up small service firms like my plumber (and funeral homes, and insurance agencies, and medical/dental practices, and). My plumber probably has 100 employees. So, not tiny, but not huge, either. I knew the guy who started it. He sold out. I suppose I can’t blame him. First thing I notice next time I need help?  Hourly rates doubled.  Parts much more expensive.

I get these PE masters of the universe are going to buying and selling companies. It’s what they do. But can they stay off Main Street?

We will wake up 10 years from Now and none of the local businesses you use will be locally owned. I think that’s a bad thing.

Spare me any talk that they are providing some sort of efficiency service here. I bet my plumber’s business is well run. What they found was that they could charge a lot more for worse service. That’s all.

Time to find a new plumber.Once PE buys a home improvement contractor, they change the terms in the contract to extract all the value for themselves and leave nothing on the table for the consumer.

Read the contract before committing to any new business. The contract will almost tell you that a business is PE owned. It will have shitty terms for you and indemnify them.

Seems like there is too much money out there.Agreed. Seeing the eye-watering returns that some of the big, blue chip players made, you&#39;ve got a lot of people chasing after them. Problem is, the blue chip guys are able to get the best deals, and these smaller ones are having to rely upon riskier opportunities. No surprise them that they thus have more difficulty meeting their returns. I shed no tears - risk is an inherent part of capitalism. They made a risky bet with this midsized firms, so if, surprise, they don&#39;t make their money, then it&#39;s on them.

The optimistic story about the FBI’s surprising Wednesday raid on Fulton County, Georgia, voting offices to seize ballots and electronic materials related to the 2020 election is that it’s another instance of the United States Department of Justice and other parts of the federal government indulging in Donald Trump’s fantastical belief that he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden in 2020 because of fraud. If that reason for the raid is right, the investigation will amount to very little, even if Trump and allies mangle whatever evidence the FBI produces to continue spreading ridiculous voter fraud claims. If the government attempts to bring criminal charges (that may well be barred by the statute of limitations), they are far more likely to be about Trump’s retribution campaign than about actual intentional violations of federal law protecting the integrity of elections.

The pessimistic story is far darker. It’s about the raid being a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, when control of both houses of Congress could be at stake. Now is the time for state and local governments, the courts, and the people to work against such potential election subversion.

The Fulton County saga goes back to the hotly contested 2020 presidential election, which was conducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Donald Trump was an unpopular incumbent running against former Vice President Joe Biden. Many states made it easier for people to vote by mail in 2020, which was much safer than voting in person and potentially getting sick. Trump had long spread unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud, from massive noncitizen voting to fraud committed in large American cities like Philadelphia and Detroit that have substantial minority populations. But during 2020, Trump turned his propaganda machine on the influx of mail-in ballots, which he claimed would be infected by fraud; never mind that he regularly voted by mail in his home state of Florida.

Election results came in slowly, thanks in part to the slower count necessary to properly process the flood of mail-in ballots. When the numbers were released, Biden had won, including in Georgia, where he claimed victory by a slim margin. Trump tried various tactics to overturn that result and others. Before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from counting states’ Electoral College votes and declare Trump the winner—Trump leaned on election administrators and elected officials in states with majority-Republican legislatures to overturn the results. Even though Georgia had conducted a hand recount of all the state’s ballots that confirmed Biden’s victory, Trump notoriously pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes to flip the results to him. Raffensperger refused.

While Trump worked the refs, his allies worked the public, and much of the effort to gin up fraud claims focused on the processing of ballots in State Farm Arena by Fulton County election workers. Focusing on an area with a large population of Black voters was par for the course among Trump’s fraudulent fraud-squad members. Rudy Giuliani falsely accused two election workers there of fraud (as well as passing around drugs), and they faced threats and harassment; the workers, Wandrea Moss and her mother, Ruby Freedman, won a $148 million defamation suit against Giuliani, which later settled.

Fulton County, like many large counties in the United States, has seen its share of election administration mismanagement. But a yearslong investigation by state officials found no intentional wrongdoing and nothing that would have changed the 2020 outcome.

Given the deep investigations of the 2020 elections generally and Fulton County, Georgia, in particular, it is highly unlikely that the new FBI investigation (whose warrant was curiously sought by a U.S. attorney in Missouri, not Georgia or even Washington, D.C.) will amount to anything. So what was it really about?

One tipoff is the curious appearance during the FBI raid of Fulton County’s election offices of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who is known to peddle conspiracy theories herself. Portraying this raid as part of a national security effort is in line with the musings of Cleta Mitchell, a Trump conspiracy-theory ally who had been on Trump’s call with Raffensperger. Back in September, Mitchell, on a call with fellow election deniers, suggested that Trump could declare a “national sovereignty crisis” in a bid to take over the midterm elections.

Trump has no power over the conduct of federal elections, which are left in the hands of the states, a point numerous courts have made recently in striking down parts of an August Trump executive order purporting to make voting harder. But that doesn’t mean he won’t try. Trump has expressed regret that he did not seize voting machines in 2020. So this threat for 2026 (and 2028) is real.

So what can be done about all of this? To begin with, state and local election officials need to be ready to go to federal court to seek injunctions barring the government from seizing voting machines or otherwise interfering with the process of tabulating ballots. Trump might even try to send troops to seize ballots without a search warrant, and if that threat is real, proactive judicial action is necessary. These threats are most likely to materialize in those areas around the country with contested congressional races. Particular targets may be in those states, such as California and Arizona, where the tabulation of ballots takes a long time, so there is more time for Trump and his allies to act.

State officials and the public need to support, with dollars and volunteers, election administrators and those who would hold the line against interference. The greater the transparency of the work of these administrators in tabulating ballots, and the quicker a fair count can take place, the harder it will be for Trump to have a legal excuse to try to interfere with the balloting.

Donald Trump is not going to be able to cancel U.S. elections. But the events this week in Fulton County remind us that he has many tools at his disposal to try to mess with them. It’s not too early to plan against another attempt to overturn democratically conducted elections in the United States.

How do you stop someone from killing someone else? In most societies, we do so with warnings, promises, and contracts. We make laws to make ourselves feel safe. It’s important to feel safe, because reality is terrifying. In Minneapolis this weekend, we saw reality: a group of men with guns, in a semicircle, firing a barrage of shots into a man’s body lying on the ground. The laws that were supposed to protect Alex Pretti—the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, multiple state and local and national statutes on use of force—failed. Pretti’s death, captured on video from multiple angles, was so shocking that even the Trump administration has been forced to rethink its brutal tactics in the Twin Cities, which for more than a month has been ravaged by an onslaught of federal agents ostensibly conducting “immigration enforcement.”

Now, the Trump administration is shifting its approach, or at least its messaging. Gregory Bovino, the cartoonishly fascist figurehead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in the Twin Cities, has been removed from his post and forced off social media. Kristi Noem, Bovino’s boss at the Department of Homeland Security, received a brief, but significant, rebuke from the president. The Democrats, America’s sluggish and often ineffectual opposition party, are howling for investigations, firings, and impeachments.

It’s tempting to see these developments as a victory, as the rule of law slowly reasserting itself over a deadly aberration in America’s social contract. Soon, you might think, things may go back to normal. But in Donald Trump’s America, the contract has been rewritten. The conditions that caused Pretti’s death still exist—in Minneapolis, in Maine, in California, in every city and every town where agents of the state carry guns. The goon squads are here to stay, and it’s only a matter of time until they kill again.

What this reflects is more than the Trump administration’s vicious immigration policies, but a broader shift in American politics. Inside the West Wing, a terrifying new political ideology is on display, one that says the right to shape, change, and end Americans lives is not granted by a democratic framework of laws, but by a simple equation of who has more guns.

This shift was not immediate. During the first Trump administration, the snarl of legal jurisprudence that slowed down many of Trump’s most egregious excesses also lured us into a false sense of comfort that the law still worked, and that the contract still held—and sometimes it did. When Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election, the system worked. Judges threw out his cases. When rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were prosecuted en masse for their crimes. Trump himself was impeached, though never convicted, thanks to the cowardice of a bloc of Republican senators.

Upon entering his second term, Trump went for it, not so much testing as smashing through the constraints of legal precedent—he pardoned the criminals who stormed the Capitol on his behalf and indicted many of the officials that, in turn, had indicted him. On the border, he saw a chance to test his might: calling in Marines to quell protesters in Los Angeles and increasing the DHS’s purview to arrest, detain, and raid far outside of their preexisting jurisdictions.

The guardrails are not holding this time around.

Minneapolis represents the most stark example of the rule of the gun thus far. During “Operation Metro Storm,” the ominously named federal operation in the Twin Cities, federal agents have shot three people, killed two, and injured dozens with pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and fists. Until Pretti’s death finally tipped the scales, Noem and other figures in the administration doubled and tripled down on their mandate to use force. Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot Renee Good, the first person killed by ICE in the Twin Cities, currently faces no charges, after the FBI intervened to toss out the state-level investigation into the killing.

Federal agents have repeatedly violated protesters’ First Amendment rights, detained citizens and noncitizens alike unlawfully, and even sought to prevent detainees from accessing legal counsel. The Department of Justice, instead of investigating these abuses, has instead leveled charges on the protesters. There are videos all over social media of officers, after Good’s killing, taunting protesters with threats that they will be next. The men with guns knew the power they held. They knew no one could stop them from killing.

And so when Alex Pretti stood up in the middle of the street, filming them with his phone, and intervened to try to help another civilian they had pushed to the ground, they shot him. He had, after all, committed a crime in their eyes: He had resisted the administration’s will. The agents who killed Pretti have not been identified or charged; like in Good’s killing, there will be no federal civil rights investigation, only an internal process overseen by the department that fired the shots. (Two of the agents involved in shooting Pretti have now been put on leave, but that’s a far cry from meaningful consequences for what they did.) Even if, by some miracle, Good’s and Pretti’s killers are eventually brought to justice, their individual consequences do nothing to subvert ICE’s mandate of force wherever it appears. ICE can afford to discipline or lose an agent or two to mollify public opinion. They have plenty more operating, still, under the same rules of engagement.

Under Trump’s new government-by-gun, individuals are presented with a choice between obedience and execution—or at least the ever-present danger of it. And without legal recompense, the only check to this power appears to be other armed men.

In Maine, where ICE and other agencies have been conducting snatch-and-grab arrests and targeted harassment of protesters similar to those in Minneapolis, local law enforcement has already staked out a hard line against their excesses, something that Minneapolis’ authorities were slow to do. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce called ICE’s actions “bush-league policing” in an interview on Sunday, after federal agents mistakenly arrested a local corrections officer. This pressure has also changed the situation in Minneapolis, where Gov. Tim Walz has managed to muster a largely tepid show of force from his own military, the Minnesota National Guard, deploying them to the streets in cute reflective vests with donuts and coffee.

It’s easy to see those images and miss what they mean. The National Guard is often seen as a friendly force that shows up with bottled water during hurricanes and digs out roads after mudslides. But that’s not what they are: They are armed forces that are ostensibly under the command of a state governor. Their presence on the streets of Minneapolis, orange vests and all, is a show of force by a state military aligned opposite of a federal military. Right now, it’s no more than optics. But lines are being drawn.

And things could always get worse. The National Guard and domestic police are not sympathetic forces to many of this country’s marginalized groups. In L.A. and D.C., National Guard troops squared up with protesters themselves, and their orders come from political actors—governors, mayors, and other politicians with their own biases and agendas.

Soldiers and police, however, are not the only people in America who have guns. As the top levels of our political system wield violence in the open, it’s only a matter of time before people tired of having guns pointed at them may decide that it’s time to have more guns to point back. Communities I have reported on for years are beginning to mobilize again. Online, left-wing accounts and marginalized groups are openly championing the Second Amendment, abandoning arguments for reasonable gun control in favor of arming themselves to face a future in which their only defense is through open force. There was nothing to stop ICE agents from killing Alex Pretti, their thinking goes, so the next time it happens someone might as well shoot back. A brutal occupation unrestrained by any notion of fairness or recompense often inspires a violent response, which would plunge our society into circumstances it has rarely, if ever, seen before: widespread violence on the streets and guerilla attacks on federal forces that inspire even more brutal reprisals and repression.

It’s still possible to regain control of our society before we get to that point; to organize and protest and document well enough that a better future is made possible before the rule of the gun is all we have left. We’ve seen that approach have some success , in this specific case: The administration’s excesses were so blatant and cruel—and so highly publicized—that politicians on both sides of the aisle were forced to hold them to account. But so far, Trump’s response looks more like damage control than a larger shift in approach. The goon squads are still on the streets, still hauling people into their vans. They will learn from this defeat. They will get better at killing. And unless we find a way to upset the architects of our new political order, they’re almost certainly going to do it again.

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he worked with Vice President Kamala Harris, and he knows something about world politics.* The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Correction, Jan. 29, 2026: This post originally misstated that Banga advised Harris during her 2024 campaign.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Corporate use of AI agents in 2026 looks like the Wild West, with bots running amok and no one quite knowing what to do about it - especially when it comes to managing and securing their identities.

Organizations have been using identity security controls for decades to ensure only authorized human users access the appropriate resources to do their jobs, enforcing least-privilege principles and adopting zero-trust-style policies to limit data leaks and credential theft.

&quot;These new agentic identities are absolutely ungoverned,&quot; Shahar Tal, the CEO of agentic AI cybersecurity outfit Cyata, told The Register. Agentic identities are the accounts, tokens, and credentials assigned to AI agents so they can access corporate apps and data.

&quot;We&#39;re letting things happen right now that we would have never let happen with our human employees,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re letting thousands of interns run around in our production environment, and then we give them the keys to the kingdom. One of the key pain points that I hear from every company is that they don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening&quot; with their AI agents.

In part, this is by design. &quot;In the agentic AI world, the value proposition is: give us access to more of your corporate data, and we will do more work for you,&quot; Nudge Security co-founder and CEO Russell Spitler told The Register. &quot;Agents need to live inside the existing ecosystem of where that data lives, and that means that they need to live within the existing authentication and access infrastructure that SaaS providers already provide to access your data.&quot;

This means AI agents using OAuth tokens to access someone&#39;s Gmail or OneDrive containing corporate files, or repository access tokens to interact with a GitHub repo that holds source code.

We&#39;re letting things happen that we would have never let happen with our human employees

&quot;In order to provide value, agents need to get the data from the things that already have the data, and there are existing pathways to get that data,&quot; Spitler said.

Plus, the plethora of coding tools makes it super easy for individual employees to create AI agents, delegate access to their accounts and data, and then ask the agents to do certain jobs to make the humans&#39; lives easier.

Spitler calls this AI&#39;s &quot;hyper-consumerized consumption model.&quot;

&quot;Those two pieces are what gives rise to the challenges that people have from a security perspective,&quot; he said.

These challenges can lead to disastrous consequences, as researchers and red teams have repeatedly shown. For example, AI agents with broad access to sensitive data and systems can create a &quot;superuser&quot; that can chain together access to sensitive applications and resources, and then use that access to steal information or remotely execute malicious code.

As global education and training company Pearson&#39;s CTO Dave Treat recently noted: AI agents &quot;tend to want to please,&quot; and this presents a security problem when they are granted expansive access to highly sensitive corporate info.

&quot;How are we creating and tuning these agents to be suspicious and not be fooled by the same ploys and tactics that humans are fooled with?&quot; he asked.

Block discovered during an internal red-teaming exercise that its AI agent could be manipulated via prompt injection to deploy information-stealing malware on an employee laptop. The company says the issue has since been fixed.

These security risks aren&#39;t shrinking anytime soon. According to Gartner&#39;s estimates, 40 percent of all enterprise applications will integrate with task-specific AI agents by 2026, up from less than 5 percent in 2025.

Considering many companies today don&#39;t know how many AI agents have access to their apps and data, the challenges are significant.

Tal explains the first thing his company does with its customers is a discovery scan. &quot;And there is always this jaw-dropping moment when they realize the thousands of identities that are already out there,&quot; he said.

It&#39;s important to note: these are not only agentic identities but also human and machine identities. As of last spring, however, machine identities outnumber human identities by a ratio of 82 to one.

When Cyata scans corporate environments, &quot;we are seeing anywhere from one agent per employee to 17 per employee,&quot; Tal said. While some roles - specifically research and development and engineering - tend to adopt AI agents more quickly than the rest of their companies, &quot;folks are adopting agents very, very quickly, and it&#39;s happening all across the organization.&quot;

This is causing an identity crisis of sorts, and neither Tal nor the other AI security folks The Register spoke to for this story believe that agentic identities should be included in the larger machine identities counts. AI agents are dynamic and context-aware - in other words, they act more like humans than machines.

&quot;AI agents are not human, but they also do not behave like service accounts or scripts,&quot; Teleport CEO Ev Kontsevoy told us.

&quot;An agent functions around the clock and acts in unpredictable ways. For example, they may execute the same task with different approaches, continuously creating new access paths,&quot; he added. &quot;This requires accessing critical resources like MCP servers, APIs, databases, internal services, LLMs, and orchestration systems.&quot;

It also makes securing them using traditional identity and access management (IAM) and privileged access management (PAM) tools &quot;near impossible at scale,&quot; Kontsevoy said. &quot;Agents break traditional identity assumptions that legacy tools are built on, that identity is either human or machine.&quot;

AI agents are not human, but they also do not behave like service accounts or scripts

For decades, IAM and PAM have been critical in securing and managing user identities. IAM is used to identify and authorize all users across an organization, while PAM applies to more privileged users and accounts such as admins, securing and monitoring these identities with elevated permissions to access sensitive systems and data.

While this has more or less worked for human employees with predictable roles, it doesn&#39;t work for non-deterministic AI agents, which act autonomously and change their behavior on the fly. This can lead to security issues such as agents being granted excessive privileges, and &quot;shadow AI.&quot;

&quot;We are seeing a lot of shadow AI - someone using a personal account for ChatGPT or Cursor or Claude Code or any of these productivity tools,&quot; Tal said, adding that this can lead to &quot;blast-radius issues.&quot;

&quot;What I mean by that: they&#39;re risky agents,&quot; he said, explaining that some are essentially workflow experiments that someone in the organization created, and neither the IT nor security departments have any oversight.

&quot;What they have done is created a super-connected AI agent that is connected to every MCP server and every data source the company has,&quot; Tal said. &quot;We&#39;ve seen the problem of rogue MCP servers over and over again, where they compromise an agent and steal all of its tokens.&quot;

Fixing this requires visibility into both IT-sanctioned and unsanctioned AI agents being used, so they can be continuously monitored for misconfigurations or any other threats.

&quot;We do a risk assessment for each and every identity that we discover,&quot; Tal said. &quot;We look at its configuration, its connectivity, the permissions that it has. We look at its activity or history - journals, logs that we collect - so we can maintain a profile for each of these agents. After that, we want to put posture guardrails in place.&quot;

These are mitigating controls that prevent the agent from doing something or accessing something sensitive. Sometimes improving security is as easy as speaking to the human behind the AI agents about the risk they unknowingly introduced via the agent and what it can access.

&quot;We need to pop this bubble that agents come out of immaculate conception - a human is creating them, a human is provisioning their access,&quot; Spitler said. &quot;We need to associate tightly those agents with the human who created it, or the humans who work on it. We need to know who proxied their access to these other platforms, and what roles those accounts have in these platforms, so we understand the scope of access and potential impact of that agent&#39;s access in the wild.&quot;

Spitler says that&#39;s &quot;ground zero&quot; for managing and securing agentic identities. &quot;You need to know who your agents are.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ai-pocalypse The jury is still out when it comes to determining how much job loss AI is causing. However, we now have another case study. Dow Chemical blames AI automation for its plans to cut 4,500 jobs, about 12.5 percent of its work force.

The thousands of employees losing their jobs are being cut as part of a rhyming companywide initiative called “Transform to Outperform” that aims to radically simplify operations, and modernize its go-to-market playbook in the hopes of achieving $2 billion in EBITDA improvement by 2028.

&quot;The goal of Transform to Outperform is to achieve significant growth and productivity gains that elevate Dow&#39;s competitive position,&quot; said Karen S. Carter , Dow&#39;s chief operating officer, in the press release announcing the initiative. &quot;We are building on the momentum of our current self-help measures – transforming Dow into a company that is more resilient, consistently delivers growth, enables customer success, and delivers greater shareholder value across the cycle.&quot;

Dow is one of the biggest enterprises working with Palantir rival C3 AI, which uses a digital twin to map a company, its employees, products, and its processes in a hunt to find efficiencies.

“C3 AI has been pivotal in transforming Dow’s operations from reactive to predictive, optimizing asset performance to drive value. As we scale these solutions across Dow’s portfolio, we anticipate significant benefits,” said Debra Bauler, chief information and digital officer at Dow in a June 2025 press release. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with C3 AI as we advance a world-class predictive maintenance program and uncover further opportunities to enhance efficiency, reliability, and productivity throughout our operations.”

The two companies partnered last year on a predictive maintenance solution for the petrochemical industry through Dow’s subsidiary Univation Technologies, which was allowed to license and install C3 AI products.

“Our work with Dow sets the standard for how industrial companies can use AI to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize performance,” said Ed Abbo, Chief Technology Officer, C3 AI in the same June press release. “And this collaboration with Univation will accelerate adoption of this proven, domain-specific AI application across the broader petrochemical industry and support modernization across the market by delivering real, measurable benefits of AI at scale.”

El Reg asked Dow spokesperson to name the processes, software, and technologies that Dow plans to use to replace its employees, but the chemical giant didn&#39;t address the question.

“Through this work, we are leveraging best‑in‑class practices from across industries and high‑impact technologies, such as automation and AI, as we radically simplify our operating model and modernize how we serve our customers,” the spokesperson told The Register.

Dow’s employee numbers have held steady to around 36,000 since 2019. While the company did hire about 2,000 new employees between 2022 and 2023, growing to 37,800, by last year that number was back down to 36,000, according to annual reports and proxy filings.

Dow expects to spend $1.5 billion in one-time costs related to the job cuts with $600 million to $800 million of that going to severance for those let go, or between $133,333 and $177,777 per employee. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/ai_datacenter_boom_tripled_us_gas_power_builds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fossil fuel-fired power plant development is roaring back to life in the US thanks to the AI datacenter boom, with data from 2025 suggesting we&#39;re reaching the point where the renewable energy transition - and efforts to ease carbon emissions - may well be doomed.

2025 was a banner year for gas-fired power plant development in the US, nonprofit energy project tracking firm Global Energy Monitor (GEM) said in its latest analysis issued on Wednesday. Gas-fired power plant projects in development in the US nearly tripled last year, per GEM&#39;s data, putting the US ahead of China and responsible for around a quarter of the global gas power pipeline.

It&#39;s not exactly a close race, either. There are 251,737 megawatts of gas or oil fired plants (oil-fired plants are mainly located in Iraq and account for less than 3 percent of projects, GEM told us) in development in the US, in addition to 561,907 MW in operation. China, the second-ranking developer of natural gas and oil-fired power, is working on 153,406 MW of new projects, and has just 179,998 MW currently in use.

In other words, the US is looking at adding nearly 50 percent to its existing world-leading fleet of gas-fired power plants. More than a third of those new plants are directly linked to datacenter projects, GEM said.

If all the new projects in development end up being fired up, that&#39;ll equate to around 53.2 billion tonnes of lifetime CO₂ emissions, GEM global oil and gas plant tracking project manager Jenny Martos told The Register. 12.1 billion tonnes of that addition will come from US projects alone. For reference, the existing global fleet of gas and oil-fired power plants is estimated to account for 54.3 billion tonnes of lifetime emissions.

That means datacenters and AI are going to be a significant contributor to the derailing of global plans to quash climate change, and could be for some time.

&quot;This &#39;petrotech&#39; buildout risks tethering the power grid to fossil fuels for the next generation, thereby creating long-term pollution for a short-term power fix,&quot; Martos told us.

If AI actually turns out to be a bubble, that could mean a lot of lost investment in energy assets that end up stranded, causing even more financial devastation, Martos noted in GEM&#39;s writeup of its latest gas and oil project data.

With that in mind, it stands to reason that, even if the AI bubble bursts, a lot of oil and gas power is still going to end up making its way to the grid to offset potential losses, further hampering the transition away from fossil fuels and carbon pollution.

&quot;There is a real possibility of a gas lock-in if these plants get built and AI demand does not materialize,&quot; Martos told us.

The Trump administration has been pushing hard to side-step the clean energy transition in favor of the expediency of natural gas, but the US government isn&#39;t alone - tech companies are happy to take the easy path to datacenter construction and dreams of eventual AI profitability in spite of their pledges not to abandon the health of the planet and its residents.

Microsoft has admitted that it&#39;s open to deploying natural gas with carbon capture technology alongside renewables to meet datacenter demand, while Meta announced plans at the end of 2024 to deploy 2,262 MW of natural gas power to fuel its largest-ever datacenter mere days after pledging to focus on nuclear power to drive its AI expansion.

2026, notes GEM, is on pace to break the previous record of new natural gas deployment set in 2002 during the shale boom.

So sorry about those climate ambitions, planet Earth: Humans want AI slop, and the tech industry is going to give it to them, come burning, hellish temperatures, or ever-rising sea levels. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Crims love to make it look like their traffic is actually coming from legit homes and businesses, and they do so by using residential proxy networks. Now, Google says it has &quot;significantly degraded&quot; what it believes is one of the world&#39;s largest residential proxy networks.

Google&#39;s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) describes IPIDEA as a &quot;little-known component of the digital ecosystem&quot; and says that in a seven-day period in January 2026, it observed more than 550 threat groups using IPIDEA exit nodes.

GTIG said that proxy network operators sometimes pay app developers to embed proxy SDKs so that any device that downloads the app is enrolled in the network.

IPIDEA is also known to distribute proxy software and SDKs that enroll devices in its network, sometimes marketed as a way for users to &quot;monetize&quot; spare bandwidth.

The Googlers said that not only do these networks allow bad actors to conceal their malicious traffic, but users who enroll their devices are opening themselves up for further attacks, as their device may be used as a launchpad to compromise their other devices.

Researchers say the disruption reduced IPIDEA&#39;s available pool of devices by millions, spanning smartphones, Windows PCs, and other consumer hardware, with residential IPs in the US, Canada, and Europe seen as the most desirable.

They also discovered that IPIDEA operators were directly controlling some of the SDKs that were found in the apps enrolling people&#39;s devices into the network.

Proxy operators frequently pitch them as tools for privacy or freedom of expression, although security researchers say they are overwhelmingly abused by threat actors.

IPIDEA not only benefited cybercriminals seeking anonymity, but in several cases also enrolled the same devices it recruited to its proxy network into large botnets, including BadBox 2.0, Aisuru, and Kimwolf.

GTIG worked with industry partners to disrupt the IPIDEA network, including Spur and Lumen&#39;s Black Lotus Labs, to better understand its scale, and Cloudflare to disrupt IPIDEA&#39;s domain resolution.

The security experts&#39; work stops short of a claim of a full takedown: GTIG says its actions reduced IPIDEA&#39;s available pool of devices by millions and are intended to have downstream effects on affiliated operators and resellers.

&quot;Residential proxy networks have become a pervasive tool for everything from high-end espionage to massive criminal schemes,&quot; said John Hultquist, chief analyst at GTIG. &quot;By routing traffic through a person&#39;s home internet connection, attackers can hide in plain sight while infiltrating corporate environments.

&quot;By taking down the infrastructure used to run the IPIDEA network, we have effectively pulled the rug out from under a global marketplace that was selling access to millions of hijacked consumer devices.&quot; ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/escan_morphisec_dispute/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A spat has erupted between antivirus vendor eScan and threat intelligence outfit Morphisec over who spotted an update server incident that disrupted some eScan customers earlier this month.

Morphisec fired the opening salvo with a blog post calling the incident a &quot;critical supply-chain compromise,&quot; alleging hackers used eScan&#39;s own update system to push malicious files and interfere with cleanup. MicroWorld Technologies-owned eScan, however, says that Morphisec&#39;s account is wrong on multiple fronts.

In a statement to The Register, eScan said it detected suspicious activity through its internal monitoring before any external notification and initiated incident response the same day.

&quot;eScan detected suspicious activity through our internal monitoring systems on January 20, 2026, and immediately initiated our incident response protocol,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;We issued a preliminary security advisory to customers on January 21, 2026, along with a remediation patch.&quot;

The company alleges Morphisec published its blog and accompanying social posts later that day, claiming discovery and mischaracterizing the incident&#39;s technical details and scope.

The customer advisory eScan sent to affected users on January 22, as seen by The Register, offers a much narrower version of events. An unauthorized user gained access to configuration on a single regional update server, resulting in a rogue file briefly appearing in the update path for about two hours on January 20. The advisory states that the file distributed was not an official eScan binary or a legitimate update, and that no vulnerability existed in the eScan product itself.

According to eScan, machines that downloaded updates from the affected server during the short window could suddenly stop updating, display error pop-ups, or have their hosts files modified in a way that cut them off from eScan&#39;s update servers. eScan reports no sign that any data left the network, and says the antivirus continued to perform its day job throughout.

That doesn&#39;t square with Morphisec&#39;s depiction of a critical supply chain breach. eScan says Morphisec&#39;s write-up contains &quot;numerous factual inaccuracies,&quot; disputing claims about how the malware behaved and how systems were affected, and asserting that the incident was limited to a small number of systems in a specific region rather than affecting customers worldwide. When asked, eScan did not say which region was affected.

There is, however, some overlap between the two accounts. While eScan rejects the idea that affected systems were irreparably blocked from recovery, its own advisory instructs many customers to manually download and run a remediation tool on individual machines, often with support assistance, to restore update functionality. In other words, the fix existed, but in many cases it still required hands-on work.

eScan says it contacted affected customers over the next few days via email, phone, WhatsApp, and its support portal, and completed the cleanup within two to three days of identifying the issue. It also pulled its update infrastructure offline for checks, rebuilt the affected systems, rotated credentials, and tightened monitoring before bringing everything back online.

The dispute has since escalated beyond dueling accounts. eScan says it asked Morphisec to remove what it calls false claims, prompting the deletion of Morphisec&#39;s social media posts but not the blog itself. It also notes that several publications retracted articles based on Morphisec&#39;s claims after eScan raised concerns about their accuracy. eScan says it is now working with legal counsel regarding what it describes as demonstrably false statements.

&quot;We are concerned that Morphisec&#39;s publication contains multiple demonstrably false technical claims that we have documented in detail,&quot; the spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We stand behind the accuracy of our incident response and the integrity of our products.&quot;

Morphisec did not respond to The Register&#39;s questions, but appears to be standing by a revised version of its advisory that keeps the core narrative intact – including the claims that this was a &quot;critical eScan supply chain compromise.&quot; ®

            <h2>Uncle Sam dangles nuclear campuses for states while watering down safety rules</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/us_nuclear_campuses/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Energy (DOE) is inviting US states to host &quot;Nuclear Lifecycle Innovation Campuses&quot; to revitalize atomic power amid reports the agency has weakened safety rules governing the way nuclear sites operate.

The DOE issued a Request for Information (RFI) on Wednesday, seeking responses from states that may be interested in hosting the campuses, which will operate a &quot;full‑cycle nuclear ecosystem.&quot;

In practice, this means these sites will be expected to provide facilities for atomic waste reprocessing and disposal, in addition to fuel fabrication and enrichment. They may also serve as locations for nuclear reactors and co‑located datacenters powered by them.

News site Politico reported last week about talk of the Trump administration planning to steer &quot;billions, if not hundreds of billions&quot; in funding toward developing a domestic nuclear fuel cycle program to support rapid expansion of reactor construction. The DOE denied this at the time, according to other sources.

States are invited to indicate by no later than April 1 their interest in hosting potential Nuclear Lifecycle Innovation Campuses, and provide feedback on the incentives and other support they require.

In return, the DOE seeks information on approaches that prioritize private capital and the state&#39;s own funding, with only time‑limited federal support. It also expects &quot;robust financial assurances&quot; to protect federal taxpayers from open‑ended liabilities – meaning Washington doesn&#39;t want to pick up the tab if it all goes horribly wrong.

Last year, the DOE named ten companies it will work with to test and fast-track advanced atomic reactor projects, outside the scope of the agency&#39;s national laboratories, in line with President Trump&#39;s Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program.

California representative Mike Levin praised the new scheme, saying it is a meaningful and long-overdue step toward dealing with spent nuclear fuel.

&quot;For interested states, these campuses could deliver significant economic and job-creation benefits. The proposed campuses would support key functions across the nuclear fuel lifecycle, including fuel fabrication, enrichment, reprocessing used nuclear fuel, and waste disposal,&quot; he said in a statement.

But states considering the move should perhaps think carefully. A report from nonprofit media organization NPR claims the DOE has secretly rewritten nuclear safety directives governing atomic energy sites, significantly watering down the rules.

The changes were made to streamline the development of a new generation of nuclear reactors, which the Trump administration wants building to ensure there is enough power for all the new-build AI datacenters that are popping up, as well as growing electricity use in other sectors.

Hundreds of pages of requirements relating to security at reactors have simply been cut, according to NPR, and requirements for keeping records were trimmed. The level of radiation a worker can be exposed to before an official accident investigation gets triggered has been increased, and protections relating to groundwater and the environment weakened.

For example, protection of groundwater is no longer described as a &quot;must,&quot; replaced by wording that says companies must give &quot;consideration&quot; to &quot;avoiding or minimizing&quot; radioactive contamination.

Advocacy group the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) criticized the move.

&quot;This deeply troubling development confirms my worst fears about the dire state of nuclear power safety and security oversight under the Trump administration,&quot; UCS director of nuclear power safety Dr Edwin Lyman said in a statement.

&quot;The Energy Department has not only taken a sledgehammer to the basic principles that underlie effective nuclear regulation, but it has also done so in the shadows, keeping the public in the dark,&quot; he added, stating that regulations were developed over the course of many decades, incorporating lessons learned from painful events such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters.

Any new reactor designs will have to secure licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) before they are used to commercially produce power, the UCS points out. However, the NRC has agreed to restrict the scope of its additional safety and security reviews for facilities that have received DOE authorization. ®

The Neo headphones that roll up to become a Bluetooth speaker will be available for preorder starting on February 10th.

There’s never a shortage of weird tech debuting at CES every year. A new company called Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter, or TDM, announced a peculiar pair of headphones at the show earlier this month with a feature no one has tried before. The Neo headphones can be rolled up like a hedgehog which turns them into a compact Bluetooth speaker for those times when you want to share a real banger with those around you. They were expected to launch through a Kickstarter slated for this month, but TDM now says the crowdfunding campaign will officially open on February 10th, 2026.

Pricing for the Neo is set to be $249 when they eventually launch in July 2026, but those placing preorders by backing the Kickstarter can get the headphones discounted to $179.

Designed to make it easier to share music, the earcups on the Neo headphones each feature both inward and outward-facing 40mm drivers. In headphone mode only the inward-facing drivers are used for a private listening experience. When they’re rolled up, the Neo automatically switches to only using the outward-facing drivers for speaker mode, but there’s also a button for toggling between both modes manually.

The Verge’s John Higgins had the chance to go hands-on with the Neo during CES 2026. While the headphones were a bit heavy because of their batteries and extra hardware in each earcup, he also found that rolling them up to switch between modes was “easy and fast” and “a little bit of fun, too.”

Folding phones come with great responsibilities and great rewards.

A foldable phone isn’t for the faint of heart. They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. They’re also still not as durable as regular smartphones, though they’re not nearly as fragile as they once were. In fact, thanks to Google, we finally have a foldable phone we can take with us to the beach.

There are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.

Most phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.

Most modern foldables carry an IP48 rating, meaning they’re built to withstand full water immersion and solid particles 1mm or bigger. Devices with an IP48 rating aren’t fully protected from dust, which remains a concern when it comes to long-term durability. However, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold carries an IP68 rating, making it the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance.

In addition to the best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.

So while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.

If I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.

Full dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnets

Heavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather resistance: IP68

Durability has long been the North Star of the foldable category, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold marks a real milestone in that journey. With an IP68 rating, it’s the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance. That means you can take the $1,799 device on a hike or to the beach without worrying that a stray grain of sand will absolutely destroy it. Add in Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging — along with Google’s more powerful Tensor G5 chip — and you have the most well-rounded foldable available.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn’t without its shortcomings, though. It offers all-day battery life with minimal use of the inner display; however, if you spend most of your time using the inner screen, your battery will likely be in the red by bedtime. Also, while we love the device’s improved durability, its cameras fall short of Google’s other 10 Pro models, especially in low light. The foldable is a bit heavier and thicker than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, too, which is a fair trade for greater peace of mind.

Samsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable camera

More susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The latest Galaxy Z Flip may not be as fun as the newest Razr Ultra, but it does offer a few new tricks. Samsung ditched the old file-folder cover screen in favor of a glorious, 4.1-inch edge-to-edge panel that wraps around the cameras. The extra real estate means you have more room to quickly respond to messages or perform any task that doesn’t require you to open your phone (and risk getting lost in a digital rabbit hole).

In addition to the larger cover screen, the Flip 7 offers a couple of other thoughtful updates. It’s thinner than its predecessor and features a bigger 4,300mAh battery, which is a step up from the 4,000mAh battery found in the last-gen Flip 6. The camera system remains unchanged from last year’s model, too, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The 50-megapixel main shooter still produces great images, and you get all the versatility the flip form factor has to offer, including the ability to easily take selfies using the rear camera.

Despite some welcome changes, the Flip 7 carries the same IP48 rating as last year’s model, which means long-term durability against fine dust particles remains a concern. However, Samsung offers a great warranty and repair program, along with seven years of OS and security updates. The Flip 7 isn’t perfect, but it’s the most powerful and polished version yet — just don’t drop it while lounging on the beach.

One of the best-looking phones you can buyGreat battery lifeOuter screen is useful in unexpected ways

AI button is wasted real estate Long-term durability is still a question markCamera processing is occasionally weird

Screen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.

Beyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing. Meanwhile, Motorola is only promising three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which is on the shorter side considering the $1,300 retail price.

It’s really, really thinExcellent battery lifeThe crease is almost invisible

Foldables are still fragileIt’s not launching in the US or Europe

Screen: 8.12-inch, 2248p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.62-inch, 1140p, 120Hz OLED outer screen size/ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 8-megapixel selfie cameras (inner and outer) / Battery: 5,600mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IPX8/IPX9

Let’s get the bad news out of the way first: if you live in the US or Europe, you can’t buy the Oppo Find N5. That rules out, well, a lot of us. But if you live in China, Singapore, or any of the other Asian countries Oppo included in its so-called “global” release, then you’re in luck: you can pick up one of the world’s thinnest book-style folding phones, and the rest of us are all very jealous of you.

The Find N5 isn’t all about thinness, either. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is highly capable, the phone is fully water-resistant, and battery life is excellent. It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology to accommodate a large (by foldable standards) 5,600mAh battery, which easily holds up after a long day of heavy use. What’s even more impressive is that, like the aforementioned Z Fold 7, the Find N5 is still barely thicker than a standard slab-style phone and only slightly heavier. That matters when you’re using the phone via the cover screen for long periods of time or stashing it in the side pocket of your yoga pants. When a foldable is only about as heavy and bulky as a regular phone, using the inner screen feels like getting away with something fantastic — not a benefit you have to make many other sacrifices for. Oppo delivers this in spades, and I just wish more of us could… find it.

SpaceX is planning an IPO later this year, and the merger could happen before that.

SpaceX and xAI, which are both led by Elon Musk, are “in discussions to merge” ahead of SpaceX’s IPO that’s planned for later this year, Reuters reports. The merger would help with SpaceX’s plans to launch data centers into space, according to the publication.

The specific timing and value of the potential merger are unclear. SpaceX is considering an IPO date in mid-June, the Financial Times reported this week. xAI and SpaceX didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.

If SpaceX merges with xAI, it would put the rocket company in the same house as Grok, which is under significant scrutiny and even an investigation in the EU over sexualized deepfakes.Should the deal go through, it would be just the latest transaction between Elon Musk-led companies. Tesla, which also counts Musk as CEO, said this week that it would be investing “approximately” $2 billion investment in xAI. xAI also bought X last year.

﻿FT reports Apple is paying $2 billion for Q.ai, an audio startup that uses facial expressions to understand you without a word.

Apple’s biggest acquisition ever is still its $3 billion Beats buy in 2014, but now the second biggest deal is bringing in Q.ai, a four-year-old AI audio startup. Apple did not disclose the terms, but Financial Times reports that Apple is spending $2 billion on the company. It also mentioned Q.ai patents for optical sensor technology that could be built into headphones or glasses to recognize “facial skin micro movements,” allowing for non-verbal discussions with an AI assistant, for example.

The founders of Q.ai will join Apple, including CEO Aviad Maizels, who founded PrimeSense. Apple bought that company in 2013 and repurposed its Xbox Kinect technology to power the iPhone’s FaceID setup. This time around, tech that understands whispered speech could connect to the generative AI-upgraded Siri or other Apple Intelligence features, and work with future AirPods, Vision Pro, iPhone, or Mac devices.

In a statement provided to Reuters, Apple hardware exec Johnny Srouji called Q.ai “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.” Google Ventures has backed the startup, and managing partner Tom Hulme wrote in a blog post about how this could help us find out “what happens when the computer finally ‘disappears’ into our daily lives.”

It’s not meaningfully better than the competition. Plus, its software is messy and overstuffed.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Webcam company Obsbot recently launched two new gimbal-equipped webcams, the $349 Tiny 3 and the $199 Tiny 3 Lite. It claims that the priciest model is the smallest pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) 4K webcam ever made, weighing 63 grams. Ironically, the Tiny 3 Lite is heavier and bigger. I’ve been testing the Tiny 3 for a couple of weeks, and here’s what you should know about it.

Compared to Insta360’s newish $249 Link 2 Pro, the Tiny 3 has a slightly bigger sensor and more AI-powered features, including voice control and voice tracking. It also has MEMS mics, which are supposedly better than condenser mics at filtering unwanted noise, and Obsbot claims they’re as good as a dedicated microphone. I only have my Insta360 Link from 2022 on hand to compare it to. And while the Tiny 3 can produce a sharper image than the Link, it’s not a night-and-day difference based on my testing with final retail hardware.

You can boss both the Tiny 3 and the Lite around with preset questions (“Hi, Tiny” to turn on, “Sleep, Tiny” to turn off, “Track Me” to turn on AI-powered face tracking, “Position 1” to snap to a saved camera position, etc.), but only the pricier model has Desk Mode that lets it look downward because the Lite’s base is too thick (the original Link has a Desk Mode, too). The Tiny 3 listens remarkably well, even when I sort of mutter the commands. Although, seeing it start to track my face when I uttered the phrase “track me” during a meeting was weird enough that I turned off the voice control feature. They both advertise 4K / 30 frames per second video capture and up to 120 frames per second at 1080p. They also support the Switch 2, but require the companion app to toggle on the mode. Enabling that mode sets 1080p as the maximum resolution on PC until you disable it.

The Tiny 3 has a slightly wider field of view, and its ISO can go higher (12800 versus 6400 maximum ISO) in dimly lit rooms. It packs a 1/1.28-inch sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and a 24-millimeter equivalent focal length, which are improvements over the last-gen model, however incremental. Bigger sensors can capture more light, presenting images with less noise. Those gains weren’t all that noticeable during my testing, but they might be for others, since everyone’s work area looks different.

Video capture at 4K / 30 frames per second looks fine on the Tiny 3 in video calls. It produces sharper footage than the Lite and the Link, and as seen in the raw stills captured through Obsbot’s software, it’s better at resolving shadows seen in my wrinkled long-sleeve shirt. The stills should illustrate just how close they all are in visual quality. There are differences in how they handle contrast, but I don’t think the $350 model is the clear winner in either snapshot sample. That’s really notable considering my Insta360 Link is about 3 years old.

As previously mentioned, the company claims the webcam’s MEMS mic array (two directional, one omnidirectional) can rival performance from a standalone mic. They sound good, but I couldn’t tell the difference until I picked up my guitar and started strumming. I could hear individual plucks of guitar strings through the Tiny 3’s mic better than the Link that I have on hand. The extra detail is nice, although if you’re primarily using the Tiny 3 for video calls, it’s likely to get compressed, sadly. Also, most people who care about how their voices or instruments sound likely already have a standalone mic.

I’d be more impressed with the Tiny 3 if it were priced more competitively. But even then, I’d be reluctant to recommend it given the state of its companion app. To put it lightly, it’s an overstuffed mess to navigate, with useful features nested in tough-to-find places next to ones you’ll likely never touch again.

I get that webcams increasingly have a ton of features, and while I’m not arguing against more features to justify high prices, it’s up to these companies to make a webcam’s features easy to use, especially when you’re in a rush before or during a call. Insta360 has figured this out, and Obsbot has not.

            <h2>Everything is gambling now: the latest news on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/868238/prediction-markets-polymarket-kalshi-robinhood">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prediction markets will let you bet on just about anything, from how many tweets Elon Musk will post this week to the next president of the United States, with predictions sometimes showing shockingly (or suspiciously) spot-on accuracy. Polymarket’s CEO Shayne Copland has even claimed that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now.”

However, these platforms blur the lines — in terms of both function and regulation — between gambling and stock trading. As Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal said on The Vergecast, “All of the lines between trading, speculating, [and] gambling are just being completely torn apart.”

There are also ethical concerns surfacing around prediction markets, like whether it’s acceptable to be able to place a bet on virtually everything, along with concerns about insider trading. For instance, a newly-created Polymarket account made over $400,000 in January betting on the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Polymarket — the same platform someone made thousands of dollars betting on Nicolás Maduro’s arrest — has 48 hours to cease operations in Portugal after users wagered more than 103 million euros (~$120 million) on the outcome of the country’s presidential election, according to a report from CoinDesk.

Political betting is illegal in Portugal, and its gambling regulator says Polymarket doesn’t have a license to operate in the country, CoinDesk reports.

On December 31st, a brand-new account on Polymarket placed a bet: Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, would be out of office by the end of January. It was the first in a series of increasing bets. On January 3rd, the US bombed the Venezuelan capital, kidnapped Maduro and his wife, and killed at least 80 people along the way. The account cashed out with almost half a million dollars.

It would be a misread to describe the surprise invasion of Venezuela as imperial expansion driven by the dictates of capitalism; it is, somehow, worse. Normal capitalism requires a working relationship with reality. Normal capitalism thrives on predictability. The Trump administration is behaving like gambling addicts chasing clout in an attention economy. Venezuela is a fucking meme stock.

Shortly before the US military launched an attack on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, an account on Polymarket made some very suspiciously timed investments. The prediction market had been running bets on when or if Maduro would be removed from power, with prices for “out by January 31, 2026” as low as $0.07 late Friday evening. But within 24 hours of the military action, a newly created account invested tens of thousands of dollars, racking up several hundred thousand in profits.

The account was created less than a week ago and invested over $30,000 the day before the assault, turning a profit of over $408,000. The activity was flagged on social media, with people speculating that the person placing the bet was acting on inside information and perhaps even worked at the Pentagon. Joe Pompliano, an investor and podcaster, quickly pointed out on X that “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

“Prediction markets” continue to appear everywhere, including CNN and CNBC, and Polymarket is shitposting about citizen journalism.

Meanwhile, The Athletic is the latest (following Awful Announcing and Front Office Sports) reporting on sports misinformation X accounts like “Emma Vance” and “Scott Hughes” have spread while sporting those site’s affiliate badges.

Here’s a list of things you can bet on, right this second. This year’s Super Bowl winner, sure. The winner of Survivor season 49, okay. But the number of gifts Santa will deliver this year? The number of tweets Elon Musk will send in the next 7 days? How much money Avatar: Fire and Ash will make at the box office? The next president of of Portugal? On Polymarket and Kalshi, if you can dream it up, you can probably bet on it. Welcome to the age of the prediction market.

On this episode of The Vergecast, we try to figure out where prediction markets came from, and why they’ve become so popular. Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal joins the show to track the rise of Polymarket and Kalshi, explain their controversies and ultimate acceptance, and put these companies in their correct place in the economy. Most of all, he helps us figure out if there’s actually something new happening here, or if the betting has been happening forever.

This is an excerpt of Sources by Alex Heath, a newsletter about AI and the tech industry, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

At 8PM on election night in New York City, I arrived at an unmarked office building in the Meatpacking District.

If you’ve been on social media lately, you might’ve seen the unsettling AI slop videos showing AI-generated people in wild scenarios or just speaking a bunch of nonsense. On Wednesday night, the betting platform Kalshi decided to take this trend outside the social sphere by putting a nonsensical AI-generated ad in front of the millions of viewers watching the NBA Finals — and it apparently cost just $2,000 to make.

The AI-generated highlights various things “people” are betting on, like whether the Oklahoma City Thunder or Indiana Pacers will win the NBA Finals, how many hurricanes will occur this year, and whether the price of eggs will go up this month. It flashes between scenes of an elderly man wearing a cowboy hat while carrying a chihuahua, someone swimming in a pool of eggs, and an alien chugging beer.

Today, I’m talking with Vlad Tenev, the cofounder and CEO of Robinhood, which is one of the most well-known consumer finance apps in the world. It started as a way to open up stock trading, but the company’s ambitions have grown over time — and they’re getting even bigger.

Just a day before Tenev and I talked, Robinhood announced it would soon be offering bank accounts and wealth management services, which would allow Robinhood to be involved with your money at every possible level.

A new tidbit about the prediction markets startup from last week’s issue of Command Line:

Coplan recently raised, but has yet to announce, a $30 million round of funding at a $350 million valuation. And in recent conversations with investors (a surprising number of whom passed on the round, which was less than Coplan hoped to raise), I’m told he was noncommittal about whether the company would work to get the Commodity Futures Trading Commission license it needs to operate in the US.

It wasn’t immediately clear what prompted the FBI’s search of [Shayne] Coplan, the 26-year-old entrepreneur behind one of the most successful prediction markets in history. But Polymarket quickly tied the raid to its track record in the recent presidential election, in which bettors on its platform correctly anticipated that Donald Trump would beat Vice President Kamala Harris.

Bloomberg also reports that Polymarket is being investigated by the DOJ for allegedly letting users in the US place bets on the site.

This week’s presidential election introduced a lot of people to prediction markets.

Kalshi was the number one app in the App Store on Election Day. The CEO of Polymarket claims the Trump campaign first realized they were winning from his startup’s stats, which showed them winning by a landslide hours before news networks called the race. There’s a sense in some tech and finance circles that these betting markets are now a better “wisdom of the crowd” indicator than polls.

The startup has received “tens of millions from investors in short-term loans“ to make sure it can cover election bets:

Like most brokerages, the company offers instant funding to new users. This means users can start trading right away, even though it may take two to three business days for the funds to be officially transferred from the customer’s bank account to Kalshi’s.

US citizens can gamble on the upcoming election on Robinhood, the financial nihilism app announced. Robinhood has termed this “unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold.”

Let’s pause — I would like to reflect on this incredible phrase, about an asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold. See, I thought we all had access to the events of the election because we all exist in reality and can find out about them. But apparently, if we can’t gamble on an event, it isn’t happening. This is a fascinating vision of metaphysics, and I would like to hear more about it. No one bet on my birth, for instance, and thus there is no asset class relating to my existence. So am I real?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

What AI “remembers” about you is privacy’s next frontier

—Miranda Bogen, director of the AI Governance Lab at the Center for Democracy & Technology, & Ruchika Joshi, fellow at the Center for Democracy & Technology specializing in AI safety and governance

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather? Read the full story.

The flawed logic of rushing out extreme climate solutionsEarly in 2022, entrepreneur Luke Iseman says, he released a pair of sulfur dioxide–filled weather balloons from Mexico’s Baja California peninsula, in the hope that they’d burst miles above Earth.It was a trivial act in itself, effectively a tiny, DIY act of solar geoengineering, the controversial proposal that the world could counteract climate change by releasing particles that reflect more sunlight back into space.Entrepreneurs like Iseman invoke the stark dangers of climate change to explain why they do what they do—even if they don’t know how effective their interventions are. But experts say that urgency doesn’t create a social license to ignore the underlying dangers or leapfrog the scientific process. Read the full story.—James Temple

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.

One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.

Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?

Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.

So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.

Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.

The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.

PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.

Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.

One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.

Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told Inside Climate News this week.

Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)

PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.

The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)

We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.

No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.

            <div id="article-text">“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?”

Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s number one priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.

“If you believe that life is good and there&#39;s inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”

Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible moral duty for all of us to get involved in.”

It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.

No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.

Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”

“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal the driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.

“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.

To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they could exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.

For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.

Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.

All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.

Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events.

I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay. Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”

Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.

The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.

Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”

When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.

I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)

The key to Vitalism has always been that “death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”

Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.

As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)

In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)

“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”

A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through The Big Short.”

Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.

So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)

The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.

After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.

“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”

Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:

While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.

Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.

Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?

It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.

The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.

This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”

Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.

I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”

But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.

Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”

His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: Yes, please murder me at this time?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)

But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.

Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.

The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.

The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.

Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.

To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.

That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.

These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.

A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.

There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.

One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.

Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”

Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.

“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. Though “kind of a terrible example,” he notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.

Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)

During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”

Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.

Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”

In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.

Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.

Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.

Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”

Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. Though “kind of a terrible example,” Hamalainen notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”

Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.

Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.

Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.

For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.

And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.

Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)

Still, because Kendziorra agrees with almost everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”

Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist label as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.

Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”

And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.

For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)

O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.

The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)

But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”

Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)

And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.

Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”

Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.

Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.

Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.

Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.

Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”

Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”

Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.

He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.

But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.

“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”

There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.

Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.
