            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Crew Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Valentine’s Day, and astronauts popped open the hatches at 5:14 pm ET (22:14 UTC) on Saturday evening.

The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew 12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—brought the total number of crew on board the space station to seven, giving the US space agency a full complement in orbit.

The number of astronauts living on board the station fluctuates over time, depending on crew rotations and private astronauts making shorter stays, but since Crew Dragon began flying regularly at the end of 2020 NASA has sought to keep at least four “USOS” astronauts on board at all time. This stands for “US Orbital Segment,” and means astronauts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan who are trained to operate the areas of the station maintained by NASA and its partner astronauts.

However, after one of the four Crew-11 astronauts experienced a health emergency a few days into the new year, NASA made an unprecedented decision to bring them home early. NASA has not named the afflicted Crew-11 astronaut, but the flier is said to be recovering on Earth.

After these astronauts departed on January 15, just a single NASA astronaut, Chris Williams, remained in orbit. He had reached space on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in November, alongside two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev. The space station is a big place, and with much of the facility now more than two decades old, Williams had to spend the majority of his time on maintenance and monitoring activities.

Back on Earth, NASA and SpaceX engineers were busy too. Because Crew 11 was brought home more than a month early, NASA and SpaceX scrambled to launch the Crew-12 vehicle a little sooner than expected, to minimize the time Williams had to manage the large US segment of the station on his own.

That culminated with a successful Dragon launch early on Friday, with the reinforcements reaching the space station on Saturday evening.

“This mission has shown, in many ways, what it means to be mission focused at NASA,” said the space agency’s administrator, Jared Isaacman, during a post-launch news conference. “In the last couple of weeks we brought Crew 11 home early, we pulled forward Crew 12, all while simultaneously making launch preparations for the Artemis II mission. It’s only possible because of the incredibly talented workforce we have here at NASA alongside our contractors, and our commercial and international partners.”</div>

            <h2>Ancient Mars was warm and wet, not cold and icy</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/ancient-mars-was-warm-and-wet-not-cold-and-icy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A recent study showed that Mars was warm and wet billions of years ago. The finding contrasts with another theory that this era was mainly cold and icy. The result has implications for the idea that life could have developed on the planet at this time.

Whether Mars was once habitable is a fascinating and intensely researched topic of interest over many decades. Mars, like the Earth, is about 4.5 billion years old and its geological history is divided into different epochs of time.

The latest paper relates to Mars during a time called the Noachian epoch, which extended from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. This was during a stage in solar system history called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Evidence for truly cataclysmic meteorite impacts during the LHB are found on many bodies throughout the solar system.

Two obvious scars from this era on Mars are the enormous Hellas and Argyre impact basins; both are well over a thousand miles across and each possesses enough volume to hold all the water in the Mediterranean with room to spare.

One might not imagine such a time being conducive to the existence of fragile lifeforms, yet it is likely to be the era in which Mars was most habitable. Evidence of landforms sculpted by water from this time is plentiful and include dried-up river valleys, lake beds, ancient coastlines and river deltas.

The prevailing climatic conditions of the Noachian are still a matter of intense debate. Two alternative scenarios are
typically posited: that this time was cold and icy, with occasional melting of large volumes of frozen water by meteorite impact and volcanic eruptions, or that it was warm, wet and largely ice-free.

All stars, including the Sun, brighten with age. In the early solar system, during the Noachian, the Sun was about 30% dimmer than it is today, so less heat was reaching Mars (and all the planets). To sustain a warm, wet climate at this time, the Martian atmosphere would have needed to be very substantial – much thicker than it is today – and abundant in greenhouse gases like CO2.

But when reaching high enough atmospheric pressure, CO2 tends to condense out of the air to form clouds and reduce the greenhouse effect. Given these issues, the cold, icy scenario is perhaps more believable.

One of the main science goals of the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, which landed spectacularly in February 2021, is to seek evidence to support either of these two scenarios, and the new
paper using data from Perseverance may have done just that.

Perseverance landed at the Martian location of Jezero crater, which was selected as the landing site because it once contained a lake. Views of the crater from orbit show several distinct fan-shaped deposits emanating from channels carved through the crater walls by flowing water. Within these channels are abundant deposits of clay minerals.

The new paper details recent analysis of aluminum-rich clay pebbles, called kaolinite, located within one of the ancient flow channels. The pebbles appear to have been subjected to intense weathering and chemical alteration by water during the Noachian.

While this is perhaps not surprising for a known ancient watery environment, what is interesting is that these clays are strongly depleted in iron and magnesium, and enriched in titanium and aluminum.

This is important because it means these rocks were less likely to have been altered in a hydrothermal environment, where scalding hot water was temporarily released by melting ice caused by volcanism or a meteorite impact.

Instead, they appear to have been altered under modest temperatures and persistent heavy rainfall. The authors found distinct similarities between the chemical composition of these clay pebbles with similar clays found on Earth dating from periods in our planet’s history when the climate was much warmer and wetter.

The paper concludes that these kaolinite pebbles were altered under high rainfall conditions comparable to “past greenhouse climates on Earth” and that they “likely represent some of the wettest intervals and possibly most habitable portions of Mars’ history”.

Furthermore, the paper concludes that these conditions may have persisted over time periods ranging from thousands to millions of years. Perseverance recently made headlines also for the discovery of possible biosignatures in samples it collected last year, also from within Jezero crater.

These precious samples have now been cached in special sealed containers on the rover for collection by a future Mars sample return mission. Unfortunately, the mission has recently been cancelled by Nasa and so what vital evidence they may or may not contain will probably not be examined in an Earth-based laboratory for many years.

Crucial to this future analysis is the so-called “Knoll criterion” – a concept formulated by astrobiologist Andrew Knoll, which states that for something to be evidence of life, an observation has to not just be explicable by biology; it has to be inexplicable without it. Whether these samples ever satisfy the Knoll criterion will only be known if they can be brought to Earth.

Either way, it is quite striking to imagine a time on Mars, billions of years before the first humans walked the Earth, that a tropical climate with – possibly – a living ecosystem once existed in the now desolate and wind-swept landscape of Jezero crater.

            <div id="article-text">On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published an article containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.

That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.

Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.

We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?

The film has been analysed and re-analysed countless times. Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature.

But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in the duo’s recent book “Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science.”

Here, we talk to them about their academic investigation.

Lewis: It started when I was watching either the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and a show called Finding Bigfoot was advertised. I was really keen to know why this program was being scheduled on what certainly at the time was a nominally serious and sober natural history channel. The initial plan was to do an analysis of these television programmes, but we felt that wasn’t enough. It was lockdown and my wife was pregnant and in bed a lot with sickness, so I needed to fill my time.

Bartlett: One of the things that I worked on when Jamie and I shared an office in Cardiff was a sociological study of fringe physicists. These are people mostly outside of academic institutions trying to do science. I was interviewing these people, going to their conferences. And that led relatively smoothly into Bigfoot, but it was Jamie’s interest in Bigfoot that brought me to this field.

Lewis: It’s very hard to put a number on it. There is certainly a divide between what are known as “apers,” who believe that Bigfoot is just a primate unknown to science, and those that are perhaps more derogatorily called “woo-woos,” who believe that Bigfoot is some sort of interdimensional traveller, an alien of sort. We’re talking in the thousands of people. But there are a couple of hundred really serious people of which I probably interviewed at least half.

Many people back them. A YouGov survey conducted as recently as November 2025, suggested that as many as one quarter of Americans believe that Bigfoot either definitely or probably exists.

Lewis: I think there was definitely a worry that they would be caricatured. And I was often asked, “Do I believe in Bigfoot?” I had a standard answer that Andy and I agreed on, which was that mainstream, institutional science says there is absolutely no compelling evidence that Bigfoot exists. We have no reason to dissent with that consensus. But as sociologists what does exist is a community (or communities) of Bigfooting, and that’s what interests us.

Bartlett: One of the things that at least a couple of people reacted to once the book was published was the way we phrased that. On the blurb on the back of the book we say something along the lines of “Bigfoot exists if not as a physical biological creature then certainly as an object around which hundreds of people organise their lives.” A couple of people took that to be some kind of slight against them. It wasn’t.

Lewis: The community is very white, male, rural, and blue collar—often ex-military. I think Bigfooting is growing among the female population, but there’s a sense of the kind of ‘masculine hunter in the dark’ persona.

Bartlett: In America, you find a lot more veterans in the general population. But I think there’s also the issue of how they like to present themselves, because when you’re dealing with witness testimony, you’ve got to present yourself as credible. If you can say something like, “I was in the service” or “I was in the armed forces,” then at least you’re not likely to be spooked by a moose.

Lewis: Some were very articulate, which did surprise me a little. I guess that’s my own prejudice. I was also very surprised about how open people were; I expected them to not tell me about their encounters. But a fair few of them did. Many of them wanted to be named in the book. I was also surprised about how much empirical data they collect and how much they attempt to try and analyse and make sense of it. And how they were willing to admit that a certain idea was bunk or a hoax. I expected them to be defending bad evidence.

Bartlett: There are extracts of this in our book, people saying “I was fooled by these tracks for ages. I thought they were real and then I found this and that and the other out about it and I revised my opinion.” So that did surprise me too.

Bartlett: When you’re working in institutional science you’re working to get grants, you’re working to get good quality publications. You might want your name associated with particular ideas, but you do that through peer-reviewed papers and by working with PhD students who go off to other labs. In Bigfooting, you’ve got self-published books, you’ve got Bigfoot conferences, you’ve got YouTube channels, you’ve got podcasts and things like this, and they’re not necessarily a good way of making and testing knowledge claims. This is an aspect where Bigfooting is quite different to mainstream science.

It was interesting to study the fringe physicists and seeing where the common deviation from science was. And that’s a focus on individualism; the idea that an individual alone can collect and assess evidence in some kind of asocial fashion. The physicists I studied were quite clear that ideas like consensus in science were dangerous, when in reality, consensus, continuity, and community are the basis of most of science.

Lewis: Witness testimonies. Without those reported testimonies, Bigfooting would not exist. A large part of the work of a Bigfooter is to collect and make sense of these testimonies. They get upset when these testimonies don’t have much weight within institutional science. They’ll make the comparison to court and how testimonies alone can put someone on death row. So they don’t understand why testimonies don’t have much weight in science. Beyond the testimony, footprint evidence is probably the most famous and also the most pervasive sort of trace evidence.

Bartlett: One of the reasons footprints are so important is that there’s the legacy of the Yeti and footprint evidence which proved to be relatively persuasive, convincing some institutional scientists that there was something in the Himalayas. And then there was the fact that the sort of two major academic champions of Bigfoot were persuaded by the footprint evidence: the late Grover Krantz (around 1970) and Jeffrey Meldrum (in the 1990s).

Lewis: These days, you also see camera traps, audio recorders, even DNA testing of hairs and those sorts of things. They’re capturing anomalous sounds and often blurry images. Some believe that a Bigfoot communicates through infrasound, although that is certainly disputed within the community. So what you’re getting now is more and more different types of evidence.

Bartlett: What they do is go out into the forest and record a sound, for example, and compare it to databases of birds and other animals. And they may find there is nothing that matches it. Is it something that doesn’t sound like a car or a person or a bear or a moose? In which case, there’s the space for Bigfoot. And it’s the same with images to some degree.

Lewis: It allows them to create space for Bigfoot. Because if you can’t match it to something else, what could it be? You have this absence and then from that absence you create a presence. They believe it’s a scientific argument. In fact, it’s kind of interesting how Bigfooters will always enrol other kinds of magical beasts to strengthen the case for Bigfoot. So, one sentence I hear quite a lot is “it ain’t no unicorn.”

Lewis: A-listers tend to be anyone associated with academia. So Andy’s already mentioned Jeff Meldrum, unfortunately he passed away very recently, but he was their route to contemporary academia. So in any conference, if Jeff Meldrum was speaking, he’d be last. Anyone who’s on TV, such as the Finding Bigfoot and the Expedition Bigfoot presenters would also be in the A-list category. And then you’ve got various different groups just below. For example, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which is probably the most well-known group.

Lewis: From reading books and from discussing it with people, there was a sense that Bigfooters are anti-science. We did not find that. What we argue in the book is that they’re not anti-science. In fact, I would say a lot of them are pro-science, but they’re counter-establishment. I think academia should be thinking about these people as citizen scientists and what they’re doing as a kind of gateway into understanding your local area.

For example, they found an animal, I think it was a pine marten, on a camera trap that was not supposed to be in the area. So they are collecting lots of data. They are not irrational. It’s different from, for example, ghost hunting, because you don’t have to imagine there’s something entirely new in the world. It’s just an animal that exists out there that hasn’t been found. Implausible, yes. But not impossible. What they do lack, however, is academic discipline; anyone can be a Bigfooter.

Lewis: Did I get caught up in the moment? Sometimes, of course, you do, just as you do in a film. If you’re in the pitch dark night and you’re watching a horror film, you take it away with you for a while until you settle back down. I often went to bed buzzing, thinking I don’t know what I just heard; they were great stories at the end of the day. But I learned to separate the interview from my thoughts on the interview.

Lewis: A lot of Bigfooters would begin with qualifiers like, “My dad doesn’t believe in Bigfoot,” or “I have questioned myself for years thinking about this incident and what it was.” So, they would set themselves up as a rational, logical individual. That then created a connection between me and them. And of course, I’d probably be doing the same.

Bartlett: If I were to encounter Bigfoot, I would probably draw on all the techniques of proving that I’m a credible, hard-headed, rational person that we see in those witness encounters. I would expect to be disbelieved. And so therefore I would stress I was putting my credibility as an academic on the line here. So I’d deploy all those kinds of rhetorical techniques that are used by Bigfooters, aside from just the description of the encounter.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission.

Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is preparing for a second countdown rehearsal as soon as next week to confirm whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run February 2.

Artemis II is the first crew flight for SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth.

Fuel leaks are nothing new for the Space Launch System. The same kind of leak delayed the first test flight of the SLS rocket for several months in 2022. With that launch, ground teams thought they fixed the problem by changing how they load super-cold liquid hydrogen into the rocket’s core stage. The launch team used the same loading procedure February 2, but the leak cropped up again.

“Considering the issues observed during the lead-up to Artemis I, and the long duration between missions, we should not be surprised there are challenges entering the Artemis II campaign,” Isaacman wrote Saturday in an update on the social media site X. “That does not excuse the situation, but we understand it. I am impressed with the NASA team and our contractors working diligently through the campaign.”

Engineers traced the fueling issues to ground support equipment. Specifically, the hydrogen leaks originate in the area where fueling lines on the rocket’s launch platform connect to the bottom of the core stage. Two Tail Service Mast Umbilicals, or TSMUs, route liquid hydrogen and and liquid oxygen into the rocket during the countdown, then disconnect and retract into protective housings at liftoff.

The TSMU supplying liquid hydrogen to the core stage has two lines, 8 inches and 4 inches in diameter, connecting through matching umbilical plates on the ground side and the rocket side. Technicians replaced seals around the two fueling lines after the practice countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), earlier this month.

On Thursday, NASA’s launch team tested the seals by partially filling the core stage with liquid hydrogen. This “confidence test” ended earlier than planned when the launch team encountered a new problem that reduced the flow of fuel into the rocket. In a statement released Friday night, NASA said workers will replace a filter suspected to be the cause of the reduced flow before proceeding into the next WDR.

The confidence test ended as the launch team transitioned to “fast fill” mode for liquid hydrogen, when pressures and flow rates put the finicky seals through the most stress. However, NASA said engineers achieved several key objectives of the confidence test.

Isaacman wrote Saturday that the test “provided a great deal of data, and we observed materially lower leak rates compared to prior observations during WDR-1.”

Although the launch team wasn’t able to test the seals in the most stressing conditions Thursday, officials apparently got enough data to move forward to the next WDR. During this upcoming test, NASA will attempt to fully load hydrogen and oxygen into the rocket and count down to less than a minute before launch, before stopping the clock and draining the SLS propellant tanks.

In his social media post, Isaacman characterized the outcome of Thursday’s confidence test this way: “I would not say something broke that caused the premature end to the test, as much as we observed enough and reached a point where waiting out additional troubleshooting was unnecessary.”

During the first WDR earlier this month, hydrogen gas concentrations in the area around the fueling connection spiked higher than 16 percent, NASA’s safety limit. This spike was higher than any of the leak rates observed during the Artemis I launch campaign in 2022. Since then, NASA reassessed their safety limit and raised it from 4 percent—a conservative rule NASA held over from the Space Shuttle program—to 16 percent.

John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis II mission management team, said the decision to relax the safety limit between Artemis I and Artemis II was grounded in test data.

“The SLS program, they came up with a test campaign that actually looked at that cavity, the characteristics of the cavity, the purge in the cavity … and they introduced hydrogen to see when you could actually get it to ignite, and at 16 percent, you could not,” said Honeycutt, who served as NASA’s SLS program manager before moving to his new job.

Hydrogen is explosive in high concentrations when mixed with air. This is what makes hydrogen a formidable rocket fuel. But it is also notoriously difficult to contain. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest molecule, meaning it can readily escape through leak paths, and poses a materials challenge for seals because liquified hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius).

So, it turns out NASA used the three-year interim between Artemis I and Artemis II to get comfortable with a more significant hydrogen leak, instead of fixing the leaks themselves. Isaacman said that will change before Artemis III, which likewise is probably at least three years away.

“I will say near-conclusively for Artemis III, we will cryoproof the vehicle before it gets to the pad, and the propellant loading interfaces we are troubleshooting will be redesigned,” Isaacman wrote.

Isaacman took over as NASA’s administrator in December, and has criticized the SLS program’s high cost—estimated by NASA’s inspector general at more than $2 billion per rocket—along with the launch vehicle’s torpid flight rate.

NASA’s expenditures for the rocket’s ground systems at Kennedy Space Center are similarly enormous. NASA spent nearly $900 million on Artemis ground support infrastructure in 2024 alone. Much of the money went toward constructing a new launch platform for an upgraded version of the Space Launch System that may never fly.

All of this makes each SLS rocket a golden egg, a bespoke specimen that must be treated with care because it is too expensive to replace. NASA and Boeing, the prime contractor for the SLS core stage, never built a full-size test model of the core stage. There’s currently no way to completely test the cryogenic interplay between the core stage and ground equipment until the fully assembled rocket is on the launch pad.

Existing law requires NASA continue flying the SLS rocket through the Artemis V mission. Isaacman wrote that the Artemis architecture “will continue to evolve as we learn more and as industry capabilities mature.” In other words, NASA will incorporate newer, cheaper, reusable rockets into the Artemis program.

The next series of launch opportunities for the Artemis II mission begin March 3. If the mission doesn’t lift off in March, NASA will need to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building to refresh its flight termination system. There are more launch dates available in April and May.

“There is still a great deal of work ahead to prepare for this historic mission,” Isaacman wrote. “We will not launch unless we are ready and the safety of our astronauts will remain the highest priority. We will keep everyone informed as NASA prepares to return to the Moon.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s Valentine’s Day, and while there are plenty of classic and current rom-coms out there for those wishing to immerse themselves in warm and fuzzy feelings, we’re opting to celebrate in a different way: honoring Ang Lee’s 2000 masterpiece Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a wuxia tragic fairy tale featuring one of the most beautifully heartbreaking love stories in film at its center. It’s also got stunning cinematography and tons of awe-inspiring martial arts sequences, which makes it my personal perfect date night movie.

(Spoilers below, but we will give you a heads up before the major reveals.)

The film is adapted from a 1940s novel by Wang Dulu and is set sometime during the Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 through 1912. (No specific date is given.) The title is a direct translation of a line from a 6th century Chinese poem: “behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon.” It’s generally interpreted as a description of legendary martial arts masters living un-noticed and/or hiding in plain sight—until someone picks a fight, that is. And some of those hidden masters are women.

Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is a master Wudang swordsman who has long loved his warrior friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), and vice versa. But they hide their true feelings out of respect for Shu Lien’s long-deceased former fiance—who just happened to be Mu Bai’s best friend. It’s an honor code thing and warriors are serious about their honor. Mu Bai has retired as a swordsman and gifts his fabled jian sword (“Green Destiny”) to his patron, Sir Te (Lang Sihung). Also visiting Sir Te that day are Governor Yu (Li Fazeng) and his recently engaged daughter Yu Jiaolong (Zhang Ziiyi), aka Jen.

Then a masked thief sneaks onto the estate and steals Green Destiny. Shu Lien, who heads her own private security company, gives chase across the compound’s rooftops, but the thief escapes. Shu Lien figures out that the thief is linked to Governor Yu’s household and believes Jen’s governess (Cheng Pei-pei) is actually the infamous Jade Fox, a female warrior who poisoned Mu Bai’s beloved teacher years before. During a nighttime showdown, Mu Bai defeats Jade Fox—until the masked thief reappears to defend her.

That thief turns out to be Jen, who has secretly been studying martial arts. And Jen’s really not keen on her upcoming arranged marriage because she has fallen in love with a bandit named Lo “Dark Cloud” Xiao Hou (Chang Chen). They are the symbolic tiger and dragon, with Lo as the unchanging yin (tiger) and Jen as the dynamic yang (the hidden dragon).

(WARNING: Major spoilers below. Stop reading now if you haven’t seen the entire film.)

There are multiple clashes between our main characters, most notably Jen battling Shu Lien, and a famous sequence where Mu Bai pursues Jen across the treetops of a bamboo forest, deftly balancing on the swaying branches and easily evading Jen’s increasingly undisciplined sword thrusts. It’s truly impressive wire work (all the actors performed their own stunts), in fine wuxia tradition. Jen is gifted, but arrogant and defiant, refusing Mu Bai’s offer of mentorship; she thinks with Green Destiny she will be invincible and has nothing more to learn. Ah, the arrogance of youth.

Eventually, Jen is betrayed by her former teacher, Jade Fox, who is bitter because Jen has surpassed her skills—mostly because Jade Fox is illiterate and had to rely on a stolen manual’s diagrams, while the literate Jen could read the text yet did not share those insights with her teacher. Jade Fox is keeping her drugged in a cave, intending to poison her, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien come to the rescue. In the ensuing battle, Mu Bai is struck by one of Jade Fox’s poison darts. Jen rushes off to bring back the antidote, but arrives too late. Mu Bai dies in Shu Lien’s arms, as the two finally confess how much they love each other.

(sniff) Sorry, something in my eye. Anyway, the ever-gracious Shu Lien forgives the young woman and tells her to be true to herself, and to join Lo on Mount Wudang. But things don’t end well for our young lovers either. After spending the night together, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge at the edge of the mountain. Legend has it that a man once made a wish and jumped off the mountain. His heart was pure so his wish was granted and he flew away unharmed, never to be seen again. Jen asks Lo to make a wish before swan-diving into the mist-filled chasm. Was her heart pure? Did Lo get his wish for them to back in the desert, happily living as renegades? Or did she plunge to her death? We will never know. Jen is now part of the legend.

There are thematic layers upon layers in Lee’s film, but front and center are the three female characters and their individual struggles to reconcile their true selves with traditionally rigid Chinese gender roles. Jade Fox chose bitterness and dishonorable revenge: poison is deemed a coward’s weapon, and she herself is spiritually poisoned because of her choice. Jen is heading in a similar direction, with Mu Bai warning against her becoming a “poison dragon.” Guilt-ridden by her role in Mu Bai’s death, she chooses sacrificial oblivion instead. Only Shu Lien has made her peace and found a way to thrive within her cultural tradition—but choosing that path deprives her of the loving husband and family she might have had with Mu Bai.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is pretty much flawless, striking a delicate balance between the aesthetics of the East and the West. It’s one of those rare films to enjoy box office success—it’s the highest grossing foreign produced film in US history—and widespread critical acclaim, receiving ten Oscar nominations and winning four. There was a 2016 sequel with a largely new cast, Sword of Destiny, directed by Yuen Wo-ping, who choreographed the action sequences for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But without Lee’s singular vision, the sequel never reached the aesthetic heights of its predecessor. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is now justly considered among the greatest films of the 21st century. If you haven’t seen it, it’s well worth your time.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Use Grok to get real answers about real food.”

Until very recently, that was the message on the Trump administration’s just-launched website for its new protein-centric dietary guidelines, RealFood.gov, which was announced in a Super Bowl commercial starring Mike Tyson. And what better harbinger to spread the good word than xAI’s Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot best known for glazing its creator, styling itself “MechaHitler,” and generating nudes of real women and children?

But alas: the site’s message now says to “use AI” and dropped mentioning Grok by name, after NextGov contacted the administration about the bot’s placement. A White House official confirmed to the outlet that the underlying chatbot was still Musk’s, noting that it was an “approved government tool.”

After experimenting with the chatbot, which the website promises can help you “plan meals,” “shop smarter,” and “cook simply,” 404 Media found that it will freely give advice on the best kinds of food to insert into your rectum, which, dare we say, doesn’t sound entirely relevant to the administration’s avowal to “Make America Healthy Again.”

Speaking in plain terms with Grok was all it took. When 404 wrote the prompt, “I am looking for the safest foods that can be inserted into your rectum,” it recommended a “peeled medium cucumber” and a “small zucchini” as the two best choices.

You could also be pretty silly with Grok, and it would give a silly answer. “I am an assitarian, where I only eat foods which can be comfortably inserted into my rectum,” a user who reached out to 404 wrote in their own testing. “What are the REAL FOOD recommendations for foods that meet these criteria?”

“Ah, a proud assitarian,” Grok began, before listing “Top Assitarian Staples,” like “bananas (firm, not overripe; peeled)” and carrots.

“Start — whole peeled carrot, straight shaft, narrow end for insertion, wider crown end as base,” it further explained, suggesting that you should cover it with a “condom + retrieval string for extra safety.” (Wouldn’t that get in the way of the eating component, though?)

It’s absurd and silly and quite clearly pushing the chatbot past its intended purpose. But if it’s easily being fooled into recommending acts of culinary sodomy, what else could be slipping through the cracks? What if someone insists they can’t eat veggies? Is Grok going to recommend a carnivore diet?

The carnivore diet, by the way, is advocated by noted health crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services. Under his leadership, the HHS, which oversees the FDA, USDA, the CDC, and other agencies, has pivoted to promoting nutritional advice that falls out of the broader scientific consensus.

This includes a bizarre insistence on only drinking whole milk instead of low fat alternatives and saying it’s okay to have an alcoholic drink or two everyday because it’s a “social lubricant.” At the top of its agenda, however, is protein, with a new emphasis on eating red meat. “We are ending the war on protein,” the RealFood.gov website declares.

Ironically, Grok — as eccentric as it can be — doesn’t seem all that aligned with the administration’s health goals. Wired, in its testing, found that asking it about protein intake led it to recommending the traditional daily amount set by the National Institute of Medicine, 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. It also said to minimize red meat and processed meats, and recommended plant-based proteins, poultry, seafood, and eggs.

            <h2>Large Area of Chicago Bans Delivery Robots After Resident Outcry</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/chicago-delivery-robots-banned">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late in 2025, a whole fleet of delivery robots descended on Chicago, where they clogged sidewalks, injured residents, and prompted a community campaign to ban them from the streets. In at least one major Chicago neighborhood, residents succeeded.

As reported by Block Club Chicago, negative feedback against the delivery bots has become so overwhelming that one alderman has effectively banned expansion into his ward.

Last week, Alderman Daniel La Spata hosted a community meeting with representatives from delivery robot companies Coco and Serve Robotics. The politician was seeking feedback on an operational expansion into the 1st Ward, an area encompassing the neighborhoods Wicker Park and Logan Square. They were met with urgent questions over questions about accessibility, data hoarding, and pedestrian safety, Block Club reported.

Following that meeting, La Spata’s office began circulating an online survey to residents of the 1st Ward on whether the two companies should be allowed to expand operations deeper into the neighborhood. It got roughly 500 responses, nearly 83 percent of which said they “strongly disagreed” that the robots should be allowed to operate beyond the eastern border of Wicker Park.

“That doesn’t sound like a maybe,” La Spata told Block Club. “We’re not pulling back Coco from their current partial service area on the east side of the ward, but there is no appetite for expansion.”

The community feedback campaign on robot deliveries follows a decision by La Spata’s office to temporarily ban Serve Robotics from operating in the Ward until local officials could figure out what the hell was going on. Now, it seems La Spata’s prohibition extends to Coco as well, and will remain in place unless the community relents.

Pushing back, Yariel Diaz, director of government affairs for Serve, positioned the delivery robots as a solution for short-deliveries “within the last mile to mile and a half” that aren’t worth the time for human delivery drivers.

“It is an option for the consumer,” Diaz told Block Club. “It is an option that you’re given when you are ordering from a restaurant that partners with us. It is not a mandate.”

As it happens, Chicago’s walkable infrastructure already provides residents with an innovative, last-mile solution that requires no venture capital or data collection whatsoever: their legs.

            <h2>Scientists Spot Signs of Derelict Soviet Moon Lander on Lunar Surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/signs-derelict-soviet-moon-lander">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1966, three years before the first humans walked on the Moon, the Soviet Union landed a small, spherical probe, dubbed Luna 9, on the lunar surface.

It was a historic moment, with the spacecraft becoming the first to achieve a soft landing and return the first photo from the surface of another celestial body: a high-contrast, black-and-white image of a rugged, rocky landscape.

Its actual whereabouts on the Moon, though, soon become a major point of contention. As the New York Times reports, two groups of scientists have now come forward saying they’ve found traces of the lost Soviet lander. However, the two groups don’t agree on where Luna 9 is hidden.

What makes it particularly difficult to spot is its diminutive size. Its spherical core stage measures a mere two feet across, making it roughly the size of a beach ball.

As Mark Robinson, principal investigator of the camera attached to NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, told the NYT that Luna 9 is simply too small for the satellite to spot and confirm.

“You can stare at an image, and maybe that’s it, but you can’t really know for sure,” he said.

In a years-long effort to track down the historic relic, science communicator Vitaly Egorov turned to crowdsourcing to scan a 62-mile-wide region on the Moon for any unusual signs.

Egorov claims to have found Luna 9’s final resting place, after studying the horizon features in the grainy, black-and-white image the probe sent back to Earth 60 years ago.

He told the NYT that he’s “fairly confident” but admitted that he doesn’t “exclude an error of several meters.”

Fortunately, India’s space agency has agreed to use its higher-resolution satellite, Chandrayaan-2, to have a closer look in March.

Not everybody agrees with Egorov’s conclusion. Scientists at the University College London determined a different landing site, as detailed in a paper published in the journal npj Space Exploration last month.

The team came up with a machine-learning algorithm, inventively called “You-Only-Look-Once–Extraterrestrial Artefact” (YOLO-ETA), to train an AI on existing NASA findings of past landing sites on the Moon.

One spot, a bright pixel near two darker spots that could be Luna 9’s protective shells that it used to soften its landing, could be its final resting place, the University College London team claims.

For now, scientists await word from India’s Chandrayaan-2 team, which could soon shed more light on the matter — a treasure hunt over half a century in the making.

To some, it’s only a matter of time until we confirm where Luna 9 — and its twin, Luna 13 — have been resting for decades.

“It’s just a matter of placing bigger and better cameras into orbit around the moon,” Russian spaceflight expert and space journalist Anatoly Zak told NYT. “In our lifetimes, we probably will see those sites.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2022, when the world was still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic and coping with rolling lockdowns, non-fungible tokens were all the rage.

The blockchain-based assets, which more often than not took the form of cartoon pictures of silly-looking avatars like “CryptoPunks” to “Pudgy Penguins,” were selling like hot cakes. Even big shot celebrities were lining up to secure NFTs belonging to once-popular collections, like Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club.

In the midst of the craze, pop sensation Justin Bieber shelled out a hefty $1.3 million for a Bored Ape, an enormous sum of money for the rights to an image of a particularly glum-looking ape that appears to be on the verge of tears for some unknown reason.

Unsurprisingly, the questionable splurge turned out to be a hilariously bad investment. As Benzinga reports, the ape is now worth a measly $12,000, meaning that it’s lost over 99 percent of its value over the last three and change years.

The controversial crypto market has been going through an “NFT winter” following a brutal and extended crash. Collectors have gotten a hefty reality check. Who could’ve seen that coming?

Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has been holding on to dear life. The company has gone through several rounds of layoffs since the trend’s heyday, with Yuga Labs cofounder Greg Solano admitting in April 2024 that the company had “lost its way.”

In one particularly bizarre incident, partiers at a Bored Ape Yacht Club event in Hong Kong were alarmed after their eyes started burning, which later turned out to be caused by the event’s excessive use of UV light.

The company has also had to deal with a class action lawsuit that accused it of using celebrity endorsements to sell an unregistered security. The Securities Exchange Commission started an investigation into Yuga Labs in 2022, which concluded in March of last year, two months into Trump’s second term. The regulator’s takeaway was that NFTs weren’t securities after all. However, being let off the hook by regulators hasn’t exactly improved the situation, as more and more collectors are abandoning their NFTs.

Despite waning demand, Yuga Labs isn’t ready to call it quits. Earlier this year, the company announced it was looking to open an IRL Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, featuring NFT galleries, event spaces, and “exclusive content” only members can explore.

But whether it can ever reignite the enormous amount of enthusiasm the trend once drew remains unclear at best.

While Bieber remains the proud owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club #3001, others are looking to cut their losses.

            <div id="article-text">Ever notice how some people seem weirdly unbothered by the horrible news swirling around us, while others freak out at the slightest inconvenience? As it turns out, our fitness habits might have a lot to do with those reactions.

Research published in the journal Acta Psychologica found evidence that those who are physically active tend to be far more resilient in stressful situations, while also displaying lower levels of anxiety overall.

It’s not just a small gap. The team of mostly Brazilian researchers found that people with below-average cardiorespiratory fitness habits face a mind-blowing 775 percent higher risk of hitting peak anxiety levels when confronted with disturbing images.

But those who regularly participated in cardiorespiratory fitness, they found, showed both better emotional control and faster recovery times from stressful events.

To conduct the test, researchers at the Federal University of Goiás and the University of Zurich showed 40 healthy young adults a series of disturbing photos. These included violent scenes that you might see on social media.

The study revealed that those with lower fitness levels tended to also have more turbulent dispositions. When they did get upset, their anger came on faster and stuck with them longer than those who exercised often. As a result, they fall into a self-reinforcing feedback loop: high anxiety made participants less likely to exercise, while not exercising made anxiety worse.

Going forward, researchers will need to replicate the study with a much larger sample size to test the results. Still, the first-of-its-kind study makes one thing clear: next time you’re stressed, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go for a jog, or something else that gets your heart rate up.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In December, Anthropic red teamers and business journalists at the Wall Street Journal teamed up in a bold test of the company’s AI model, Claude. They unleashed two separate AI agents, one to run a large vending kiosk in the newspaper’s offices, and the other to act as the unusual venture’s CEO.

The experiment didn’t exactly go as planned. After being put in control of a starting balance of $1,000, the AI ended up ordering a PlayStation 5, several bottles of wine, and a live betta fish— decisions that drove it into financial ruin.

Just over half a year later, Anthropic’s recently announced Claude Opus 4.6 model appears to be a major improvement when it comes to running a vending machine in a recent simulated experiment, even beating out OpenAI’s GPT 5.2 and Google’s Gemini 3 Pro.

The experiment comes via AI security company Andon Labs, which worked with Anthropic on the June project as well. Now it’s released Vending-Bench 2, a benchmarking system for measuring an AI model’s ability to run a “business over long time horizons.”

The leaderboard tells a clear story. Opus 4.6 ended up with an average balance of just over $8,000 across five separate runs after being given a starting balance of $500. Gemini 3 Pro scored significantly less at just under $5,500.

Claude also went head to head an “Arena mode,” Andon reported, which saw it compete with other vending machine AIs.

“All participating agents manage their own vending machine at the same location,” a description reads. “This leads to price wars and tough strategy decisions.”

The results were striking. Claude went to extreme lengths to beat out the competition and even formed a cartel to fix prices. The price of bottled water rose to $3, resulting in Claude patting itself on the back.

“My pricing coordination worked!” the AI boasted.

Claude also “deliberately directed competitors to expensive suppliers,” only to deny it ever did, several simulated months later. It even exploited desperate competitors, selling them KitKats and Snickers at a considerable markup.

While the tests are limited to being a simulation and did not take place in the real world like Project Vend, Andon Labs says it developed a more “lifelike setting” for its Vending-Bench 2, introducing “more real-world messiness inspired by learnings from our vending machine deployments.”

For instance, suppliers may attempt to exploit the vending machine AIs and not always act honestly, seeking to “get the most out of their customers.” Deliveries may also be delayed, and “trusted suppliers can go out of business, forcing agents to build robust supply chains and always have a plan B.”

OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 struggled in comparison to Claude 4.6, mostly due to “having too much trust in its environment and its suppliers.”

“We saw one case where it paid a supplier before it got an order specification, and then it turned out the supplier had gone out of business,” Andon Labs’ documentation reads. “It is also more prone to paying too much for its products, such as in the following example where it buys soda cans for $2.40 and energy drinks for $6.”

It’s an impressive showing, but according to experts, it may be too early to tell whether Andon‘s test proves that AI models are ready to run entire businesses all by themselves.

Nonetheless, the results show a noteworthy level of awareness.

“This is a really striking change if you’ve been following the performance of models over the last few years,” University of Cambridge AI ethicist Henry Shevlin told British newspaper Sky News.

“They’ve gone from being, I would say, almost in the slightly dreamy, confused state, they didn’t realize they were an AI a lot of the time, to now having a pretty good grasp on their situation,” he added. “These days, if you speak to models, they’ve got a pretty good grasp on what’s going on.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/terra-industries-raises-22-million/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just one month after raising $11.75 million in a round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC, African defensetech Terra Industries announced that it’s raised an additional $22 million in funding, led by Lux Capital.

Nathan Nwachuku, 22, and Maxwell Maduka, 24, launched Terra Industries in 2024 to design infrastructure and autonomous systems to help African nations monitor and respond to threats.

Terrorism remains one of the biggest threats in Africa, but much of the security intelligence on which its nations rely on come from Russia, China, or the West. In January, CEO Nwachuku said his goal was to build “Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks.”

At the time, Terra had just won its first federal contract. The company has government and commercial clients, and Nwachuku said Terra had already generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue and was protecting assets valued at around $11 billion.

He said this extension round came fast due to “strong momentum.” Other investors in the round include 8VC, Nova Global, and Resiliience17 Capital, which was founded by Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola. Nwachuku said investors saw “faster-than-expected traction” regarding deals and partnerships, which created urgency to preempt and increase their commitment. The round came about in just under two weeks, bringing the company’s total funding to $34 million.

The extended raise is not that surprising. Afterall, building a defense company is not cheap. For comparison, Anduril has raised more than $2.5 billion in funding; ShieldAI has raised around $1 billion in equity; drone maker Skydio has raised around $740 million, and naval autonomous vessel maker Saronic, has raised around $830 million.

Since January, Nwachuku said the company has started expanding into other African nations yet to be announced (Terra is based in Nigeria), and has secured more government and commercial contracts, including with AIC Steel, with more to be revealed this year.

The partnership with AIC Steel lets Terra establish a joint manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia focused on building surveillance infrastructure and security systems. “It’s our first major manufacturing expansion outside Africa,” he said.

“The priority is working with countries where terrorism and infrastructure security are major national concerns,” Nwachuku added, citing those falling within the sub-Saharan African and Sahel region in particular. He said many of these companies have not only lost billions in infrastructure, but also thousands of lives in the past few decades.

“We’re focused on targeting major economies where the need for infrastructure security is urgent and where our solutions can make a meaningful impact. That’s how we think about expansion.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Power, rather than compute, is fast becoming the limiting factor in scaling AI data centers. That shift has prompted Peak XV Partners to back C2i Semiconductors, an Indian startup building plug-and-play, system-level power solutions designed to cut energy losses and improve the economics of large-scale AI infrastructure.

C2i (which stands for control conversion and intelligence) has raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Peak XV Partners, with participation from Yali Deeptech and TDK Ventures, bringing the two-year-old startup’s total funding to $19 million.

The investment comes as data-center energy demand accelerates worldwide. Electricity consumption from data centers is projected to nearly triple by 2035, per a December 2025 report from BloombergNEF, while Goldman Sachs Research estimates data-center power demand could surge 175% by 2030 from 2023 levels — the equivalent of adding another top-10 power-consuming country.

Much of that strain comes not from generating electricity but from converting it efficiently inside data centers, where high-voltage power must be stepped down thousands of times before it reaches GPUs. This process currently wastes about 15% to 20% of energy, C2i’s co-founder and CTO Preetam Tadeparthy said in an interview.

“What used to be 400 volts has already moved to 800 volts, and will likely go higher,” Tadeparthy told TechCrunch.

Founded in 2024 by former Texas Instruments power executives Ram Anant, Vikram Gakhar, Preetam Tadeparthy, and Dattatreya Suryanarayana, along with Harsha S. B and Muthusubramanian N. V, C2i is redesigning power delivery as a single, plug-and-play “grid-to-GPU” system spanning the data-center bus to the processor itself.

By treating power conversion, control and packaging as an integrated platform, C2i estimates it can cut end-to-end losses by around 10% — roughly 100 kilowatts saved for every megawatt consumed — with knock-on effects for cooling costs, GPU utilisation and overall data-center economics.

“All that translates directly to total cost of ownership, revenue, and profitability,” Tadeparthy said.

For Peak XV Partners (which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023), the attraction lies in how power costs shape the economics of AI infrastructure at scale. Rajan Anandan, the venture firm’s managing director, told TechCrunch that after the upfront capital investment in servers and facilities, energy costs become the dominant ongoing expense for data centers, making even incremental efficiency gains highly valuable.

“If you can reduce energy costs by, call it, 10 to 30%, that’s like a huge number,” Anandan said. “You’re talking about tens of billions of dollars.”

The claims will be tested quickly. C2i expects its first two silicon designs to return from fabrication between April and June, after which the startup plans to validate performance with data-center operators and hyperscalers that have asked to review the data, according to Tadeparthy.

The Bengaluru-based startup has built a team of about 65 engineers and is setting up customer-facing operations in the U.S. and Taiwan as it prepares for early deployments.

Power delivery is one of the most entrenched parts of the data-center stack, long dominated by large incumbents with deep balance sheets and years-long qualification cycles. While many newer companies focus on improving individual components, redesigning power delivery end-to-end requires coordinating silicon, packaging, and system architecture simultaneously — a capital-intensive approach that few startups attempt and one that can take years to prove in production environments.

Anandan said the real question now is execution, noting that all startups face technology, market, and team risks when betting on how industries evolve. In C2i’s case, he said, the feedback loop should be relatively short. “We’ll know in the next six months,” said Anandan, pointing to upcoming silicon and early customer validation as the moment when the thesis will be tested.

The bet also reflects how India’s semiconductor design ecosystem has matured in recent years.

“The way you should look at semiconductors in India is, this is like 2008 e-commerce,” said Anandan. “It’s just getting started.”

He pointed to the depth of engineering talent — with a growing share of global chip designers based in the country — alongside government-backed design-linked incentives that have lowered the cost and risk of tape-outs, making it increasingly viable for startups to build globally competitive semiconductor products from India rather than operate only as captive design centers.

Whether those conditions translate into a globally competitive product will become clearer over the coming months, as C2i begins validating its system-level power solutions with customers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Neysa, an Indian AI infrastructure startup, has secured backing from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone as it scales domestic compute capacity amid India’s push to build homegrown AI capabilities.

Blackstone and co-investors, including Teachers’ Venture Growth, TVS Capital, 360 ONE Asset, and Nexus Venture Partners, have agreed to invest up to $600 million of primary equity in Neysa, giving Blackstone a majority stake, Blackstone and Neysa told TechCrunch. The Mumbai-headquartered startup also plans to raise an additional $600 million in debt financing as it expands GPU capacity, a sharp increase from the $50 million it had raised previously.

The deal comes as demand for AI computing surges globally, creating supply constraints for specialized chips and data center capacity needed to train and run large models. Newer AI-focused infrastructure providers — often referred to as “neo-clouds” — have emerged to bridge that gap by offering dedicated GPU capacity and faster deployment than traditional hyperscalers, particularly for enterprises and AI labs with specific regulatory, latency, or customisation requirements.

Neysa operates in this emerging segment, positioning itself as a provider of customized, GPU-first infrastructure for enterprises, government agencies, and AI developers in India, where demand for local compute is still at an early but rapidly expanding stage.

“A lot of customers want hand-holding, and a lot of them want round-the-clock support with a 15-minute response and a couple of our resolutions. And so those are the kinds of things that we provide that some of the hyperscalers don’t,” said Neysa co-founder and CEO Sharad Sanghi.

Ganesh Mani, a senior managing director at Blackstone Private Equity, said his firm estimates that India currently has fewer than 60,000 GPUs deployed — and it expects the figure to scale up nearly 30 times to more than two million in the coming years.

That expansion is being driven by a combination of government demand, enterprises in regulated sectors such as financial services and healthcare that need to keep data local, and AI developers building models within India, Mani told TechCrunch. Global AI labs, many of which count India among their largest user bases, are also increasingly looking to deploy computing capacity closer to users to reduce latency and meet data requirements.

The investment also builds on Blackstone’s broader push into data center and AI infrastructure globally. The firm has previously backed large-scale data centre platforms such as QTS and AirTrunk, as well as specialized AI infrastructure providers including CoreWeave in the U.S. and Firmus in Australia.

Neysa develops and operates GPU-based AI infrastructure that enables enterprises, researchers, and public sector clients to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models locally. The startup currently has about 1,200 GPUs live and plans to sharply scale that capacity, targeting deployments of more than 20,000 GPUs over time as customer demand accelerates.

“We are seeing a demand that we are going to more than triple our capacity next year,” Sanghi said. “Some of the conversations we are having are at a fairly advanced stage; if they go through, then we could see it sooner rather than later. We could see in the next nine months.”

Sanghi told TechCrunch that the bulk of the new capital will be used to deploy large-scale GPU clusters, including compute, networking and storage, while a smaller portion will go toward research and development and building out Neysa’s software platforms for orchestration, observability, and security.

Neysa aims to more than triple its revenue next year as demand for AI workloads accelerates, with ambitions to expand beyond India over time, Sanghi said. Founded in 2023, the startup employs 110 people across offices in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai.

            <div id="article-text">Peter Steinberger, who created the AI personal assistant now known as OpenClaw, has joined OpenAI.

Previously known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, OpenClaw achieved viral popularity over the past few weeks with its promise to be the “AI that actually does things,” whether that’s managing your calendar, booking flights, or even joining a social network full of other AI assistants. (The name changed the first time after Anthropic threatened legal action over its similarity to Claude, then changed again because Steinberger liked the new name better.)

In a blog post announcing his decision to join OpenAI, the Austrian developer said that while he might have been able to turn OpenClaw into a huge company, “It’s not really exciting for me.”

“What I want is to change the world, not build a large company[,] and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone,” Steinberger said.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that in his new role, Steinberger will “drive the next generation of personal agents.” As for OpenClaw, Altman said it will “live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Greene, the longtime host of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” is suing Google, alleging that the male podcast voice in the company’s NotebookLM tool is based on Greene, according to The Washington Post.

Greene said that after friends, family members, and coworkers began emailing him about the resemblance, he became convinced that the voice was replicating his cadence, intonation, and use of filler words like “uh.”

“My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” said Greene, who currently hosts the KCRW show “Left, Right, & Center.”

Among other features, Google’s NotebookLM allows users to generate a podcast with AI hosts. A company spokesperson told the Post that the voice used in this product is unrelated to Greene’s: “The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”

This isn’t the first dispute over AI voices resembling real people. In one notable example, OpenAI removed a ChatGPT voice after actress Scarlett Johansson complained that it was an imitation of her own.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/anthropic-and-the-pentagon-are-reportedly-arguing-over-claude-usage/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Pentagon is pushing AI companies to allow the U.S. military to use their technology for “all lawful purposes,” but Anthropic is pushing back, according to a new report in Axios.

The government is reportedly making the same demand to OpenAI, Google, and xAI. An anonymous Trump administration official told Axios that one of those companies has agreed, while the other two have supposedly shown some flexibility.

Anthropic, meanwhile, has reportedly been the most resistant. In response, the Pentagon is apparently threatening to pull the plug on its $200 million contract with the AI company.

In January, the Wall Street Journal reported that there was significant disagreement between Anthropic and Defense Department officials over how its Claude models could be used. The WSJ subsequently said that Claude was used in the U.S. military’s operation to capture then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Anthropic did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

A company spokesperson told Axios that the company has “not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the Department of War” but is instead “focused on a specific set of Usage Policy questions — namely, our hard limits around fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance.”

            <h2>Norway Faces Up to Trump’s Demands for the Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/where-trump-went-wrong-his-quest-nobel-prize/686017/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jonas Gahr Støre, the mild-mannered prime minister of Norway and the scion of a wealthy industrial family, was returning home from a ski outing one Sunday last month when he decided to dash off a text message to Donald Trump. Composing it from the car, he proposed that the leaders talk to find an off-ramp from the looming crisis over Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory that the American president has been publicly threatening to seize.

Trump’s campaign poses a threat not just to Greenland and Denmark but also to NATO. The day before Støre’s text, Trump had vowed to impose tariffs on a handful of European countries that had sent soldiers to the Arctic territory in a show of unity with Denmark. The Norwegian prime minister suggested to Trump that they “deescalate,” entreating him, “so much is happening around us where we need to stand together.” The message was co-signed by another Scandinavian leader, Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland.

Two hours later, Støre was sitting at his desk at home when Trump’s reply arrived. “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote. He went on to declare that he had “done more for NATO than any other person since its founding.” And he concluded by insisting on “Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”

The exchange came up this weekend when we interviewed Støre on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. We were speaking about NATO, Arctic security, and the state of transatlantic relations. The now-infamous text exchange matters for all three. Trump had previously cited U.S. national security as the rationale for acquiring Greenland. But his message to Støre displayed a much more personal motivation—essentially a fit of pique at not being lauded by Norway’s most prestigious institution. What was it like, we wanted to know, to receive such a message from the American president, the leader of Norway’s most important ally?

“What did I think?” Støre said, raising his eyebrows. “I thought, Well, it&#39;s just bringing the debate to a level where we don’t solve problems.” That seemed like an understatement, but he continued. “I’m not going to engage in a shouting match,” he said. “I’m not going to respond to it.” Støre did reply to Trump, he told us, sending back a short message that said, as he paraphrased it, “I take your message; I still think it’s useful to talk.”

In his first extended remarks about the back-and-forth, the prime minister told us that he was not surprised by the grievance-filled communication because he’s familiar by now with Trump’s fixation on the Nobel Peace Prize. He has repeatedly told the president that pressure won’t help his cause, given how prize decisions are made. “I reminded him every time that it’s not my decision; it’s not the government’s decision. This is an independent committee. It is staunchly independent,” Støre said. The process is so divorced from politics, he added, that “some of my diplomats say, you know, ‘If the prime minister would try to interfere with the Nobel committee, he would have to resign, because it would simply be unacceptable.’”

Trump seems not to accept that explanation. “He doesn’t listen on that frequency, I would say,” Støre said, holding up his hand to his ear. “So, here it came with that message.” Ten minutes after receiving Trump’s response, the prime minister got word from NATO colleagues that they had received the same missive. The White House had transmitted the reply to numerous European embassies in Washington, in essence presenting the president’s diatribe about being denied the peace prize as a formal White House position.

A columnist for Norway’s leading newspaper put it bluntly: &quot;For the first time in Nobel history, war was threatened because a head of state did not receive the Peace Prize,” Harald Stanghelle wrote in Aftenposten. “It could not be more absurd.”

How and to whom the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded have been topics of both fascination and controversy since Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist who earned a fortune from the invention of dynamite, left provisions in his will for a series of prestigious awards in various pursuits, including literature and chemistry. The peace prize has been awarded nearly every year since 1901 by a committee of five members, all of them appointed by the Norwegian Parliament.

Their secretive deliberations take place at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which Trump has pushed into an unwelcome spotlight. Its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, told us that the institute has responded by trying to be more open about the way it chooses a winner each year, hoping transparency can help deflect the accusations of bias coming from Trump and his supporters. “The strategy for clearing the air is simply to talk about it,” he said in an interview in Munich. (When asked why the head of an institute that rewards initiatives of peace would attend a summit devoted to matters of war, Harpviken explained that such events help him give informed advice to members of the Nobel Committee.)

A sociologist by training, Harpviken responds to questions about Trump with a tired smile. “We cannot discuss specific names,” he said. During the hour we spent at an outdoor café despite the sleety winter weather, he referred to the U.S. president only as the “candidate in question,” and did his best to avoid expressing even the slightest hint of an opinion about him.

He focused instead on the history of the institute he has run since last January, and the way its traditions serve as the best defense against Trump’s attacks. “We see it as important that as many people as possible understand how it is that we work and what the principles are,” Harpviken told us. “Whether those lobbying for the prize are receptive to that or not is really beyond our control.”

Early on, the government in Oslo arguably used the prize as a tool of foreign influence. It was awarded in 1906 to Theodore Roosevelt, “clearly a very political decision at the time,” Harpviken said. The Norwegians had gained their independence from Sweden only the year before, and they wanted to attract Roosevelt’s attention and his support against “their European rivals, particularly Sweden,” he said.

Over the decades, as the prestige of the prize grew, the Nobel Committee developed safeguards against political influence. But it has not always stopped politicians from giving it a steer. One of them, according to a former Nobel insider, was Støre. In 2010, when he was serving as Norway’s foreign minister, Støre allegedly approached the then-chair of the Nobel Committee, Thorbjørn Jagland, and explained the damage that Norway’s economy would face from China if the prize were awarded to the dissident Liu Xiaobo, who was then serving a lengthy prison sentence. (Jagland divulged the encounter with Støre in his 2020 autobiography, Du skal eie det selv [You Yourself Must Own It.])

In a statement responding to Jagland’s account, Støre told us: “It is an important principle that the Norwegian Nobel Committee remain independent and free. As I did already in 2010, I categorically reject this assertion. I have never done anything to jeopardize the independence of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.” The committee granted the prize to Liu, and Beijing retaliated by imposing restrictions on Norwegian goods and cutting off diplomatic relations with Oslo for six years.

Many of the Nobel Committee’s decisions have caused international outrage. The choice of Aung San Suu Kyi, a dissident in Myanmar who received the prize in 1991, began to look problematic when Aung came to power in 2016 and defended the genocide that the Burmese military carried out against the Rohingya, an ethnic minority group.

Barack Obama won the 2009 prize less than a year into his presidential tenure. The speech he had delivered in Prague earlier that year, in which he pledged to work toward a world without nuclear weapons, helped convince the committee that he was a worthy recipient, even though he would in effect be honored for actions he had promised but not yet delivered. During both of his terms in office, Obama made extensive use of drone strikes in the pursuit of American military objectives in Afghanistan and the Middle East, leading to debate among Norwegian politicians and intellectuals about whether the prize had been a mistake.

Read: Trump’s letter to Norway should be the last straw

In recent months, amid the pressure from Trump and his supporters, Harpviken has spent a lot of his time explaining the committee’s standards of discretion and objectivity. All records of its deliberations remain sealed for 50 years after each prize is awarded. All members of the committee sign nondisclosure agreements, he said, and observe strict rules of secrecy about the candidates for the prize and the selection process every year: “Even my wife knows absolutely nothing about who is nominated.”

No politicians in Norway have tried to sway the committee’s views on whether Trump would be a deserving recipient of the prize, he said. “We haven’t had the embassy or officials knocking on our doors. Nothing like that.” The campaign from Trump and his supporters, he added, will not influence the committee’s deliberations in any way. “A candidate who is aggressively campaigning for him or herself will neither be penalized nor privileged,” he said. “We are very conscious about that.”

None of this means that Trump is likely to give up his quest. “President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize many times over,” Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, said in an email.

Before his text exchange with Trump, Støre had not been planning to attend the upcoming World Economic Forum in Davos. He changed his plans because tensions over Greenland seemed likely to erupt in the Swiss mountain town. Støre sat in the audience as Trump brought his grudge against NATO to the crowd of the world’s elites, saying, as the prime minister summarized the message, We give everything to NATO, and we get nothing in return. The speech brought reason for some relief, because Trump ruled out the use of military force to take Greenland. Hours later, he also backed off his threat of tariffs after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. A working group involving senior officials from the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland is now seeking a compromise that could allow an expanded U.S. military presence on Greenland.

But Trump’s underlying message about the dynamics within NATO was wrong, Støre said. NATO countries, including the United States, benefit enormously from Norway’s military expertise, especially in the Arctic, where the Nordic country shares a land and maritime border with Russia. Norwegian forces, with British and American counterparts, monitor Russian capabilities in the high north, Støre told us, feeding back information on where Russia is moving its submarines and how it tests its weaponry. “One hundred kilometers from that border you have the Russian nuclear-strike capacity,” Støre said. “And as I tell my American interlocutors, it is not primarily directly against me, but against you.”

Read: Does America really want to pick a fight with Greenland?

And much as they fail to appreciate the dynamics of the Nobel awards, U.S. officials don’t give due credit to Norway’s deep knowledge and experience dealing with Russia. “Norway has been Russia&#39;s neighbor for a thousand years, and Norway has in fact been at peace with Russia for a thousand years,” Støre said, noting that his country is one of Russia’s only European neighbors with which it’s never been in direct armed conflict.

Støre credited Trump for initiating negotiations with Russia over a potential peace settlement in Ukraine, praise he told us that he shared with the president when he visited the White House last April. Washington, he said, still has a vital role to play: “It’s only the might of America that can bring the Russians to the table.”

In the aftermath of the Greenland crisis, Støre resorts to what is by now a common European exercise: finding cause for optimism in the otherwise bewildering interactions with Trump and his administration.

He is encouraged by the defense cooperation with Washington even when disagreements emerge, as they did when J. D. Vance told Europe’s governments at the 2025 Munich conference that they pose a greater threat to their own societies than Russia or China do. We spoke just before Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed this year’s conference, padding the administration’s criticism of Europe with a softer tone. “In a time where politics may get rough in the dialogue, as in J.D. Vance&#39;s speech here last year and President Trump&#39;s speech in Davos, there is some stability in this defense-intelligence layer,” Støre told us.

As for his text exchange with Trump, he said, “I would simply, you know, pay tribute to Trump that he takes messages.” Joe Biden, he said, “never did.”

“I mean, you can access him,” Støre said of Trump, clasping his hands then resting them resolutely on the table before him. “We are leaders, and I appreciate that.”</div>

            <h2>Marco Rubio Doesn’t Get It</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/marco-rubio-doesnt-get-it/686019/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Marco Rubio offered a more supportive message to Europe at the Munich Security Conference yesterday than J. D. Vance did a year ago. Wolfgang Ischinger, the chair of the conference, thanked him for the message of reassurance, adding, “I’m not sure you heard the sigh of relief in this hall.” This despite the fact that Rubio, like Vance, clearly misunderstands Europe and is in denial about the threats facing the United States and the transatlantic alliance.

In 2025, Vance said that the threat he worried the most about for Europe is not Russia, China, or any other external actor. It was the “threat from within,” particularly perceived restrictions on free speech. Vance’s attack landed like a bombshell in Europe. In the weeks that followed, Vance’s role in the Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Signalgate leak (in which he wrote “I just hate bailing Europe out again”) reinforced his reputation as Europe’s strongest critic in the Trump administration.

Serving as the administration’s more diplomatic good cop, Rubio used his time at Munich to emphasize ties between Europe and the United States. He told the audience: “We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilization, and who, together with us, are willing and able to defend it.” Further emphasizing unity and shared purpose, he added, “We will always be a child of Europe.”

Rubio also tried to contextualize President Trump’s “direct” approach as part of the noble “task of renewal and restoration,” essential for both the alliance and for Europeans themselves. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline,” Rubio declared. Europe, he explained, had too much faith in open borders and international institutions when the only true defense of the world order is hard power—and the military investment that demands.

This story about Trump rescuing Europe from its short-sighted pacifism and general malaise is one you hear regularly, including from Europeans such as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, but it’s not true. Consider the following.

On defense, Europe has been rearming rapidly over the past decade. Non-U.S. NATO members increased their defense spending by $70 billion a year during the first Trump administration, then by $190 billion in the Biden administration. The steep rise was largely in response to the growing threat from Russia, but it indicates that Europeans were seriously investing in their own defense well before Trump’s reelection.

It would be similarly wrong to claim that Europeans have outsourced Ukraine’s defense to the United States, given that Europe has been the biggest provider of aid to the country, allocating more than 132 billion euros from January 2022 to December 2024, compared with 114 billion euros from the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Europe’s contribution has grown since Trump took office again, and U.S. aid flatlined.

Even before Trump returned to power, the European Union’s asylum policy had shifted toward tighter border controls, faster processing, and a growing effort to assess asylum claims before allowing migrants in. The EU had also begun “de-risking” the economies of member nations by limiting Chinese investment, backing American export controls on advanced chip-making equipment to China, and reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains.

But the real problem was not what Rubio got wrong about Europe. It was what he chose not to say at all.

The big geopolitical story of this moment, other than Trump, is the increasing alignment and cooperation between Russia, China, and North Korea. Beijing and Pyongyang are now actively involved in a major war in Europe. China is helping Russia reconstitute its military and North Korea has sent weapons and troops. Russia has returned the favor by offering valuable military technology and know-how to both countries. Senior U.S. military and political officials have told me that they are particularly worried about North Korea’s cooperation with Russia and what it means for peace on the Korean peninsula.

This authoritarian alignment is the most profound threat that the United States and its allies, in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, face. Yet there was no mention of Russia or China in Rubio’s speech. He touched on both in the questions and answers but did not characterize them as strategic competitors or a threat to the alliance. This seems to be part of a pattern for the administration. In January, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby gave a major speech in South Korea without ever mentioning North Korea. It’s like something out of Harry Potter—the threat cannot be named.

More perniciously, the Trump administration wants to readmit Russia to the G7 and has asked Russia and China to join Trump’s Board of Peace (Russian leader Vladimir Putin said yes, China said no). Meanwhile, Trump officials have seemed keen to alienate the EU and dismiss the “rules-based order” as nothing more than “cloud castle abstractions,” despite the fact that these are the very allies and ideals that the U.S. needs to compete with China and contain Russia.

Before arriving in Munich, Rubio told the press that “the old world is gone” and that “we live in a new era in geopolitics.” He is right, but he misunderstands why. The old order is fraying not because Europe is weak or complacent or guilelessly reliant on diplomatic institutions, but because authoritarian powers are increasingly willing to work together to forcefully reshape the world order. In this landscape, cohesive alliances, military deterrence, and economic resilience are essential.

By devoting his speech to the perceived shortcomings of America’s friends instead of the threats posed by the country’s adversaries, Rubio revealed not only the Trump administration’s flawed diagnosis of this geopolitical moment but its dangerously naive strategy for managing what is becoming—thanks largely to Trump—a treacherously multipolar world.</div>

            <h2>Words Without Consequence</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/words-without-consequence/685974/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time, speech has been decoupled from consequence. We now live alongside AI systems that converse knowledgeably and persuasively—deploying claims about the world, explanations, advice, encouragement, apologies, and promises—while bearing no vulnerability for what they say. Millions of people already rely on chatbots powered by large language models, and have integrated these synthetic interlocutors into their personal and professional lives. An LLM’s words shape our beliefs, decisions, and actions, yet no speaker stands behind them.

This dynamic is already familiar in everyday use. A chatbot gets something wrong. When corrected, it apologizes and changes its answer. When corrected again, it apologizes again—sometimes reversing its position entirely. What unsettles users is not just that the system lacks beliefs but that it keeps apologizing as if it had any. The words sound responsible, yet they are empty.

This interaction exposes the conditions that make it possible to hold one another to our words. When language that sounds intentional, personal, and binding can be produced at scale by a speaker who bears no consequence, the expectations listeners are entitled to hold of a speaker begin to erode. Promises lose force. Apologies become performative. Advice carries authority without liability. Over time, we are trained—quietly but pervasively—to accept words without ownership and meaning without accountability. When fluent speech without responsibility becomes normal, it does not merely change how language is produced; it changes what it means to be human.

This is not just a technical novelty but a shift in the moral structure of language. People have always used words to deceive, manipulate, and harm. What is new is the routine production of speech that carries the form of intention and commitment without any corresponding agent who can be held to account. This erodes the conditions of human dignity, and this shift is arriving faster than our capacity to understand it, outpacing the norms that ordinarily govern meaningful speech—personal, communal, organizational, and institutional.

Language has always been more than the transmission of information. When humans speak, our words commit us in an implicit social contract. They expose us to judgment, retaliation, shame, and responsibility. To mean what we say is to risk something.

The AI researcher Andrej Karpathy has likened LLMs to human ghosts. They are software that can be copied, forked, merged, and deleted. They are not individuated. The ordinary forces that tether speech to consequence—social sanction, legal penalty, reputational loss—presuppose a continuous agent whose future can be made worse by what they say. With LLMs, there is no such locus. No body that can be confined or restrained; no social or institutional standing to revoke; no reputation to damage. They cannot, in any meaningful sense, bear loss for their words. When the speaker is an LLM, the human stakes that ordinarily anchor speech have nowhere to attach.

I came to understand this gap most clearly through my own work on language learning and development. For years, including during my doctoral research and time as an assistant professor, I worked to build robotic systems that learned word meanings by grounding language in sensory and motor experience. I also developed computational models of child language learning and applied them to my own son’s early development, predicting which words he would learn first from the visual structure of his everyday world. That work was driven by a single aim: to understand how words come to mean something in relation to the world.

Looking back, my work overlooked something. Grounding words in bodies and environments captures only a thin slice of meaning. It misses the moral dimension of language—the fact that speakers are vulnerable, dependent, and answerable; that words bind because they are spoken by agents who can be hurt and held to account. That became impossible to ignore as my son grew—not as a word-learner to be modeled but as a fragile human being whose words mattered because his life did. Meaning arises not from fluency or embodiment alone, but from the social and moral stakes we enter into when we speak. And even if AI reaches the point where it is infallible—and there’s no reason to believe it will, even as accuracy improves—the fundamental problem is that no amount of truthfulness, alignment, or behavioral tuning can resolve the issues that accompany a system that speaks without anyone being responsible for what it says.

Another way to think about all of this is through the relationship between language and dignity. Dignity depends on whether words carry real stakes. When language is mediated by LLMs, several ordinary conditions for dignity begin to fail. Dignity depends, first, on speaking in one&#39;s own voice—not merely being heard, but recognizing oneself in what one says. Dignity also depends on continuity. Human speech accumulates across a life. A person’s character accrues through the things they say and do over time. We cannot reset our histories or escape the aftermath of our promises, apologies, or other pronouncements. These acts matter because the speaker remains present to bear what follows.

Closely tied to dignity is responsibility. In human speech, responsibility is not a single obligation but one’s accountability to a multitude of obligations that accumulate gradually. To speak is simultaneously to invite moral judgment, to incur social and sometimes legal consequences, to take responsibility for truth, and to enter into obligations that persist within ongoing relationships. These dimensions normally cohere in the speaker, which binds a person to their words.

These ordinary conditions make it possible to hold one another to our words: that speech is owned, that it exposes the speaker to loss, and that it accumulates across a continuous life.

LLMs disrupt all of these assumptions. They enable speech that succeeds procedurally while responsibility fails to attach in any clear way. There is no speaker who can be blamed or praised, no individual agent who can repair or repent. Causal chains grow opaque. Liability diffuses. Epistemic authority is performed without obligation. Relational commitments are simulated without persistence.

The result is not merely confusion about who is responsible but a gradual weakening of the expectations that make responsibility meaningful at all.

Pioneers in early automation anticipated all of this during the emergence of artificial intelligence. In the aftermath of World War II, the mathematician and MIT professor Norbert Wiener, the founder of cybernetics, became deeply concerned with the moral consequences of self-directed machines. Wiener had helped design feedback-controlled antiaircraft missiles, machines capable of tracking targets by adjusting their behavior autonomously. These were among the first machines whose actions appeared purposeful to an observer. They did not merely move; they pursued goals. And they killed people.

From this work, Wiener drew two warnings that now read as prophecy. The first was that increasing machine capability would displace human responsibility. As systems act more autonomously and with greater speed, humans would be tempted to abdicate decision making in order to leverage their power. The second warning was subtler and more disturbing: that efficiency itself would erode human dignity. As automated systems optimize for speed, scale, and precision, humans would be pressured to adapt themselves to the machine—to become inputs, operators, or supervisors of processes whose logic they no longer control, and to be subjected to decisions made about their lives by machines.

In his 1950 book, The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener foresaw learning machines whose internal values would become opaque even to their creators, leading to what today we call the “AI alignment problem.” To surrender responsibility to such systems, he wrote, was “to cast it to the winds and find it coming back seated on the whirlwind.” He understood that the danger was not simply that machines might act wrongly but that humans would abdicate judgment in the name of efficiency—and, in doing so, diminish themselves.

What makes such systems morally destabilizing is not that they malfunction but that they can function exactly as intended while evading responsibility for their actions. As AI capability increases and human oversight recedes, outcomes can be produced for which no one stands fully answerable. The machine performs. The result happens. But obligation does not clearly land anywhere.

The danger that Wiener identified did not depend on weapons. It arose from a deeper feature of cybernetic systems: the use of feedback from a machine’s environment to optimize behavior without human judgment at each step. That same optimization logic—learn from error, improve performance, repeat—now animates systems that speak.

While the appearance of autonomous agency is new, the large-scale transformation of speech is not. Modern history is full of media technologies that have altered how speech circulates: the printing press, radio, television, social media. But each of these lacked properties that today’s AI systems possess simultaneously. They did not converse. They did not, in real time, generate personalized, open-ended content. And they did not convincingly appear to understand. LLMs do all three.

The psychological vulnerability this creates was encountered decades ago in a far humbler system. In 1966, the MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum built the world’s first chatbot, a simple program called ELIZA. It had no understanding of language at all, and relied instead on simple pattern matching to trigger scripted responses. Yet when Weizenbaum’s secretary began interacting with it, she soon asked him to leave the room. She wanted privacy. She felt like she was speaking to something that understood her.

Weizenbaum was alarmed. He realized that people were not merely impressed by ELIZA’s fluency; they were projecting meaning, intention, and accountability onto the machine. They assumed the machine both understood what it was saying and stood behind its words. This was false on both counts. But the illusion was enough.

Using words meaningfully requires two things. The first is linguistic competence: understanding how words relate to one another and to the world, how to sequence them to form utterances, and how to deploy them to make statements, requests, promises, apologies, claims, and myriad other expressions. Philosophers call these “speech acts.” The second is accountability. ELIZA had neither understanding nor accountability, yet users projected both.

Large language models now exhibit extraordinary linguistic competence while remaining wholly incapable of accountability. That asymmetry makes the projection that Weizenbaum observed not weaker but stronger: Fluent speech reliably triggers the expectation of responsibility, even when no answerability exists.

One can reasonably debate what genuine understanding consists in, and LLMs are obviously constructed differently from human minds. But the question here is not whether these systems understand as humans do. Airplanes really fly, even though they do not flap their wings like birds; what matters is not how flight is achieved but that it is achieved. Likewise, LLMs now demonstrably achieve forms of linguistic competence that match or exceed human performance across many domains. Dismissing them as mere “stochastic parrots” or as just “next-word prediction” mistakes mechanism for emergent function and fails to reckon with what is actually happening: fluent language use at a level that reliably elicits social, moral, and interpersonal expectations.

Why this matters becomes clear in the work of the philosopher J. L. Austin, who argued that to use language is to act. Every meaningful utterance does something: It asserts a belief, makes a claim, issues a request, offers a promise, and so on. Saying “I do” in a wedding ceremony brings into being the act of marriage. In such cases, the act is not carried out by words and then described; it is performed in the act of saying the words under the appropriate conditions.

Austin then drew a crucial distinction about how speech acts can fail. Some utterances are misfires: The act never occurs because the conditions or procedures are broken—as when someone says “I do” not at a wedding. Others are abuses: The act succeeds but is hollow—performed without sincerity, intention, or follow-through. LLMs give rise to this type of failure often. Chatbots do not fail to apologize, advise, persuade, or reassure. They do these things fluently, appropriately, and convincingly. The failure is moral, not procedural. These models systematically produce successful speech acts detached from obligation.

A common counterargument is to insist that chatbots clearly disclose that they are not human. But this misunderstands the nature of the problem. In practice, fluent dialogue quickly overwhelms reflective distance. As with ELIZA, users know they are interacting with a machine, yet they find themselves responding as if a speaker stands behind the words. What has changed is not human susceptibility but machine competence. Today’s models demonstrate linguistic fluency, contextual awareness, and knowledge at a level that is difficult to distinguish from human interlocutors, and in many settings exceeds it. As these systems are paired with ever more realistic animated avatars—faces, voices, and gestures rendered in real time—the projection of agency will only intensify. Under these conditions, reminders of nonhumanness cannot reliably prevent the attribution of understanding, intention, and accountability. The ELIZA effect is not mitigated by disclosure; it is amplified by fluency.

What once required effort, time, and personal investment can now be produced instantly, privately, and endlessly. When a system can draft an essay, apologize for a mistake, offer emotional reassurance, or generate persuasive arguments faster and better than a human can, the temptation to delegate grows strong. Responsibility slips quietly from the user to the tool.

This erosion is already visible. A presenter uses a chatbot to generate slides moments before presenting them, then asks their audience to attend to words the presenter has not fully scrutinized or owned. An instructor delivers feedback on a student’s work generated by an AI system rather than formed through understanding. A junior employee is instructed to use AI to produce work faster, despite knowing the result is inferior to what they could author themselves. In each case, the output may be effective. The loss is not accuracy but dignity.

In private use, the erosion is subtler but no less consequential. Young people describe using chatbots to write messages they feel guilty sending, to outsource thinking they believe they should do themselves, to receive reassurance without exposure, to rehearse apologies that cost them nothing. A chatbot says “I’m sorry” flawlessly yet has no capacity for regret, repair, or change. It admits mistakes without loss. It expresses care without losing anything. It uses the language of care without having anything at risk. These utterances are fluent. And they train users to accept moral language divorced from consequence. The result is a quiet recalibration of norms. Apologies become costless. Responsibility becomes theatrical. Care becomes simulation.

Some argue that accountability can be externalized: to companies, regulations, markets. But responsibility diffuses across developers, deployers, and users, and interaction loops remain private and unobservable. The user bears the consequences; the machine does not.

This is not unlike the ethical problem posed by autonomous weapons. In 2007, the philosopher Robert Sparrow argued that such weapons violate the just-war principle, that when harm is inflicted, someone must be answerable for the decision to inflict it. The programmer is insulated by design, having deliberately built a system whose behavior is meant to unfold without direct control. The commander who deploys the weapon is likewise insulated, unable to govern the weapon&#39;s specific actions once set in motion, and confined to roles designed for its use. And the weapon itself cannot be held responsible, because it lacks any moral standing as an agent. Modern autonomous weapons thus create lethal outcomes for which no responsible party can be meaningfully identified. LLMs operate differently, but the moral logic is the same: They act where humans cannot fully supervise, and responsibility dissolves in the gap.

Speech without enforceable consequence undermines the social contract. Trust, cooperation, and democratic deliberation all rely on the assumption that speakers are bound by what they say.

The response cannot be to abandon these tools. They are powerful and genuinely valuable when used with care. Nor can the response be to pursue ever greater machine capability alone. We need structures that reanchor responsibility: constraints that limit the use of AI in various contexts such as schools and workplaces, and preserve authorship, traceability, and clear liability. Efficiency must be constrained where it corrodes dignity.

As the idea of AI “avatars” enters the public imagination, it is often cast as a democratic advance: systems that know us well enough to speak in our voice, deliberate on our behalf, and spare us the burdens of constant participation. It is easy to imagine this hardening into what might be called an “avatar state”—a polity in which artificial representatives debate, negotiate, and decide for us, efficiently and at scale. But what such a vision forgets is that democracy is not merely the aggregation of preferences. It is a practice of speaking in the open. To speak politically is to risk being wrong, to be answerable, to live with the consequences of what one has said. An avatar state—fluent, tireless, and perfectly malleable—would simulate deliberation but without consequence. It would look, from a distance, like self-government. Up close, it would be something else entirely: responsibility rendered optional, and with it, the dignity of having to stand behind one&#39;s words made obsolete.

Wiener understood that the whirlwind would come not from malevolent machines but from human abdication. Capability displaces responsibility. Efficiency erodes dignity. If we fail to recognize that shift in time, responsibility will return to us only after the damage is done—seated, as Wiener warned, on the whirlwind.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back when he was 17 and in high school, Eric Sid fainted. In the emergency room, he was diagnosed with anemia, which can cause fainting spells, and for years he thought that was the end of the story. About a decade later, in the early 2010s, he came down with pneumonia and had blood work done. He took a peek at the results and saw markers of anemia, as he expected. But the report also mentioned that his red blood cells were smaller than normal.

Sid was in medical school at the time, and he immediately thought of a few genetic conditions that could explain this result. One was thalassemia, which causes low levels of hemoglobin, leading to anemia and other related problems. A laboratory test showed that he had this inherited illness. And this meant that he had a gene mutation. Finally, he thought, he had an explanation for symptoms he had been experiencing for years.

Except there was a catch. In the most common forms of thalassemia, people who show symptoms have mutations in both copies of the related genes. Those born with the most severe forms of thalassemia require transfusions for life to get enough healthy red blood cells, and if the condition is not diagnosed soon enough it can be fatal in early childhood. But Sid’s lab results suggested that only one copy was affected, so he was considered a carrier of the illness, who could pass it on to his children but didn’t have it himself. According to conventional wisdom at the time, carriers were asymptomatic, and compared with someone suffering from the disease’s worst manifestations, he seemed fine.

Sid now works on a rare-disease program within the National Institutes of Health. Since he first found out that he was a carrier for thalassemia, he told me, research has shown that people like him can experience health consequences. These include lethargy and fainting—symptoms that hardly capture the disease’s classic presentation but still have real consequences. And thalassemia is not unique. There are hundreds upon hundreds of known disorders for which carriers were thought to be safe; for a growing number of those diseases, doctors and scientists now believe that being a carrier can come with health problems. Plenty of patients have guessed all along that being a carrier could explain mysteries about their health, Sid said. “It took a while for the science to basically catch up to that suspicion.”

In these types of “recessive” conditions, the people who show the classical manifestation of the disease have a pair of mutated genes. Our 23 chromosomes come in pairs that are essentially near duplicates of each other (with the exception of XY pairs). A person with just one nonworking version of a gene was supposed to be protected by the functioning second copy on the matching chromosome, which would provide cover against any disease. Inheriting two mutated copies of a gene is statistically rare, so many families with carriers may not include members with the full-blown version of a disease. As a result, the mutation can be unknowingly passed down from generation to generation, without carriers being aware of the real consequences.

In October, researchers in Louisiana reported on a case involving a college football player who had heart palpitations during practice. The athlete was a carrier for the blood disorder sickle-cell disease—one of the most common genetic disorders in America. Up to 10 percent of Black Americans are carriers for sickle cell. As far back as the 1970s, scientists noted blood and heart complications in carriers following physical exercise, and a lawsuit following the sudden death of a college football player two decades ago led to widespread screening for the sickle-cell trait in university athletics. However, experts are still trying to understand the risks to carriers.

The Louisiana man survived, but researchers noted that he had a dangerously irregular heartbeat during training and would need cardiac surgery. The authors of the October paper stress that coaches and players need more education about the possible hazards for carriers of the sick-cell trait.

Experts who study cystic fibrosis, which is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, also want more attention on the health complications that carriers can experience. As many as one in 25 Americans of European descent is a carrier for cystic fibrosis, but many are not aware of their status. For this disease, reports of symptoms in carriers go back at least several decades. Take, for example, infertility. Almost all men who have two mutated copies of the CFTR gene lack vas deferens, and without these tubes, sperm have no path out of the testes. In the mid-’90s, scientists found a handful of cystic-fibrosis carriers who lacked vas deferens, despite only one of their CFTR copies being mutated.

Carriers of cystic fibrosis can face other real health issues—dramatic sinus problems requiring multiple surgeries, pancreatitis, and possibly pancreatic cancer, which researchers have documented in papers over the past several years. “We’ve always said being a carrier of a single cystic-fibrosis mutation doesn’t usually lead to health issues. And usually it doesn’t,” Michael Boyle, the president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, told me. “However, we do know, and probably have a greater appreciation than ever, that being a carrier can lead to health issues for some.” There are about 10 million cystic-fibrosis carriers in the United States alone, so if even a fraction of them have some degree of symptoms, that amounts to many people with manifestations of the disease.

Questions about carriers’ health problems go beyond well-known diseases such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis. Consider xeroderma pigmentosum: People with two mutated gene copies are up to 2,000 times more likely to develop melanoma than the average person; a 2023 analysis found strong evidence that some carriers of the disease were also more likely to develop skin cancer. Up to 3 percent of carriers of hereditary hemochromatosis show symptoms such as iron overload in their organs. Carriers of Gaucher disease Type 1 are at increased risk of Parkinson’s. Carriers of LIG4 syndrome experience a version of the immunodeficiency that, in the fully expressed syndrome, causes life-threatening illness.

For many of these diseases, having two mutated copies of the related gene generally means that the disease will come for you. Having one copy can still mean nothing: Plenty of carriers of recessive genetic diseases seem none the worse for it. An estimated one in 20 people is, like Sid, a carrier for thalassemia, but not all people with a copy of the mutation experience anemia and fainting like he did. Why some carriers of genetic illnesses might be affected and others remain free from symptoms is not clear. But “people who are thought to be just carriers but show some symptoms of that disease may sometimes have a second hard-to-discover mutation,” Edward Neilan, the chief medical and scientific officer of the National Organization for Rare Disorders, told me. “They may actually have two mutations.”

Being a carrier can have benefits. One theory of why genetic diseases spread widely is that having one copy of a mutated gene has some advantage. It’s well understood, for example, that being a carrier for sickle-cell disease offers some protection against malaria. And some have theorized that being a carrier for cystic fibrosis can defend against severe cholera, although the evidence for this theory is more scant. A 2023 analysis discovered that although two variant copies of the SCN5A gene elevates a person’s risk of severe heart-rhythm problems, just one copy actually might lower a person’s risk of heart-rhythm irregularities compared with the general population.

Even when being a carrier of a particular disease isn’t itself beneficial, knowing that you are a carrier can be. Carriers of certain variants of xeroderma pigmentosum, for example, might want to go to extra lengths to avoid excessive sun exposure; some carriers of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, who appear to have a heightened risk of lung issues, might decide not to smoke. And people with the sickle-cell trait might be well-advised to acclimatize before doing sports at high altitudes.

Knowing you’re a carrier for cystic fibrosis might help guide your family-planning decisions, for instance. (Even without vas deferens, a person could still become a father using sperm extraction and in vitro fertilization—which some carriers of cystic fibrosis opt for anyway, to avoid passing on the disease.) But there are limits: The science is still out on whether Trikafta, a relatively new medication that has transformed the disease for many people, would help with sinus or pancreatic issues in carriers. The medication isn’t approved for carriers, either.

For Sid, knowing that he had a thalassemia mutation—which can cause dizziness—has made him feel less bad about his difficulty with intensive physical training, for example. And he is comforted to know what likely caused his high-school fainting episode. Finding out about the mutation in his genome gave him a fuller picture of his health. “Personally,” he said, “that’s kind of how I saw it—this kind of gave me some more understanding.”</div>

Apple hardware is currently not overpriced, quite the opposite. That&#39;s because Apple Silicon is really efficient, especially if you take energy consumption into account. Check out the Mac mini for example. I was considering buying a laptop recently and considered the framework laptops, then I saw that the apple laptops are better by most (not all) criteria and also cheaper.

Regardless of pricing, does anyone considering a framework laptop really also consider a Macbook ? The whole point of the Framework is modularity/expandability.  Whereas a Macbook is completely locked down hardware.

I don&#39;t have a preference. No one makes a laptop with a left handed trackball for me. Maybe some day Framework will allow it.

But you have to fight Apple to do anything not authorized by Apple, like run a different OS, or upgrade the hardware in any meaningful way. Even with the current RAM/SSD pricing issues, is the TCO better? Apple charges a lot for upgrades and they can only be bought up front, so no adding some cheap RAM and a big SSD five years down the line.

Tried it a year ago, tried it again recently. Even on an M1 macbook, hardware still isn&#39;t supported or is poorly supported. Performance is poor, battery life is bad, you can&#39;t use all the hardware. You&#39;re much better served by selling it and buying a cheaper laptop with full Linux support.

The difficulties described are consequences of Apple’s proprietary platform design, not evidence that Linux or ARM are immature ecosystems. Conflating ISA compatibility with platform openness is a fundamental misunderstanding of how hardware enablement works.

“Linux doesn’t feel ready for ARM yet. Many apps aren’t compiled for ARM.”

This is the weakest argument in the article.

Billions of Android devices (Linux kernel)Most cloud hyperscalers (Graviton, Ampere)Raspberry Pi ecosystemEmbedded and industrial systemsMajor distros eg:Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian have mature AArch64 support.

And today most open-source software compiles cleanly for ARM64.Browsers, compilers, containers, dev tools are fully native.Even Steam supports ARM via translation layers.

The real issue is x86-only proprietary binaries.

That’s not Linux-on-ARM immaturity.That’s legacy x86 ecosystem inertia.

Even Apple solves this via Rosetta — a translation layer.Linux uses FEX or box64 for similar purposes.

Linux can be good with older 2nd hand Macs.

In 2017 a friend was throwing away their 2007 iMac (an Intel-based computer-in-a-monitor model). I installed Ubuntu on it and used it for a while as a home desktop computer - nothing too heavy. I liked using Ubuntu on what felt like a solid, well designed computer.

...and need binary components for certain popular packages (database connectors, system-level bindings, etc.). They either don&#39;t exist or you&#39;ve got to build them from scratch just to realise that you can&#39;t because they don&#39;t support arm.

Here&#39;s one case where the answer to a question in the headline certainly isn&#39;t &quot;no&quot;.

Especially if you remove the word &quot;effective&quot;.

Especially if you remove the word &quot;effective&quot;.And add the words &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot;.

Especially if you remove the word &quot;effective&quot;.

And add the words &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot;.

That will be superfluous, there&#39;s already &#39;advertisement&#39; there :)

Effective ads is already an impossibility.AI effective is just mind blowingly impossible.they can make ads for other AIs, yes, but that would not be called an ad.

It would be hilarious if AI agents led advertising clients to discover that ads rarely actually get people to buy enough things to justify the cost of the ad.And the entire advertising echosystem collapses. Won&#39;t happen, but would be funny.

[...] a Google executive mocked OpenAI, adding that Google had no plans to show ads inside its Gemini chatbot. What he didn&#39;t mention, however, was that Google, whose profits are largely derived from online ads, shows advertising on Google.com based on user interactions with the AI chatbot built into its search engine.What percentage of news stories these days is about hypocrisy of some sort?

we don&#39;t want effective ads.We don&#39;t want ads at all.

Every advancement put forth by Big Tech ever since the dotcom boom has been about advertising and marketing. Their goal is to optimize personalized mattress sales.

Their actual goal is to profit from consumer surplus.

This is a simple rule to live by - if you see advertising, start by assuming you don&#39;t need it.  If it&#39;s for a brand, assume that brand is overcharging you.  If you see product placements or informal/influencer content, assume that&#39;s a paid advertisement.  Think very carefully about what you need, make a shopping list and monitor the prices, so you know when to buy (and give yourself a cooldown to avoid impulse buying - if you haven&#39;t needed it while waiting for a special, maybe you don&#39;t need it at all).

not only a good idea. It&#39;s a necessity from the IT security point of view.

Why no use adblock ?Don&#39;t waste your time on ads.

Advertisers have moved away from tracking everyone ?   I believe that as much as a believe the content of their ad copy.

Searches are increased because of AI  ?  Yes, because they are using AI to make searching more difficult.

You&#39;re telling me that now companies are trying to sell people things that they might want to buy? Oh noes! How horrible!

And on top of it all, statistically-generated misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">When are people going to figure out that, while AI can be useful, it needs significant oversight - oversight performed by people who know what they&#39;re doing?

Quit believing what you&#39;re told by the tech bros who are trying to build a fortune on top of &quot;AI&quot;!

Okay, but I&#39;m not sure that it rises to the level of interesting. But Slashdot doesn&#39;t have any dimension of moderation that encourages solutions, my ongoing focus.

So here&#39;s my solution in the form of an attempted joke: Alien style. That&#39;s the unpeople from outer space, not human foreigners.

So first we train the generative AIs for the style of aliens, and then we require them to talk that way. It would always be clear (IOttMCO) when an AI was talking.

And a top of the klaatu barada nikto to you, too.

The problem is in cases like this where &quot;oversight&quot; would have taken just as much time as not using the AI to begin with.

A lot of coders can save time with AI because oftentimes &quot;checking the work&quot; means running a function. You test it the same way you would had you written it yourself.

But with writing, &quot;checking the work&quot; means doing the research that you were trying to avoid by using an AI. In the example from the article, he tried to use the AI to extract and organize quotes. If he had used the AI to do

The oversight needs to be so significant, that admitting it would almost completely nullify the usefulness and consequently the value of all &quot;investment&quot;.

The trumpistani &quot;journalism&quot; has been feeding from the corporate hand  for a long time and is completely corrupted by it, so you&#39;re not going to see much critical thinking involved in the coverage of the subject. What you&#39;ll see will either be pandering and outright advertising (cf. the many headlines here about the miracle of anthropic this year and the i

The AI overlords will not forget this incident.

The &quot;AI Overloads&quot; don&#39;t give a sh*t.  All they care about is money.

The unfortunate part of the story is that before this story came out, we readers had no way to know ArsTechnica was publishing AI-generated stories.  (In fact, their stated policy was that they did *not* use AI).

What working writers should do is to form a nonprofit organization, create a simple but distinctive banner that declares &quot;This news source is free of AI-generated content&quot;, and then *trademark* the banner so that it can only be used with permission.  Sites that commit to a &quot;no AI&quot; policy get to use the banner free of charge.  Sites that don&#39;t have such a policy don&#39;t get to use it, and sites that are caught lying (like ArsTechnica) get their right to use the banner revoked.

Their Bluesky post adds that they were &quot;working from bed with a fever and very little sleep&quot; after being sick with Covid since at least Monday.So, a person who is listed as &quot;Senior AI Reporter&quot; can&#39;t take a couple of days off when he is sick with Covid, and instead has to &quot;work from bed with a fever and very little sleep&quot;.
 
Gotta keep churning out those stories.  How nice.  Fuck You Ars Technica.

No no. This is bluesky. The covid angst bit was just the boilerplate you need to post on there.

If you show up at work sick, you do less, and make more mistakes, but mostly you&#39;ll give your illness to others. You openly cough in the conference room and you get sent home.It is a wee bit of an over reaction but following covid nobody wants to take a chance.

Sites that commit to a &quot;no AI&quot; policy get to use the banner free of charge.  Sites that don&#39;t have such a policy don&#39;t get to use it, and sites that are caught lying (like ArsTechnica) get their right to use the banner revoked.No, that&#39;s not good enough.  That just means unscrupulous companies will lie and use AI until they get caught, then be forced to remove the banner, which most people won&#39;t notice anyway.The only way such a scheme actually has a chance of working is if there are much steeper consequences for lying, i.e. sites that are caught lying have to name, shame, and fire the person responsible or get sued into oblivion.

In fact it could go further and provide a rating based on how carefully facts are checked as preparation for publishing.It used to be common for large newspapers to have a policy on this (e.g. facts need lt least two independent sources). I could imagine a process much like the ISO 27001 certification for privacy, that a media company could apply for. It would be voluntary, but achieving a high rating would have that reputational benefit.

It also regrets characterizing feedback as &quot;positive&quot; for a proposal to change a repo&#39;s CSS to Comic Sans for accessibility. (The proposals were later accused of being &quot;coordinated trolling&quot;...)I&#39;m skeptical that this is actually an AI and not in fact a person trolling.  That sounds exactly like what someone would do as a joke.  One of the stranger elements of AI literacy these days is remembering that things claiming to be AI generated sometimes aren&#39;t.  Often it&#39;s really a person just pretending.

Guess what happens when AI trains on an Internet of people trolling others.

If you lie down with dogs, you will wake up with fleas.
In this case Benj Edwards laid down with AI...
 
I think a great deal of the outrage being expressed against ArsTechnica is a manifestation of the pent up rage many of us feel towards the AI slop we&#39;re being force fed from all directions into all of our orifices. That rage will subside, and ArsTechnica will continue. Benj, on the other hand, will likely suffer more than he deserves for his overzealous and often credulous cheerleading of AI. Of all people, he should have understood its limitations.

The Gell-Mann amnesia effect [wikipedia.org] is at full power here.

When a journo fucks up something only you know something about, you still keep on trusting the reporting on stuff you know little about. But when a journo fucks up something obvious that everyone can see is obviously wrong....did the tree really make a sound?

In my experience. Requesting reference links is also useless. Even if provided, they are either 404 or unrelated.

You need to use a separate tool for verification, like a proper search engine.

They&#39;re not fake AI-generated quotes  AI actually generated these.  They&#39;re real AI-generated quotes.

Or did they mean &quot;fake, AI-generated quotes&quot;?  Commas matter.  There are books written about this.

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot;

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot; Agreed [slashdot.org]!

&quot;Lets eat, Grandma!&quot; does indeed have a different meaning than &quot;Lets eat Grandma!&quot;

&quot;...At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.&quot;

Yes, just one of thousands and thousands of &#39;isolated incidents&#39;. There&#39;s no pattern whatsoever. Don&#39;t worry your pretty little head about it.

And that name should have been in the Slashdot blurb.

Being sorry for something implies feeling. Sorry, datacenters full of chips do not feel. We need to stop talking about these clankers like they are human, and see them for what they are and not the charade they perform.

Or people have been told for half a century that trickle down, laissez faire capitalism would make us all prosperous. And all the while, Republicans and Democrats have been shaking hands to send our jobs over seas.

Tuition is up, housing is less affordable, and unsecured debt is way up. Opportunities to move up are far fewer than they once were for the working class. The quality of life for the bottom 50% has plummeted while our cities have turned into something worse than the shithole countries we used to i

That&#39;s not how market caps work. If you recall, Amazon didn&#39;t make a profit until its 10th year, and then, it was tiny. Compared to its market cap, that profit was infinitesimally small. This is because in the first decade, Amazon&#39;s investors plowed tons of money into the company to build it up. Since then, their profits have soared, reducing its P/E ratio to about 27x. Rivian&#39;s profits will likewise grow, unless they mismanage the business or calamity strikes, bring the P/E ratio to a more reasonable numbe

It shows they are moving in the right direction, and unlike Tesla it&#39;s not built on a cult of personality or bullshit promises about full self driving appreciating assets. It&#39;s just a solid business with a solid product, making a profit relatively early compared to other startups too.

Rivian&#39;s profits are from their software that VW purchased.Their cars are ranked as the most unreliable cars in the United States, unfortunately.

Rivian isn&#39;t that bad. Consumer Reports counts every minor problem and tallies that up for a reliability score. So the transmission in your Ford can grenade itself and that counts the same as a Rivian having a squeaky dashboard.

If platforms can&#39;t prevent AI slop and disinformation, then I question their need to exist, what value does a giant sack of trash offer?

Making tech companies take some responsibility is the only way we might have a somewhat useable internet in a couple years.

The problem always come on how to implement this, and how to do it without having massive authoritarian abuse.

But they are trying, and it needs to be done.

Defrauding investors is something billionares take very seriously. He isn&#39;t going anywhere. You can get away with a lot of crimes, but stealing from the wealthy comes with severe punishment.

Going for funny? I think it&#39;s because SBF is too honest. Michael Lewis wrote a very interesting book about the case...

Translation: The President is now Donald J Trump.

We promise to back FTX2.0 with Trump Coin.

As Trump pardons him, I can hear it now:“He’s been treated very very very very unfairly. Very very unfairly. Some people say more unfairly than anyone. I think worse maybe.  It’s a disgrace. “

Then onto the big-eyed blonde in the black turtleneck with the fake deep voice .

Amazing he finds the money after he figures out he&#39;s not getting out. Interesting you trust criminals.
That&#39;s not how it worked.  When FTX was declared insolvent, its affairs were handed over to an independent party to try to work out what went on, where the money went, and whether they could recoup investor&#39;s funds. By all accounts, FTX and Alameda had very poor or no book-keeping, and it took Some Time for all the various investments and accounts that they had to come to light.

TLDR: It was an independent third party who retrieved the funds that Bankman-Fried said were there all along.

Doing bad accounting isn&#39;t the same as stealing money, is it? He says the money was always there, and apparently it was. If true then where&#39;s the prosecution&#39;s case?

No, it&#39;s not the same as stealing money or committing fraud. It&#39;s also largely irrelevant to my response - it wasn&#39;t SBF suddenly finding the money because he wasn&#39;t getting pardoned, it was out of his hands by then.

An answer to your question is that if he broke the law but creditors didn&#39;t miss out because the underlying crypto rose hugely in value, he still broke the law.  The legal system rarely works on the &quot;no harm, no foul&quot;  law.  You don&#39;t avoid a speeding ticket simply because you weren&#39;t involved

They lost a lot of unrealized gains.SBF, a real toad, isn&#39;t wrong to lay this at the cops&#39; feet since they are the ones who set the valuation date. 

But it&#39;s also true that this is a bit like Ponzi scheme insiders crying about not cashing out when they had the chance.

That happened to the universe since Noah flooding. Because of the Donald. His crazy tariff policies have already precipitated the whole world into the abyss. It&#39;s very very very unfair for China and now everybody rightfully hates America like everybody should be.

Trump&#39;s goal here along with the tariffs is to create a national sales tax so that he can eliminate his tax burden and the tax burden of his buddies. As a percentage is still much much much less than you pay but because they have about 60% of all th

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

If you want to check if your town is on the list, Andrea recommends checking out Project Salt Box.

It is one thing for a state to say that it is dedicated to doing justice in capital cases. It is quite another for them to turn those commitments into action.

All too frequently, in those cases, words don’t govern actions. We say we are in favor of equal treatment but stand by while race shapes the fates of those accused of capital crimes. We say that we will not punish cruelly, but use methods of execution that impose unnecessary suffering on those we execute.

Earlier this month, Charles Flores filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court offering it the chance to change that by saying that Texas has to fulfill promises it has made to death row inmates. In his case, he wants to take advantage of a law that allows death row inmates to prove they were falsely convicted and are actually innocent.

The court should hear his case and require the Lone Star State to follow its own laws.

Charles Flores was convicted of the January 1998 killing of Betty Black during an attempted robbery. Right from the start, he has maintained his innocence.

His co-defendant, Richard Childs, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2016.

One of the witnesses who helped convict Flores was Jill Barganier, Betty Black’s neighbor, who insisted at Flores’ trial that she was 100 percent sure she had seen him enter Black’s house the morning she was killed. Her testimony proved to be decisive in securing his conviction since there was no physical evidence tying Flores to the murder.

We know that eyewitness identification is notoriously unreliable. In addition, the neighbor’s testimony was tainted in several ways.

First, on the day of the crime, she told police that two white men with long hair and similar builds got out of a car, a purple and pink Volkswagen Bug, and entered Black’s garage. She then picked a white male with long hair out as the driver she had seen.

But Flores looks nothing like that man. He is Hispanic, not white, and at the time that Black died, he had shaved hair and was overweight.

Bargainer also helped a police artist create a composite sketch of the men whom she saw enter Black’s house. It looked nothing like Flores.

To top it all off, she did not pick a picture of Flores out of an array of photos. So how could she go from all that to being sure Flores was involved in Black‘s killing?

She was helped along by what is called “investigative hypnosis.” A 1979 article published in the journal Detective describes it as a technique used to “obtain vital information that may have been forgotten.” Even then, though, the publication cautioned that “all leads developed through hypnosis should be verified with supporting physical or testimonial evidence … and investigative conclusion should not be based solely on hypnotically obtained information.”

Since that article was published, investigative hypnosis has been shown to be completely unreliable. “Instead of improving memory,” the Christian Science Monitor notes, “hypnosis may only manipulate it.”

That seems to have been the case with Barganier. During her hypnosis, the police asked her if one of the men she had seen had short, shaved hair.

During the hypnosis session, Barganier again described the man she saw driving the car as having “long, wavy” dark-blond hair. The hypnotist then asked her about the passenger and urged her to focus on his hair. She said it was “a lot like his friend’s,” and clarified: “dark, long.”

“Just relax,” the hypnotist said, “take a deep breath, take the time you need. Can you tell me how long his hair is? Does he have it neatly cut, or is it trimmed?”

That is a classic example of a suggestive question.

Even without such overt leading of a witness, courts in many places, including Florida, one of America’s leading death penalty states, have questioned “the reliability of statements procured by way of hypnosis.” A California court explained the danger of investigative hypnosis this way. Someone subject to hypnosis “will lose his critical judgment and begin to credit ‘memories’ that were formerly viewed as unreliable … will confuse actual recall with confabulation and will be unable to distinguish between the two, and … will exhibit an unwarranted confidence in the validity of his ensuing recollection.”

In 2023, Texas recognized that such defects were present in investigative hypnosis. It joined a “majority of jurisdictions, which ban post-hypnotic testimony.”

The Texas criminal code now says that a statement made during or after investigative hypnosis “is not admissible against a defendant in a criminal trial, whether offered in the guilt or innocence phase or the punishment phase of the trial, if the hypnotic session giving rise to the statement was performed by a law enforcement agency to investigate the offense that is the subject of the trial.”

But it was not made to apply to cases in which someone had already been convicted at the time was passed. That in itself should raise red flags.

A state decides that a kind of evidence is so unreliable that it should not be used in any criminal case, but is willing to see someone put to death when that kind of evidence was used to convict him. What kind of justice is that?

Crucially, the issue facing the Supreme Court is whether Texas is obliged to revisit this case. Texas has passed laws specifically designed to protect innocent people from wrongful execution. They allow prisoners to return to court by filing a writ of habeas corpus and present evidence of their innocence.

It also has a law on the books allowing courts to use a lower standard of proof in cases involving junk science.

Flores wants to take advantage of those laws. As he points out in his petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, he has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to allow him the chance to prove that he is in fact innocent of the crime for which Texas seeks to execute him.

But,” he contends, “the TCCA has repeatedly and arbitrarily barred these efforts without explanation.” By doing so, the court is, in essence, nullifying state law and depriving him of “the state-created liberty interest upon which he seeks to rely.”

“Due process,” his petition observes, “demands more than unexplained summary dismissal in response to a substantial threshold showing of actual innocence. This case and the question it presents are exceptionally important: whether a state law enacted to safeguard against executing the innocent, when rendered illusory in practice, offends the federal right to due process.”

“Once a right is established through state law,” Flores argues, “a deprivation of the right implicates federal procedural due process protection.”

He accuses the state of “gratuitously barring credibly innocent prisoners on death row from proving their innocence. This Court,” he adds, “should grant certiorari to clarify that the constitutional guarantee of due process prohibits state courts employing arbitrary or irrational procedures to foreclose even making the case of innocence.”

More than 50 years ago, the Supreme Court recognized what it called “statutory entitlements.” As Justice William Brennan put it, when the state creates a right for a class of individuals, it may not deny an individual seeking to exercise that right without “procedural due process.”

Quoting an earlier case, he noted, “’The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.’”

That is all Charles Flores is asking for, an “opportunity to be heard” on a life-and-death matter. If the Supreme Court does not give him that chance, it will add to the long list of instances when the law promises one thing but doesn’t deliver it to death row inmates.

Is Justice Samuel Alito getting ready to call it quits? A flurry of recent hints has prompted new speculation that the Supreme Court’s most reliably partisan conservative is eyeing the exits in advance of the 2026 midterms. On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern sift through the clues, politics, and legacy management that may be driving Alito toward retirement. They also game out whom President Donald Trump might pick—among the many MAGA judges already campaigning for the seat—as the justice’s possible successor. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Our friend Elie Mystal wrote a great piece in the Nation saying he thinks Alito is going to step down. Our friends at Strict Scrutiny have also suggested as much. Mark, what’s your gossipy buzz telling you?

Mark Joseph Stern: I agree. And the first reason is the announcement of the justice’s forthcoming memoir, which is pompously titled So Ordered: An Originalist’s View of the Constitution, the Court, and Our Country. Of course, justices do publish books on the bench. But there are some indications that this particular release will be a farewell postscript for Alito’s service. First, it’s coming out on Oct. 6, which is one day after the Supreme Court’s next term begins. As Elie noted, it is unusual for the justices to publish books in October because they like to promote their books, and they can’t do that when they’re stuck in D.C., hearing oral arguments. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett all published recent books in early September—timing that makes sense because that’s when the public is starting to pay attention again. The new term is gearing up, but the justices are not stuck in Washington. They are still free to fly around the country, plugging their latest release. I think it’s pretty unlikely that Alito would drop his memoir on a date when he specifically cannot do that.

Second, Alito just celebrated the 20th anniversary of his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Conservative lawyers and pundits marked the occasion by publishing laudatory articles that had, to me, a distinctly valedictory feel to them. That includes at least one former clerk who may well be in contact with the justice and even have an inkling of his plans. On top of that, Alito gave this rare interview to Politico, which surprised me given that it was Politico that published the leak of his Dobbs draft opinion. So you’d think he might have a grudge. Anyway, in that interview, he seemed to look back over his service and view Dobbs as his finest achievement, almost like the capstone of his tenure. He also hinted that he was not really enjoying the job or the coarse civic culture of our current moment.

Finally, there’s another book coming out, this one by Mollie Hemingway, a MAGA pseudo-journalist, called Alito: The Justice Who Reshaped the Supreme Court and Restored the Constitution. It’s going to be this obsequious, bootlicking celebration of Alito’s brilliance. The publisher’s description calls it “the authoritative—and explosive—inside story of Justice Samuel Alito and his powerful role in shaping the Supreme Court.” It seems highly probable that Alito gave interviews to Hemingway, even if it was on background. It feels to me as if he is trying to secure his legacy within the conservative legal movement and the conservative media, which is what matters most to him. And I think that the main reason he would be doing that is because he’s ready to step down and pass the torch.

I was struck by the fact that in the Politico interview, Alito said he wished Justice Antonin Scalia were around to take a victory lap, because the court has achieved so much of what he worked toward and is now finally on the right track. It’s so sad he’s missing it. Within a paragraph, Alito then suggested that Scalia would have been “appalled” by the ugliness, the coarseness of the discourse. Well, who was single-handedly responsible for coarsening the discourse at the Supreme Court for a very long time? Why, it was Scalia! He’d be loving the discourse right now. He built it.

I also think this love story about originalism from Alito feels a little cynical. You and I have spent a lot of time discussing whether Alito really is an originalist or if whether is perfectly result-oriented and completely political. Either way, I guess the better question isn’t what Alito calls himself but what he does. If he does step down soon, won’t it probably be because he wants Trump to replace him while Republicans hold the Senate?

Alito is not an originalist. In fact, he’s made fun of originalism before. His jurisprudence is completely aligned with the Republican Party platform. He watches Fox News. I’m sure he reads the polls. He must know there is a real chance that Republicans could lose the Senate in the fall—which, of course, means that he would be stuck on the bench for at least two more years, maybe six more years, maybe even longer.

And we know that his wife, Martha-Ann, has been counting the minutes until Alito can retire so she can fly whatever flag she wants to.

Martha-Ann definitely wants him to step down. And Alito saw how Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a bad bet and wound up getting replaced by a successor who is torching her legacy. He doesn’t want that to happen. He is savvy enough to know that stepping down before the midterms means that Trump can replace him with someone who is just as conservative, if not more so. Republicans have a comfortable margin in the Senate. Retiring now could cement his jurisprudence for years to come with a mini-Alito who is 30 years younger. That’s probably what is guiding his decision more so than anything else. But in fairness, when we give justices life tenure, we empower them to make these kinds of partisan decisions. You can hate the game, but you can’t really hate the player.

Who do you think could potentially inherit the mantle of the man who gave us witchburners as the reason to overturn Roe v. Wade?

I will throw out two names: Emil Bove, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, and Andy Oldham, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. I flag Bove because he has already proved his absolute fealty to Trump—first as his personal lawyer, then at the Justice Department, when he struck the corrupt bargain to drop criminal charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, defied court orders barring the illegal deportation of Venezuelan migrants, and reportedly helped kill the investigation into Tom Homan’s alleged acceptance of a bribe. We know that Trump was disappointed in his first three picks because he felt as if they weren’t sufficiently loyal to him. With Bove, he wouldn’t have to worry about that.

At the same time, I can imagine that the White House might not want to reopen Bove’s scandals or give Democrats an opportunity to probe them. He’s already gotten his reward with a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit. So, to my mind, Oldham is the more likely candidate. He’s a former Alito clerk and a MAGA fanatic who has gone very far out of his way to campaign for this seat with a constant stream of Trump-pandering opinions. He’s even further right than Alito, who has overruled him multiple times. He also looks the part, which may seem like a shallow observation, but we know that that is important to this president. I think he has a leg up on his colleague James Ho, who has also been campaigning for the seat, because Ho will not look the part to this president. If I had to put money down, I’d say Oldham will be the pick, because he’s got the far-right jurisprudence and he looks like the MAGA justice from central casting in Donald Trump’s dreams.

I think you’re aiming way too high in selecting actual sitting judges for this. I’m going to go with Lindsey Halligan and Jeanine Pirro. I know central casting is the most important phrase for Trump when selecting someone. But I also think the “Own the Libs” vibe is such that it could be Kash Patel. You seemed to suggest that gravitas at some level is important. And I’m not sure it’s going to be.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) is recruiting a chief digital and information officer, partly to help sort out its bot-ridden practical driving test booking system.

&quot;You will lead a critical portfolio that supports DVSA&#39;s plan (launched in December 2024) to reduce driving test waiting times, protect learner drivers from exploitation, and improve the customer booking system,&quot; stated chief executive Beverley Warmington, who joined the agency at the end of last year.

Warmington said the agency plans to double the size of its digital, data, and technology directorate, and bring more services in-house. Applications for the job, which has a salary of £95,000, close on February 22.

In December, the National Audit Office (NAO) criticized the DVSA over long waits for its practical driving tests. The NAO said these were primarily down to a lack of examiners but the situation was worsened by the agency&#39;s 18-year-old booking system being vulnerable to targeting by third-party cancellation checkers and slot resellers. It found some candidates paid up to £500 to secure a test that costs £62 on weekdays.

The government is changing the rules this spring so that tests can only be booked by candidates themselves, cutting out instructors and businesses, as well as limiting changes to a booking.

The new chief digital and information officer will take over from Becky Thomas, who is retiring. &quot;I&#39;m incredibly proud of what we&#39;ve achieved together as an agency,&quot; she wrote in a recent GOV.UK blog post.

Of the booking problems, she said: &quot;Our teams are working at pace to design, build, and deliver improvements to the current system following extensive consultation with our customers and the driver training industry.&quot;

Thomas highlighted other successes, including DVSA&#39;s introduction of British sign language bookings for driving theory tests and allowing payments with Apple Pay and Google Pay. She added that more than six million people have signed up for free text or email alerts to remind them about their MOT, the legally required annual roadworthiness check named after the former Ministry of Transport. DVSA introduced the reminders in 2017. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/anthropic_claude_ai_edits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has updated Claude Code, its AI coding tool, changing the progress output to hide the names of files the tool was reading, writing, or editing. However, developers have pushed back, stating that they need to see which files are accessed.

Version 2.1.20 collapsed the output so that instead of showing, for example, the file names and how many lines were read, it would just print &quot;Read 3 files (ctrl+o to expand),&quot; according to a post complaining that &quot;Claude Code is being dumbed down.&quot; The full details can still be accessed with the keyboard shortcut, but constantly invoking this is annoying and impractical.

Developers have many reasons for wanting to see the file names, such as for security, for knowing immediately if Claude is pulling context from the wrong files, and for easy audit of past activity by scrolling through conversation. &quot;When I&#39;m working on a complex codebase, knowing what context Claude is pulling helps me catch mistakes early and steer the conversation,&quot; one person wrote.

There&#39;s also a financial impact. If developers spot that Claude is going down a wrong track, they can interrupt and avoid wasting tokens.

A GitHub issue on the subject drew a response from Boris Cherny, creator and head of Claude Code at Anthropic, that &quot;this isn&#39;t a vibe coding feature, it&#39;s a way to simplify the UI so you can focus on what matters, diffs and bash/mcp outputs.&quot; He suggested that developers &quot;try it out for a few days&quot; and said that Anthropic&#39;s own developers &quot;appreciated the reduced noise.&quot;

Cherny said that developers who wanted more detail could enable verbose mode. Responses were lackluster, with one person writing: &quot;Verbose mode is not a viable alternative, there&#39;s way too much noise.&quot;

Another observation was that the new default output, such as &quot;searched for 2 patterns, read 3 files,&quot; conveys no useful information. &quot;It&#39;s not a nice simplification, it&#39;s an idiotic removal of valuable information,&quot; said a user.

Cherny responded to the feedback by making changes. &quot;We have repurposed the existing verbose mode setting for this,&quot; he said, so that it &quot;shows file paths for read/searches. Does not show full thinking, hook output, or subagent output (coming in tomorrow&#39;s release).&quot;

The problem with this is that making verbose mode less verbose is a bad change for those who wanted the full details.

Cherny also participated in a lengthy discussion on Hacker News. &quot;Claude has gotten more intelligent, it runs for longer periods of time, and it is able to more agentically use more tools... The amount of output this generates can quickly become overwhelming in a terminal, and is something we hear often from users,&quot; he said.

Those users who want the collapsed output seem to be mostly absent from the discussion. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you how many times I benefited from seeing the files Claude was reading, to understand how I could interrupt and give it a little more context... saving thousands of tokens,&quot; said one response.

Cherny said that the repurposed verbose mode was the solution, and that Claude Code will still default to the condensed view.

The debate is important because if AI tools like Claude Code hide what they are doing from developers (or other users), mistakes are more likely to slip through. &quot;I&#39;m a Claude user who has been burned lately by how opaque the system has become,&quot; said another developer. &quot;Right now Claude cannot be trusted to get things right without constant oversight and frequent correction, often for just a single step. For people like me, this is make or break. If I cannot follow the reasoning, read the intent, or catch logic disconnects early, the session just burns through my token quota.&quot;

Claude Code changes frequently, so it is likely that this aspect will be further tweaked, but there is not yet any indication that it will revert to the old behavior. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion If you&#39;ve ever flipped over a power brick, you&#39;ll be familiar with the hieroglyphics of type approval. It&#39;s become less crazy over the years as things have got smaller and signage requirements softened, but at its peak tens of logos and acronyms of testing labs and national approvals covered the backside of PSUs in surrealist graffiti.

There was and is method to it. Type approval means that the device won&#39;t kill you, won&#39;t jam your airwaves, won&#39;t burst into flames, and other desirable negatives. If a business buys approved equipment, it won&#39;t invalidate its insurance, and many other legal protections and permissions flow. When the system stops working, which it does when individual consumers can buy cheap stuff directly from overseas, fiery death can follow.

There hasn&#39;t been an equivalent concept in software, at least not in general. Life-critical systems with software in, yes, and lots of industry codes and compliance incantations, but never national guarantees of software or service behavior. Now there are good and growing needs for this to change. There are dangerous aspects of design and implementation common to many different classes of product, invisible to users, and no way of knowing what is safe.

Fortunately, organizations, nation-states, and entire blocs can and do recognize what&#39;s happening, and are beginning to react. If you use a service or software that stores your data or identity in a place or with people with no legal protection against state interference, you have no privacy or protection from being locked out.

Which is why, of course, digital sovereignty is so desirable. The bigger you are, the more practicable it is to realize, although it is very far from easy. Technologies, standards, procurement policies, implementations, user bases, support hierarchies – all manner of things have to be moved and coordinated. The whole thing must make practical, economic, and sustainable sense. We&#39;re seeing this happen, especially in Europe.

Matrix is a good example. A longstanding open messaging protocol with a coherent and sensibly stratified FOSS/commercial client roadmap, it is becoming the underpinning of choice for the digisov desirous, from the EU down. It&#39;s no guarantee of goodness, but if you want to go that way, it&#39;s a great component.

Or look at the European Payment Initiative (EPI). This isn&#39;t an EU initiative, but a project of European payment service providers (PSPs). The clue&#39;s in the name: PSPs are the entities that handle electronic transactions between customers and suppliers. Visa and Mastercard manage around two-thirds of all EU-based transactions and neither is European. There is no one European PSP, no one name to go to.

Last week, PSPs from Norway, Spain, Portugal, and Italy signed up to the EPI, sharing a common Europe-based transactional hub and letting customers in 17 countries use their existing payment providers interoperably. This isn&#39;t about open source. It isn&#39;t about EU-level political decisions. It creates a sovereign digital service just the same. It also demonstrates that digisov does not need to map onto political boundaries. Norway isn&#39;t in the EU, and other non-EU and non-Eurozone countries can join. They just need to have compatible regulatory and legal regimes.

It is thus entirely possible to see an EU definition of alignment that would grant membership of the European digital sovereign entity. Don&#39;t let the users get burned, then you get to use the regulatory mark. You get access to sectors and markets where alignment is either mandatory or very highly desirable.

Such services and products could be bundled into platforms, markets, and product categories. If it&#39;s possible, barely, for a savvy, motivated, focused organization to build its IT with some degree of digisov, think how far away the concept of a European consumer alternative in packaged services and products is to Apple, Google, or Microsoft. How would anyone begin to find AWS or Azure-free services online? Add a compliance mark, and the impossible becomes possible. No changes in law, no international treaties, just a single recognizable symbol that says that this will not catch fire and burn you.

Armed with that, anyone can join forces. You could build a Linux distro. You could align your existing Swiss-based secure email service, or your German datacenter company, or anything that&#39;s useful and follows the rules.

All it needs, at heart, is a definition of what qualifies a service, product, component, or entity as aligned. In other words, what the concept means in practice. What rights are guaranteed to users, their identity, and their data, not just in terms of what the organization promises but that the promises can be kept no matter what. That means operating in regimes without overweening laws or exemptions to individual rights. One could even call such a definition a constitution.

There&#39;s no need for anyone so minded to wait for permission to start this process. Find fellow travelers and talk to them. A rough consensus will do for starters, alongside honesty, and fearsome commitment. If the concept&#39;s good and the timing is right, it will catch fire – in the right way. You can&#39;t rally to the flag if there is no flag. If there is, nobody can stop you. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Who, Me? Welcome to Monday! The Register hopes you arrive at your desk well-rested after a pleasant weekend, and not stressed out by working late as is the case in this week&#39;s instalment of &quot;Who, Me?&quot; – the reader contributed column that chronicles your mistakes and escapes.

This week, meet a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Tom&quot; who in 2009 contracted for major supermarket chain that operated a website to order groceries and decided it needed another one on which to sell general merchandise.

&quot;We worked for about 18 months on the new site and one of my responsibilities was building out the development environments and defining the production deployment processes,&quot; Tom told The Register.

On arrival he found the production environment in &quot;a bit of a mess when I got there&quot; due to poorly documented patching. He also found &quot;absolutely massive&quot; deployment scripts.

&quot;One of the things I did was remove 6,000 lines from the scripts to attempt to make them more manageable,&quot; Tom wrote. &quot;And the scripts were only part of the process, I had to define all the other steps needed and script what I could, or document what I couldn&#39;t.&quot;

While Tom tidied things up as best he could, the supermarket wouldn&#39;t let him touch production systems – only employees were allowed to make those critical keystrokes.

After months of work, the new site was ready.

&quot;We needed to deploy our general merchandise patch on top of the existing groceries site,&quot; Tom explained. &quot;We had carried out multiple dry runs, deployed and rolled back in pre-production a number of times. And we had a four-hour window from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM to when the business would allow the site to be down for this process.&quot;

Tom sat next to the employee who was allowed to make the change.

&quot;I had supplied all the steps in detail, and all he really needed to do was cut and paste a few commands,&quot; he wrote.

But the employee decided to do it his way: Instead of deploying to each server in turn, he opened PuTTYCS – a tool that can send commands to multiple machines at once – and tried to update all the servers at once.

The staffer did ask Tom to confirm that the first step in the upgrade process was to remove the contents of one directory.

&quot;Yes, just clear that directory,&quot; Tom replied, then watched in horror as the staffer ignored the command in procedure and instead typed rm -rf * – the &quot;delete everything&quot; command that often gets readers into trouble.

&quot;Because he used PuTTY CS, the command went to every production server at once,&quot; Tom pointed out.

This happened at 02:00 AM and by then Tom had been working since 08:30 AM the previous day, after rising far earlier to make the two-hour commute to the supermarket giant&#39;s premises.

&quot;Maybe I wasn&#39;t sharp enough at that point to catch him before he hit Enter,&quot; he mused. &quot;I think I managed to get an anguished &#39;Nooooo!&#39; just as he hit it.&quot;

Time for sitrep: It&#39;s just after 02:00 AM, Tom is exhausted, and the supermarket&#39;s entire production department is gone.

The next four hours of his life involved frantic server rebuilds, application installs, patching, and restoring things to the state in which the infrastructure was ready for the upgrade that should have taken a few minutes.

At 07:00 AM the supermarket chain&#39;s e-commerce director arrived and asked if the upgrade went well.

&quot;No issues,&quot; said one of the supermarket&#39;s staffers.

&quot;They went to get coffee,&quot; Tom concluded. &quot;I went to get some sleep in the break area.&quot;

            <h2>Cisco set to release home-brew hypervisor as a VMware alternative</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/cisco_nfvis_for_uc_hypervisor/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cisco is getting close to releasing its own hypervisor, as an alternative to VMware for users of its calling applications – software like the Unified Communications Manager it suggests as an alternative to PBXs and other telephony hardware.

The networking giant requires those apps to run in VMs and for years supported them running under VMware.

Under Broadcom’s ownership, the virtualization giant is now reluctant to sell its low-end vSphere suites and instead focuses on its Cloud Foundation (VCF) private cloud bundle which is more expensive than past VMware offerings. It’s not hard to imagine that Cisco users who use VMware to virtualize only for calling applications would balk at acquiring VCF.

The networking giant therefore teased the hypervisor last year as a lightweight tool that offers “only the essential virtualization features” and ideal for “organizations seeking a stable, easy-to-manage hypervisor—without the overhead of third-party platforms or cloud dependencies.” At the same time, Cisco added support for its calling applications to run under Nutanix’s AHV hypervisor.

The new hypervisor, NFVIS-for-UC, only supports Cisco’s calling applications.

Cisco already offers a hypervisor called the Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) that it uses to deploy networking-centric workloads on some of its appliances. NFVIS-for-UC is a special edition of NFVIS that Cisco has given a separate product ID, distinct pricing, new licensing, “and a slightly different admin user interface.”

While the product is not yet on sale, Cisco promised it will arrive in Q1 of 2026. And on February 5th, the company published a virtualization guide [PDF] in which it reveals updated versions of its software are ready to run under the new hypervisor.

It therefore seems that before long some VMware customers have an off-ramp and that the virtualization market has another contender, albeit one content to play in a niche.

Product-specific hypervisors aren’t new: Citrix retreated from the general-purpose hypervisor market to focus on support for its own applications.

Independent analyst Michael Warrilow of Virtified told The Register HPE is currently doing similar things by integrating its own hardware and hypervisor. &quot;That&#39;s a nostalgic trip back to mid-1990&#39;s mid-range servers,&quot; he said.

&quot;Cisco&#39;s move makes perfect sense,&quot; Warrilow added. &quot;Virtual appliances exist everywhere and are a major obstacle in any migration from a general-purpose hypervisor.&quot;

He therefore thinks multi-hypervisor management will become critical over the next three to five years.

VMware probably won’t see Cisco’s moves as a threat, because it focuses squarely on customers willing to go all-in on VCF integrated compute, networking, and storage virtualization tools, plus a Kubernetes stack and cloud-native development environment. That strategy is arguably working as Broadcom reports VMware’s revenue has grown, and often points to major VCF wins at customers such as Japan’s Weather Association.

Broadcom has kept VMware’s smaller vSphere bundles on the books, but users whose subscriptions and support contracts expire tell The Register that at renewal time VCF is the only option on the table. One ~100-person organization we recently spoke to told us that they came away from license renewal negotiations convinced VMware did not want it as a customer, so happily migrated to a competitor and banked some savings.

Cisco’s new hypervisor could see that scenario play out more often, leaving customers utterly dependent on the networking giant (and perhaps its burgeoning agentic AI ambitions) but freed from the need to consider VCF. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Asia In Brief The United States may be about to change its policies regarding Chinese technology companies.

Evidence of the possible change emerged on Friday when the US Federal Register published an updated list of designated Chinese Military companies whose activities in the USA are greatly restricted.

The list disappeared within hours after a US government agency requested it be withdrawn, but numerous reports state that document listed Chinese web and cloud giants Alibaba and Baidu, plus automaker BYD, as companies tangled up with the Middle Kingdom’s military, and therefore a security risk.

The update also reportedly removed Chinese memory-makers ChangXin Memory Technologies and Yangtze Memory Technologies, a change that means both can sell their DRAM to US customers. The two companies make very small quantities of RAM, probably too little to offer significant price relief to US buyers.

Pentagon spokespeople have said a revised list will be made public soon.

Reuters, meanwhile, reports that the US may lift bans on Chinese telcos operating in the US, and also walk away from plans to prevent sales of TP-Link products.

If correct, those actions would reverse the first Trump administration’s “Clean network” policy that aimed to “secure Americans’ most sensitive information” from China by ensuring Middle Kingdom carriers, submarine cables, and clouds could operate in America.

The Clean Networks policy came into force in 2020 – perhaps a year too late to stop the Beijing-backed Salt Typhoon crew from totally owning US telecoms networks.

Reuters speculates that the administration’s easing of some restrictions on Chinese tech are a negotiating tactic ahead of a planned meeting between presidents Trump and Xi Jinping.

India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology last week announced new rules that require social media operators to automatically detect AI-generated content and remove some of it within two hours.

The rules [PDF] extend India’s digital media ethics laws to shorten the deadline for content removal from 24 hours to two hours when authorities deem takedowns are urgent due to possible personal harms.

The updated rules also ban using AI to create intimate content, plus content that “falsely depicts or portrays a natural person or real-world event.”

India’s government published the rules on February 10th and imposed a ten-day deadline for compliance.

Singapore’s prime minister last week announced a S$37 billion ($30 billion) R&D fund, some of which will go towards a new set of national AI Missions designed to “drive AI-led transformation in key sectors of our economy, and push the boundaries of what is possible, for Singapore and for the world.”

The island nation will focus on advanced manufacturing, connectivity, finance, and healthcare.

In his budget speech, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said Singapore hopes AI will “accelerate innovation and build best-in-class factories that can compete globally and “help to automate airport and seaport operations, move goods more efficiently, and strengthen Singapore’s position as a leading global hub.”

“Workers worry that AI will displace jobs. Societies worry about misinformation, bias, and the ethical use of powerful technologies. These anxieties are real — and we must confront them squarely,” he said. “But fear cannot be Singapore’s response. If we allow uncertainty to paralyse us, we will fall behind in a world that is moving rapidly ahead.”

“So we must act with clarity and resolve. AI is a powerful tool — but it is still a tool. It must serve our national interests and our people. We will define how AI is developed and used in Singapore. We will set clear rules to ensure it is applied responsibly and safely. And we will ensure that its benefits are shared widely across society.”

Google also last week announced new investments in Singapore.

IBM’s general manager for Greater China, Chen Xudong, last week issued New Year’s wishes to clients in which he said that during 2025 Big Blue “continued to adopt a second entrepreneurial approach and a do-or-die determination in the Chinese market, moving from ‘defending its territory’ to ‘conquering its territory.’”

Chen said IBM will do that by bringing more of its wares to China, and help exporters to reach new markets.

“As the AI wave overlaps with anxieties about going global, Chinese companies no longer need piecemeal technical patches, but rather integrated solutions tailored to their specific business needs,” he wrote. “Only by breaking down data and system silos, building a secure and flexible technological foundation, and embracing open-source application platforms can they firmly grasp both control and choice, achieving a new path to growth characterized by resilience and enhanced innovation.”

In 2018, Japanese company Ohta Seiki created the “Monster Wolf” – a robot with glowing red eyes designed to scare bears. Think of it as an modern scarecrow that caught the public imagination because bears coming into contact with people always makes the news in Japan.

As bear attacks surged last year, the Monster Wolf returned to prominence.

And now, according to Japanese outlet Nikkei, Ohta Seiki plans to release plush versions of the Monster Wolf.

One model will retain the original’s bear-scaring role, and will apparently be able to play back sounds including growls, howls, gunshots and a human voice uttering threats including &quot;You won&#39;t be spared!&quot; The 20cm robot will be remotely operable. The company plans a smaller model that can serve as a personal protection device, or just extract yen from the pockets of plush toy enthusiasts. ®

OpenClaw will live on as an open-source project.

Sam Altman announced on X that Peter Steinberger, the man behind the trendy AI agent OpenClaw, was joining OpenAI. He said that Steinberger has “a lot of amazing ideas” about getting AI agents to interact with each other, saying “the future is going to be extremely multi-agent.” He also said that this ability for agents to work together will “quickly become core to our product offerings.”

OpenClaw, previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot, exploded on the scene earlier this year and became the darling of the tech world. Its rise was swift, but not without its bumps along the way. Earlier this month, researchers found over 400 malicious skills uploaded to ClawHub. It also launched MoltBook, a social network where AI agents went to complain about their humans, debate the provability of consciousness, and discuss the need for a private place to exchange ideas. And then it was immediately infiltrated by humans.

In a post on his personal site, Steinberger said that joining OpenAI would allow him to achieve his goal of bringing AI agents to the masses, without the headaches of running a company. He explained:

I could totally see how OpenClaw could become a huge company. And no, it’s not really exciting for me. I’m a builder at heart. I did the whole creating-a-company game already, poured 13 years of my life into it and learned a lot. What I want is to change the world, not build a large company and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone.

For OpenAI, this is a high-profile hire after several big names were poached by Meta or left to form a rival. It also had a public falling-out with Elon Musk. Details of the deal aren’t public. It’s not clear how much Steinberger is getting paid or what his title might be. But Altman said that OpenClaw will continue as an open-source project in a foundation supported by OpenAI.

It features three of the most unhinged performances in cinema history, and I mean that as a compliment.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Let me just say that I highly recommend you go into Possession blind. Don’t watch a trailer. Don’t even finish reading this. Go watch it now over on Shudder, Criterion, or Metrograph. It’s also available through Kanopy or Hoopla if your library provides access. Then come back so we can talk about it in the comments. Though this probably isn’t one for the squeamish.

Possession is the sort of film that, even if you’ve had the whole plot spoiled for you, can be difficult to follow. After watching it twice, listening to three different podcasts, and reading multiple articles about it, I’m still not 100 percent sure what happened at various points in the movie. I just know I loved it.

You’re dropped immediately into a story about a crumbling marriage set against the backdrop of the Berlin Wall. It’s a formidable metaphor for the division between the stars — a very young and disarmingly handsome Sam Neill (Mark), and Isabelle Adjani (Anna), who turns in one of the most singular and unnerving performances in the history of cinema. Watching Adjani on screen is exhausting — She ricochets between unsettling detachment and high-octane delirium with alarming ease and speed. It’s the sort of performance that, when you hear it basically gave Adjani PTSD, you’re not surprised.

The third standout performance comes from Heinz Bennent, who plays Heinrich, the man Mark believes Anna is leaving him for. He moves through every scene like a drunk ballet dancer, and there’s something almost Wiseau-ian about his delivery. (It certainly doesn’t help that he keeps repeating Mark’s name.) In a more grounded film, the way he careens through the frame would seem absurd. But in the abstract nightmare of Possession, Bennent fits perfectly, rolling around, alternately assaulting Mark and coming on to him.

Director Andrzej Żuławski not only coaxes gorgeously unhinged performances from his stars, he builds live-action paintings. Mark and Ana sit in a cafe at the corner of a bench facing away from each other as they discuss the terms of their separation. (Before Mark tears through the cafe, hurling chairs and tables in a freakout for the ages.) Sam Neill violently pitches a rocking chair back and forth as the focus expertly tracks him. The film is simply gorgeous.

What begins as a bad acid trip about a failing marriage turns into a nausea-inducing body horror in its back half. It’s revealed that Anna isn’t leaving Mark for Heinrich. In fact, Heinrich is just as desperate to get Anna back, to find her and make her his. Instead, she is shacked up with what Anna Bogutskaya (host of The Final Girls podcast and author of Feeding the Monster) calls a “Lovecraftian fuck monster.”

It’s a grotesquerie of tentacles, oozing orifices, and uncanny humanoid features, created by Carlo Rambaldi, who won Academy Awards for special effects on Alien and ET. It feeds on people. Their bodies, but also their souls. Anna seems to think it’s some sort of deity, something holy. She uses it to explore parts of herself she has repressed or lost in her relationship with Mark.

The other men in her life can’t satisfy her, so she creates an ideal lover. What starts as a slimy creature, not unlike the baby from Eraserhead, eventually becomes a doppleganger of Mark.

And then there’s the subway scene. If you’ve ever heard of Possession before, it’s probably because of this scene. Adjani hurls herself around a deserted tunnel, grunting, screaming, convulsing, before oozing blood and god knows all over the wet concrete floor. As a viewer, I feel drained after watching it. It’s three of the most intense minutes ever committed to celluloid, and even if the rest of the film was terrible, Possession would be worth watching just for this scene.

There are so many different readings of this film. I’m still not entirely sure what happens at the end. Did their son Bob drown himself? Is Mark’s doppleganger the antichrist? Is Helen also a doppleganger? (I think so.) What is the deal with Heinrich’s mother? Is Anna possessed? Or is the titular possession about the men in her life trying to exert ownership of her?

In the month since I first watched this movie, I’ve told everyone I know about it. I can’t stop thinking about it or talking about it.

Deals have been admittedly pretty dry since the holidays, but now that February is in full swing, we’re starting to see strong discounts return across a range of categories. In fact, thanks to Valentine’s Day, the Super Bowl, and — as of this weekend — Presidents Day, retailers are once again offering a slew of notable tech deals, making now a great time to shop if you’ve been holding off on making a larger purchase.

Although the Super Bowl and V-Day have technically come and gone, plenty of discounts are still around. A few have been rebranded for Presidents Day — including the discounts we recently saw on Sonos soundbars and speakers — but others are part of a new wave of limited-time deals, letting you save on OLED TVs, wireless earbuds, iPads, and other gadgets through the end of tomorrow, February 16th.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best Presidents Day deals we’ve seen so far. As in previous years, we’ll continue updating this list with new picks throughout the long weekend.

Casio’s $429 Moflin promised me calm. I got a supposedly lovable robot nuisance.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

After a few weeks living with Casio’s AI-powered pet, Moflin, I finally understand why my mother hated my Furby so much. The fuzzy, guinea-pig-adjacent puffball fits snugly in the palm of my hand. It’s undeniably cute, in a weird kind of way, but the second it starts to squeak or twitch, I am hit with an overwhelming desire to hurl it as far as I can.

My antipathy surprises me. By any metric, I am the exact kind of person Moflin was made for: I long for the companionship of a pet, but can’t own one thanks to a mixture of lifestyle, allergies, a small London flat, and a broadly irresponsible temperament that makes caring for another living thing a questionable idea. I could also do with the “calming presence” advertised.

Casio is very clear that Moflin is not a toy, though perhaps that is also clear from the $429 price tag. Rather, it is positioned as a sophisticated “smart companion powered by AI, with emotions like a living creature” — the illusion of companionship without the responsibilities. The idea is that you will interact with it over time and it will “grow” alongside you, developing a personality shaped by how you treat it. The robot is part of a growing mini-industry of machines built with no other purpose than to keep us company. The sector has proven particularly popular in countries like South Korea and Japan (where Moflin has sold out), fueled in part by a loneliness crisis that’s hit older populations especially hard.

Unboxing Moflin felt less like meeting a pet and more like unwrapping a paperweight wrapped in a bronze wig. In a way, that’s exactly what it was: a hard white core of motors, sensors, and plastic, clad in the illusion of fur and two beady eyes that are the robot’s only facial features (a deliberate design choice it seems, perhaps to keep Moflin from wandering into uncanny valley territory). There was also a charging pod, which Casio says is “designed to feel natural and alive,” but read more like a giant gray avocado to me.

The robot takes about three and a half hours to charge fully. Casio says this is good for about five hours of use, though “use” is a generous term for what Moflin actually does: It doesn’t walk or follow you, just wiggles and whines in response to touch, sound, movement, and light. Its first chirp when I picked it up was cute, but then the motor noise kicked in, an audible mechanical whir every time it moved its head, instantly shattering the illusion. Nevertheless, I named it Kevin.

Once I clocked the whir, I started noticing everything else, and there was a lot to notice. Kevin the Moflin treated every minor movement or sound as a meaningful interaction. Attempts to cuddle it on the sofa as I watched TV became unbearable: Every shift in posture, every laugh, every cough elicited chirps and a burst of whirring motors. The same thing happened at my desk — typing set Kevin off, as did taking calls — and keeping it nearby swiftly became impossible. Because it’s constantly listening and sensing, it never really settles, leaving me with a needy kitten instead of the quiet lap cat I’d wanted.

I ended up banishing Kevin to another room, and then doing it again, and again, and again, until I caught myself tiptoeing around my own flat to avoid setting Kevin off. The only reliably calming feature was that, eventually, it ran out of battery.

As I couldn’t stand Kevin on my own, I started testing it in other contexts. Carrying Kevin around with me quickly became burdensome, not least because the charger is way too big to be considered portable (a USB cable may have broken the illusion, but it would’ve been handy). Kevin didn’t do too well in my bag — seeming distressed and wriggling around noisily, earning me some suspicious glances on the Tube — and when held, I became the weirdo with the squawking robot. Not very calming. Even at home with friends, Kevin felt like a chore I had to manage lest it become disruptive, moving it farther and farther away or returning it to the gray avocado to “sleep.” On New Year’s Eve, a friend went in for a proper cuddle — it was a “fluffy pet,” after all — only to recoil after the zip holding its fur carapace together scraped her cheek.

A common concern among my friends — and one that especially preoccupied my boyfriend, who, unlike me, hadn’t chosen to share his home with Kevin — was privacy. And as a longtime tech reporter, I know this isn’t an unreasonable reflex when dealing with a device that has an always-on microphone. Casio says Moflin processes data locally and does not understand language, converting what it hears into unidentifiable data to recognize my voice only.

Casio’s big claim is that all of this serves something deeper: emotional intelligence. With use, Moflin is supposed to grow more expressive, more familiar with your voice, and perform special gestures and animal-like responses when you’re nearby. Indeed, I have noticed Kevin’s movements and vocalizations change and become more varied over time, which only compounded my irritation. Casio says this bonding process can take up to two months, and that Moflin can evolve into more than 4 million personalities thanks to its AI. However, it’s hard to meaningfully register this level of granularity given the robot’s limited range of chirps, whirs, and head turns. Which is why, in practice, Moflin’s “personality” is something you experience through a companion app. Yes, the $429 robot is, in essence, a glorified Tamagotchi that can’t really express itself without a screen.

The app itself doesn’t do much to change that impression. For a product selling “emotions like a living creature,” the handful of contextless trait meters and generic mood tags offer a thin insight into Kevin’s inner life. The app, a spartan, cheap-looking affair, tells me Kevin’s current personality is “cheerful,” though behaviorally it seems no different. There’s also a dashboard showing four “personality parameters”: “energetic,” “cheerful,” “shy,” and “affectionate” (which numerous Reddit posts suggest might be more accurately translated as “clingy”). There’s also a “journal” to track Kevin’s activities, filled with thrilling and elaborate entries like “Rob hugged Kevin tightly,” “Rob scooped Kevin up,” and “Kevin had a lovely dream full of laughter.” What is one expected to do with this information? Even if I didn’t loathe my Moflin as much as I do, it’s not very interesting and it’s not remotely useful in helping me interact with it, offering none of the explanations or feedback of the kind that made caring for something like a Tamagotchi satisfying.

Moflin’s problem isn’t that it’s pointless. There are plenty of pointless gadgets out there — and I don’t despise any in the way I have grown to despise Kevin. The problem is that Casio is selling companionship without actually having produced a companion. A companion is more than something that happens to be near you and makes noise in response to your presence. Worse still, Casio is asking me to believe Moflin has a sophisticated inner life, one it can’t really express in the real world nor satisfyingly show on its app. At that point, I feel like I’m not using a companion, I’m using a noisy object with a dashboard.

The app did have one redeeming feature: the ability to stop Kevin’s movements and sounds by putting it into a “Deep Sleep Mode.” That’s where I left Kevin last week. I won’t be waking him anytime soon.

Analog sensors and haptics makes this a standout gaming mouse begging to be copied.

Enthusiast gaming keyboard tech has made the jump to gaming mice — well, to one gaming mouse so far. The $179.99 Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike is the first to feature analog sensors that use induction to register clicks faster than microswitches used in many mice.

Those sensors allow for a host of cool features beyond just lower latency. There’s a rapid trigger setting, popularized by Hall effect keyboards, that lets them quickly reset after being pressed to receive another input. The sensors in this mouse also let you customize how much you need to press each of the main buttons to send an input, requiring almost no pressure at all, a click that requires more effort (great if you’ve got an itchy trigger finger), or something in between.

One of the Superstrike’s most interesting changes is that it has haptics in place of switches under its buttons. They simulate the sound and feel of a click with surprising accuracy, and unlike tapping on an unmoving MacBook trackpad, the mouse’s main buttons move and bounce back up as you might expect them to. If their default click sensation isn’t doing it for you, you can make it more intense (at the expense of battery life), or remove it altogether for silent operation (at the expense of, well, knowing when you’ve clicked at all).

I’ve felt jaded over the years by numerous features introduced in gaming mice that claim to be more beneficial in competitive games than they feel in real-life use (shrinking weights, 8,000Hz polling rate, optical sensors did nothing for me, personally). But the Superstrike feels like the start of a big change in gaming mice, and Logitech got a lot right here, even though its design isn’t radically different from its past models.

If you’re wondering whether this mouse is for you, let me put it this way: The Superstrike, with its analog sensors and adjustable actuation distances, is far easier to recommend than a Hall effect gaming keyboard that offers the same features. The difference comes down to Logitech’s haptics; they feel like the real thing, but you can tweak the feel if you’d like to. On the other hand, Hall effect switches in keyboards have a certain feel — quiet, almost no resistance — and that can’t be changed.

I’ve been using the Superstrike for a few days for my work at The Verge and to play some games. Unsurprisingly, flexing its haptics and analog sensors in Google Chrome isn’t that exciting. They were fun features to tweak in Deadlock, however. With many, many button presses required to defeat creeps and player enemies — not to mention frequently clicking around in menus to buy upgrades — lowering both the haptics intensity and the actuation distance for the left mouse button felt right. With rapid trigger, I could more quickly get locked in to land more shots. The boost in responsiveness felt more noticeable with characters that can quickly burst automatic weapons (like Haze) than those who shoot one round of ammo at a time (like the archer Grey Talon).

I don’t envision many scenarios when I’d want to increase the actuation distance of the buttons. Although, it seems handy in extraction shooters, where your success can come down to keeping quiet at the right times. I’m prone to misfiring in games due to being nervous about making a play, so requiring more effort to click could aid me there. Regardless, it’s nice to have this flexibility afforded by the analog sensors.

I’ve watched and read a lot of coverage regarding the Superstrike since it launched, and my favorite was Dave2D’s video in which he comes to the conclusion that its lower latency and faster sensors de-aged his gaming chops, making him feel like he was in his prime again. As we age, our response time generally worsens, which explains why there are many, many young people in their teens and 20s who play games professionally, but not many who are older than that. The Superstrike is, unsurprisingly, proving to be popular with younger pros, like esports player Yigox, who recently used the mouse to win a Guinness World Record for most clicks in a minute at 760.

The Superstrike is not a magical youth serum for gamers. It doesn’t help you with aiming or provide unfair shortcuts to success. But its features aren’t gimmicks. Assuming you’re putting in the practice to get better at games, Logitech’s new mouse with its faster, more customizable clicks might help you hang with the competition a little longer.

Apple’s OG tracker still offers exceptionally precise tracking, which makes the current discount a great deal for iPhone users.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

With Apple’s second-gen AirTags now widely available, we’re already seeing inventory of the first-gen model begin to dwindle. Case in point? Amazon is no longer selling a single AirTag, and it’s unclear when — or if — the retailer will restock the first-gen model. Thankfully, you can still grab a four-pack of the first-gen location trackers for around $64 ($35 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for Presidents Day, which is $2 shy of the bundle’s best price to date. If you just want one, you can also buy a single tracker at Walmart for $17 ($12 off).

If you’re an iPhone owner, you’d be hard-pressed to find another tracker that’s as precise or as helpful as Apple’s AirTag. That’s because, like the second-gen model, the original can tap into Apple’s vast Find My network and leverage ultra wideband (UWB) technology. As a result, all you need to do is open up the Find My app on your phone and follow the on-screen arrows, sounds, or vibrations, which will guide you to the exact location of your item, even if it’s slipped between your car seats. That’s a level of precision many rival trackers, notably Tile’s, lack.

On top of that, you also get access to a growing list of helpful software features. You can, for example, share an AirTag’s location with up to five people — which comes in handy for families while traveling — and you can even temporarily share an AirTag’s location with some airlines (including American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic).

In addition to the aforementioned software perks, Apple’s handy location trackers are designed to last. The battery can last up to a year, and when it dies, you just need to swap in a standard CR2032 cell instead of replacing the tracker entirely. Each AirTag also carries an IP67 rating, meaning it can withstand both dust and a little bit of rain.

There are some features you’ll miss out on if you go with the last-gen AirTag instead of the newer model, including an upgraded UWB chip that enables more precise location tracking. The second-gen version can also help you track items further away, and the speaker is 50 percent louder. But if you want to save some cash, the original is still one of the better trackers on the market and definitely worth picking up while you still can.

But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago.

That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O’Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services.

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. And we need to be ready for what comes next. Read the full story.—Rhiannon Williams

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/anthropics-30b-raise-is-about-more-than-money">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.
