            <h2>Verizon starts requiring 365 days of paid service before it will unlock phones</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-starts-requiring-365-days-of-paid-service-before-it-will-unlock-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Verizon has started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division, one week after the Federal Communications Commission waived a requirement that Verizon unlock handsets 60 days after they are activated on its network.

Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its spectrum licenses and merger conditions that helped Verizon obtain approval of its purchase of TracFone. But an update applied today to the TracFone unlocking policy said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically.

The “new” TracFone policy is basically a return to the yearlong locking it imposed before Verizon bought the company in 2021. TracFone first agreed to provide unlocking in a 2015 settlement with the Obama-era FCC, which alleged that TracFone failed to comply with a commitment to unlock phones for customers enrolled in the Lifeline subsidy program. TracFone later shortened the locking period from a year to 60 days as a condition of the Verizon merger.

While a locked phone is tied to the network of one carrier, an unlocked phone can be switched to another carrier if the device is compatible with the other carrier’s network. But the new TracFone unlocking policy is stringent, requiring customers to pay for a full year of service before they can get a phone unlocked.

“For all cellphones Activated on or after January 20, 2026, the cellphone will be unlocked upon request after 365 days of paid and active service,” the policy says. A customer who doesn’t maintain an active service plan for the whole 12 months will thus have their unlocking eligibility date delayed.

Besides TracFone, the change applies to prepaid brands Straight Talk, Net10 Wireless, Clearway, Total Wireless, Simple Mobile, SafeLink Wireless, and Walmart Family Mobile. Customers who bought phones before today are still eligible for unlocks after 60 days.

As DroidLife points out, the Verizon-owned prepaid brand Visible is also requiring a year of paid service. The Visible policy updated today requires “at least 365 days of paid service” for an unlocking request. “If you stop paying for service, your progress toward the 365-day requirement pauses. It will resume once you reactivate your account and continue until you reach a total of 365 paid days of service,” the policy says.

The unlocking policy for Verizon-branded phones has not been updated since May 2025. The policy calls for phones to be unlocked automatically after 60 days of paid service, but it will probably be changed soon because of the FCC waiver.

Once updated, the primary Verizon policy will presumably match the TracFone subsidiary’s 365-day locking period, or at least require something longer than 60 days. It’s also likely to require customers to request an unlock since the FCC no longer requires Verizon to unlock phones automatically. We contacted Verizon about its plans today and will update this article if it provides a response.

AT&T’s policy allows unlocking of phones on postpaid plans after 60 days if the device has been paid in full, or after six months for phones on prepaid plans. T-Mobile’s policy allows unlocking of phones on postpaid plans after 40 days if the device has been paid in full, or after 365 days for phones on prepaid plans.

Verizon and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr have justified longer locking periods as a method of deterring fraud. When approving Verizon’s waiver request, the Carr FCC said the Verizon rule “required one wireless carrier to unlock their handsets well earlier than standard industry practice, thus creating an incentive for bad actors to steal those handsets for purposes of carrying out fraud and other illegal acts.”

Consumer advocacy groups disputed the argument, telling the FCC that “Verizon offers no specific evidence that a longer lock period would have prevented the fraudulent acquisition of the devices it identifies,” and that Verizon is capable of detecting and responding to fraud within 60 days of a phone’s activation. Consumers and small carriers will be hurt by the decision, the groups told the FCC, saying that automatic unlocking “facilitates the resale and reuse of mobile devices, reduces e-waste, and enables low-cost carriers and MVNOs to compete on a more level playing field.”

While the Biden-era FCC’s leadership criticized yearlong locking periods and proposed a 60-day unlocking requirement for all carriers, the Trump FCC appears likely to write a new industry-wide standard that would be welcomed by large mobile carriers. The FCC rejected a request to limit Verizon’s locking period to 180 days, and said the Verizon waiver will stay in effect until the agency “decides on an appropriate industry-wide approach for the unlocking of handsets.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTubers have been increasingly frustrated with Google’s management of the platform, with disinformation welcomed back and an aggressive push for more AI (except where Google doesn’t like it). So it’s no surprise that creators have been up in arms over the suspicious removal of YouTube’s advanced SRV3 caption format. You don’t have to worry too much just yet—Google says this is only temporary, and it’s working on a fix for the underlying bug.

Google added support for this custom subtitle format around 2018, giving creators more customization options than with traditional captions. SRV3 (also known as YTT or YouTube Timed Text) allows for custom colors, transparency, animations, fonts, and precise positioning in videos. Uploaders using this format can color-code and position captions to help separate multiple speakers, create sing-along animations, or style them to match the video.

Over the last several days, creators who’ve become accustomed to this level of control have been dismayed to see that YouTube is no longer accepting videos with this Google-created format. Many worried Google had ditched the format entirely, which could be problematic for all those previously uploaded videos.

Google has now posted a brief statement and confirmed to Ars that it has not ended support for SRV3. However, all is not well. The company says it has temporarily limited the serving of SRV3 caption files because they may break playback for some users. That’s pretty vague, but it sounds like developers made a change to the platform without taking into account how it might interfere with SRV3 captions. Rather than allow those videos to be non-functional, it’s disabling most of the captions.

Google’s forum post says that while SRV3 is disabled, creators will not be able to upload new SRV3 captions. Videos that already have them may not show any captions until the feature is restored. However, Google notes most uploaders use other caption formats and are not affected by the playback bug.

Interestingly, Google also notes that the changes should be temporary for almost all videos. That implies some features of SRV3 may not be fully supported with whatever Google is doing on the back end. The company makes no promises about a timeline to re-enable SRV3—creators who have relied heavily on it may have to go back and re-create their captions in less capable formats or simply rely on AI-generated captions in the meantime.

Regardless of whether Google knew this would happen, it shouldn’t have left the community to stew about it for a week. This also suggests Google isn’t very serious about supporting its in-house CC format, which it has opted not to officially document. Creators should probably factor that into their future plans.</div>

            <h2>Flesh-eating flies are eating their way through Mexico, CDC warns</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/be-on-the-lookout-for-flesh-eating-flies-cdc-tells-clinicians-in-alert/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to clinicians Tuesday, warning that the savage, flesh-eating parasitic fly—the New World Screwworm—is not only approaching the Texas border, but also felling an increasing number of animals in the bordering Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

The advisory, released through the agency’s Health Alert Network, directs doctors, veterinarians, and other health workers to be on the lookout for patients with wounds teeming with ferocious maggots burrowing into their living flesh. The alert also provides guidance on what to do if any such festering wounds are encountered—namely, remove each and every maggot to prevent the patient from dying, and, under no circumstance allow any of the parasites to survive and escape.

The New World Screwworm (NWS) is a fly that lays its eggs—up to 400 at a time—in the wounds, orifices, and mucus membranes of any warm-blooded animal. The eggs hatch into flesh-eating maggots, which look and act much like screws, twisting and boring into their victims while eating them alive.

While the flies are indiscriminate killers, they’re particularly devastating to livestock and are estimated to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage each year. As such, the US Department of Agriculture has been leading the response to the threat, which had been held far at bay until recently. NWS used to be endemic in the US, causing heavy losses to cattle in the country. But, in the 1950s, US scientists developed a strategy to eliminate the flies by raising and releasing sterile male flies. The method exploits the fact that female flies mate only once in their 21-day lifespan. Thus, unproductive mating with a flood of sterile males can cause the population to crash.

With this strategy, screwworms were eradicated from the US around 1966 and, through coordinated efforts, cleared out from Central America in the subsequent decades. They were declared eradicated from Panama in 2006 and actively held at bay with continual sterile-fly releases along the Darién Gap, creating a biological barrier. But the barrier was breached in 2022 amid development and movement through and around the gap. Since then, the flies have quickly been marching north with the help of unregulated cattle movements.

Across Central America and Mexico, there have been 1,190 human cases of NWS reported and seven deaths. More than 148,000 animals have been affected.

In September, the USDA warned that an 8-month-old cow with an active NWS infection was found in a feedlot in the Mexican state of Nuevo León, just 70 miles from the border. The finding prompted Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller to step up warnings about the threat.

“The screwworm is dangerously close,” Miller said at the time. “It nearly wiped out our cattle industry before; we need to act forcefully now.”

According to the USDA’s latest data, Nuevo León has seen three cases in the outbreak, with none that are currently active. But, its neighboring state, Tamaulipas, is having a flare-up, with eight animal cases considered active. The Mexican state shares a border with the southern-most portion of Texas. Mexico overall has reported 24 hospitalizations among people and 601 animal cases.

For now, the NWS has not been detected in the US, and the CDC considers the risk to people to be low.

“However, given the potential for geographic spread, CDC is issuing this Health Advisory to increase awareness of the outbreak and to summarize CDC recommendations for clinicians and health departments in the United States on case identification and reporting, specimen collection, diagnosis, and treatment of NWS, as well as guidance for the public,” the agency said.

Generally, the agency advises being on the lookout for egg masses or fly larvae in wounds or infection sites, especially if there’s destruction of living tissue or feelings of movement. Once discovered, health care workers should report the case and promptly remove and kill all larvae and eggs, preferably by drowning in a sealed, leak-proof container of 70 percent ethanol. “Failure to kill and properly dispose of all larvae or eggs could result in the new introduction and spread of NWS in the local environment,” the CDC warns in bold. At least 10 dead larvae should then be sent to the CDC for confirmation.

The USDA is currently releasing 100 million sterile male flies per week in Mexico to try to establish a new biological barrier.

This isn’t the fly’s first attempt at a US comeback since the 1960s. In 2016, the flies were somehow reintroduced to the Florida Keys, where they viciously attacked Key Deer, an endangered species and the smallest of North America’s white-tailed deer. The flies were eliminated again in 2017 using the sterile fly method.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/macaque-facial-gestures-are-more-than-just-a-reflex-study-finds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Recent advances in brain-computer interfaces have made it possible to more accurately extract speech from neural signals in humans, but language is just one of the tools we use to communicate. “When my young nephew asks for ice cream before dinner and I say ‘no,’ the meaning is entirely dictated by whether the word is punctuated with a smirk or a stern frown,” says Geena Ianni, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania. That’s why in the future, she thinks, neural prostheses meant for patients with a stroke or paralysis will decode facial gestures from brain signals in the same way they decode speech.

To lay a foundation for these future facial gesture decoders, Ianni and her colleagues designed an experiment to find out how neural circuitry responsible for making faces really works. “Although in recent years neuroscience got a good handle on how the brain perceives facial expressions, we know relatively little about how they are generated,” Ianni says. And it turned out that a surprisingly large part of what neuroscientists assumed about facial gestures was wrong.

For a long time, neuroscientists thought facial gestures in primates stemmed from a neat division of labor in the brain. “Case reports of patients with brain lesions suggested some brain regions were responsible for certain types of emotional expressions while other regions were responsible for volitional movements like speech,” Ianni explains. We’ve developed a clearer picture of speech by tracing the origin of these movements down to the level of individual neurons. But we’ve not done the same for facial expressions. To fill this gap, Ianni and her team designed a study using macaques—social primates that share most of their complex facial musculature with humans.

The study started by putting the macaques in an fMRI scanner to monitor their brain activity while recording their faces with a high-resolution camera. The team then exposed their participants to various stimuli: videos with other macaques making faces at them, interactive avatars, or other live macaques. “This elicited socially meaningful facial expressions that are part of the subjects’ natural repertoire,” Ianni says.

Based on the video analysis, scientists identified three facial gestures they wanted to focus on: the lipsmack macaques use to signal receptivity or submission; the threat face they make when they want to challenge or chase off an adversary; and chewing, a non-social, volitional movement. Then, using the fMRI scans, the team located key brain areas involved in triggering these gestures. And when this was done, Ianni and her colleagues went deeper—quite literally.

“We targeted these brain areas with sub-millimeter precision for implantation of micro-electrode arrays,” Ianni explains. This, for the first time, allowed her team to simultaneously record the activity from many neurons spaced across the areas where the brain generates facial gestures. The electrodes went into the primary motor cortex, the ventral premotor cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the cingulate motor cortex. When they were in, the team once again exposed the macaques to the same set of social stimuli, looking for neural signatures of the three selected facial gestures. And that’s when things took a surprising turn.

The researchers expected to see a clear division of responsibilities, one where the cingulate cortex governs social signals, while the motor cortex is specialized in chewing. Instead, they found that every single region was involved in every type of gesture. Whether the macaques were threatening a rival or simply enjoying a snack, all four brain areas were firing in a coordinated symphony.

This led Ianni’s team to the question of how the brain distinguished between social gestures and chewing, since it apparently wasn’t about where the brain processed the information. The answer was in different neural codes—different ways that neurons represent and transmit information in the brain over time.

By analyzing neural population dynamics, the team identified a temporal hierarchy across the cortex in macaques. The cingulate cortex used a static neural code. “The static means the firing pattern of neurons is persistent across both multiple repetitions of the same facial gesture and across time,” Ianni explains, and maintained their firing pattern till 0.8 seconds after that. “A single decoder which learns this pattern could be used at any timepoint or during any trial to read out the facial expression,” Ianni says.

The firing rates in the motor and somatosensory cortex, on the other hand, looked radically different. This suggests there is a dynamic neural code defined by rapidly changing firing rate relationships amongst the neural populations.

The team thinks this means that the cingulate cortex manages the social purpose and context of the facial gesture, which is relatively stable. This may be where the brain integrates sensory cues—like the look of another monkey’s expression—with its own internal state to produce the right facial gesture for the occasion.

The dynamic code areas implement this expression by driving individual muscles. “They’re driving the kinematics like ‘move this lip a millimeter to the left, now a millimeter to the right,’” Ianni explains. These constant miniscule movements of muscles are necessary because facial expressions are usually dynamic—macaques’ eyelids, lips, cheeks, and ears are constantly twitching and changing their position even if the end effect looks still from a distance.

But that’s just the beginning of a long journey.

“There have been such fabulous, impressive advances in the field of assistive communication devices even since I started this project,” Ianni says, and points to neural prostheses developed by Maitreyee Wairagkar’s team Ars covered in 2025 as one of the examples. Building a similar neural prosthesis for decoding facial gestures is unlikely to happen overnight, though. We’re a rather long way away from truly restoring the ability to communicate through facial gestures to patients who lost it.

Ianni’s study is the first that recorded neurons producing facial gestures with multi-electrode arrays. This means we’ve only just begun to build up base science on the neural mechanism behind making faces. This is the point where neural speech decoding technology was in the late 1990s, and we still can’t make that reliable enough for regular clinical products.

Still, Ianni remains hopeful. “I hope our work goes towards enabling the field, even the tiniest bit, towards more naturalistic and rich communication designs that will improve lives of patients after brain injury,” she says.

            <h2>Netflix to pay all cash for Warner Bros. to fend off Paramount hostile takeover</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/netflix-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-fend-off-paramount-hostile-takeover/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Netflix agreed to pay all cash for Warner Bros. Discovery, amending its $72 billion deal in an attempt to fight off Paramount’s hostile takeover bid.

Netflix originally agreed to buy the company with a mix of cash and stock. To sweeten the offer for shareholders, Netflix and Warner Bros. today announced that Netflix will pay all cash instead. If successful, Netflix’s purchase will include HBO Max, WB Studios, and other assets.

The price is unchanged at $27.75 per share, and Warner Bros. is targeting an April 2026 shareholder vote. The original plan was for Netflix to buy each Warner Bros. share with $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock.

The revised agreement “simplifies the transaction structure,” “accelerates the path to a WBD stockholder vote,” and “provides enhanced certainty around the value WBD stockholders will receive at closing, eliminating market-based variability,” today’s press release said. Netflix plans to finance the deal with “a combination of cash on hand, available credit facilities and committed financing.”

Netflix’s pending purchase of Warner Bros. has an equity value of $72 billion and an enterprise value of $82.7 billion, which includes both equity and debt. Paramount Skydance has been trying to upend the deal with its own offer to buy Warner Bros. in a hostile takeover attempt that includes a lawsuit it filed against Warner Bros. last week.

Paramount offered $108.4 billion at $30 per share, but it’s trying to buy the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, while Netflix’s deal is for just the streaming and movie studios divisions. The Warner Bros. board wants to complete a separate spinoff of its cable TV division, which would not be possible if Paramount’s hostile takeover succeeds. The spinoff is scheduled to be completed before the closing of the sale to Netflix, and the spun-off entity would be called Discovery Global.

“By transitioning to all-cash consideration, we can now deliver the incredible value of our combination with Netflix at even greater levels of certainty, while providing our stockholders the opportunity to participate in management’s strategic plans to realize the value of Discovery Global’s iconic brands and global reach,” Warner Bros. Discovery board Chairman Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in today’s press release.

Paramount also made an all-cash offer, but the Warner Bros. board called the Paramount bid “illusory” because it requires an “extraordinary amount of debt financing” and other terms that allegedly make it less likely to be completed than a Netflix merger.

Paramount “is a $14B market cap company with a ‘junk’ credit rating, negative free cash flows, significant fixed financial obligations, and a high degree of dependency on its linear business,” while Netflix has “market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026,” Warner Bros. told shareholders.

Warner Bros. and Netflix today continued to tout Netflix’s strong financial position and its ability to close the deal. “Netflix’s strong cash flow generation supports the revised all-cash transaction structure while preserving a healthy balance sheet and flexibility to capitalize on future strategic priorities,” the joint press release said.

The Wall Street Journal explained that the new “deal structure does away with a so-called collar, a mechanism meant to protect shareholders from large swings in an acquirer’s share price between the time when a deal is announced and when it closes. If Netflix shares dipped below $97.91, Warner shareholders were to get a larger portion of Netflix shares as part of the deal. If they rose above $119.67, shareholders would have received a smaller portion.”

Netflix’s stock price closed at $100.24 on December 5 and is down to about $88, partly due to investor fears that Netflix will have to pay more to complete the merger.

The Paramount lawsuit against Warner Bros. alleges that the company board failed to disclose basic information that stockholders need to decide between the Paramount and Netflix bids. The lawsuit seeks details on how Warner Bros. valued the shares in its planned spinoff, and other information such as how Warner Bros. determined that the Paramount offer was too risky.

“WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer—and importantly, Delaware law has consistently required that such information be provided to shareholders,” Paramount CEO David Ellison wrote in a letter to Warner Bros. shareholders after filing suit in Delaware Chancery Court.

Paramount says its own analysis of Discovery Global assets values the spinoff company at $0 per share.

“WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer,” Ellison wrote. Warner Bros. reportedly responded that Paramount “has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer,” and “is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value.”

Paramount’s lawsuit hasn’t been an immediate success. A judge last week rejected Paramount’s request to expedite the case, saying it did not suffer “cognizable irreparable harm” from the allegedly inadequate disclosures.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TCL is taking majority ownership of Sony’s Bravia series of TVs, the two companies announced today.

The two firms said they have signed a memorandum of understanding and aim to sign binding agreements by the end of March. Pending “relevant regulatory approvals and other conditions,” the joint venture is expected to launch in April 2027.

Under a new joint venture, Huizhou, China-headquartered TCL will own 51 percent of Tokyo, Japan-headquartered Sony’s “home entertainment business,” and Sony will own 49 percent, per an announcement today, adding:

The joint venture will operate globally, handling the full process from product development and design to manufacturing, sales, logistics, and customer service for products including televisions and home audio equipment.

The joint venture will continue to release TVs and home audio gadgets under the “Sony Bravia” branding; however, the TVs will rely on TCL display technology. The joint announcement suggested focuses on bigger TVs, higher-resolution displays, and “smart features.”

The news comes as the TV industry has struggled with decreasing margins and has become more competitive. Meanwhile, devices have become cheaper, and people are buying new TVs less frequently. Competition between Chinese companies, like TCL and Hisense, and South Korean firms, like LG and Samsung, has heated up, with Chinese companies making increasingly competitive budget and mid-range-priced TVs, and the South Korean government reportedly pushing local TV firms to work together. Numerous Japanese companies, including Toshiba and Sharp, have already exited or reduced their TV businesses.

The upcoming joint venture also comes as Sony has focused less on electronics in recent years. For example, it stopped making its Vaio PCs in 2014 and quit Blu-rays last year. Meanwhile, it has been focusing on intellectual property, like anime and movies, as Bloomberg noted. The joint venture should allow Sony to focus on its more lucrative businesses and allow TCL to gain an advantage by leveraging Sony’s more high-end Bravia devices and brand.</div>

            <h2>Scientists Suddenly Discover That Cow Tools Are Real</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After more than forty years, a bizarre panel from “The Far Side” comic strip has finally become prophecy. The cartoon depicts a strangely eye-less, bipedal cow standing in front of a bench of oddly-shaped objects, with the caption “Cow tools,” and no further context.

The “joke” — that cows are too stupid to make practical tools? — landed so flat that the cartoonist Gary Larson issued a public statement explaining it after readers swamped newspapers with confused inquiries after it ran.

Larson probably couldn’t predict that “Cow tools” would become a cultish internet meme decades later, serving for those in the know as an endearing icon of anti-humor — with such a heavy emphasis on the “anti” part that it borders on avant-garde art.

Similarly, the storied cartoonist probably never anticipated that “Cow tools” would turn out to be a real phenomenon.

You heard that right. In a new study published in the journal Current Biology, scientists say they’ve documented the first ever verified case of a bovine using a tool, suggesting we’ve been seriously underestimating the intelligence of these gentle creatures.

In footage shared by the researchers, the cow named Veronika holds a lengthy broom handle in her mouth and manipulates it to scratch herself, displaying impressive dexterity as she reaches everywhere on her body from her stomach to her rear end.

The feat is clearly no fluke, and remarkably, Veronika had received no training.

“[Veronika] did not fashion tools like the cow in Gary Larson’s cartoon, but she selected, adjusted, and used one with notable dexterity and flexibility,” the researchers wrote in the study. “Perhaps the real absurdity lies not in imagining a tool-using cow, but in assuming such a thing could never exist.”

Cows itch, just like us. But Veronika the cow takes things into her own hands. Or rather: into her mouth.Scientists say it’s the first experimentally verified instance of cattle using a tool.  https://t.co/lnEEHQgVai pic.twitter.com/kxGEK4MWsH

The authors highlight how astonishingly little research has been done to explore the cognitive abilities of cows and other cattle. As author Alice Auersperg, a cognitive biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, put it, the “findings highlight how assumptions about livestock intelligence may reflect gaps in observation rather than genuine cognitive limits,” she said in a statement about the work.

Veronika is a Swiss Brown cow and was raised by a farmer in Austria, who starting ten years ago began to notice that the creature would sometimes pick up sticks on her own to scratch herself. After a video taken of Veronika’s shrewd habits caught the researcher’s attention, they immediately traveled to the farm to study her closely, performing controlled trials in which they carefully observed and recorded her habits.

The findings were stunning. They found that Veronika would consistently target specific body parts, and that she generally preferred using the brush end of the stick to scratch herself — except when she scratched more sensitive regions of her body, when she instead favored the smooth end. In further evidence of the cow’s deliberate control, she used wide, forceful movements to scratch her upper body, while soothing her lower-body with slower and more controlled ones. This demonstrates “genuinely flexible tool use,” lead author Antonio Osuna-Mascaró, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, said in the statement, as well as the ability to anticipate the “outcome of her actions and adjusting her grip and movements accordingly.”

Tool use was once considered the hallmark of human intelligence, but that notion has firmly been debunked, challenging a narrower understanding of what intelligence is. Some chimpanzees, for example, use sticks to extract termites from trees. Crows, too, are frequently observed using twigs to reach their grub.

That said, tool usage is rarely observed in the wild, and it’s even more rare to see it used in a “flexible,” multi-purpose manner.

“Because she is using the tool on her own body, this represents an egocentric form of tool use, which is generally considered less complex than tool use directed at external objects,” said Osuna-Mascaró. “At the same time, she faces clear physical constraints, as she must manipulate tools with her mouth.”

While Veronika’s skills are stunning, she probably isn’t an singularly intelligent cow — which is encouraging to scientists. “We know more about the tool use of exotic animals on remote islands than we do about the cows we live with,” Osuna-Mascaró told CNN in an interview. Now, at least, we’re “starting to be sensitive enough to observe them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, we broke down a major debacle unfolding in the health research space. To recap: over the past month, concerned researchers have been sounding the alarm about a reprehensible vaccine study which was to be funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the tune of $1.6 million.

According to the trial protocols, obtained by Inside Medicine writer and physician Jeremy Faust from an anonymous American employee at the US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), the research would have followed 14,000 infants in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. The problem? Only 7,000 of those newborns would have received an urgently needed hepatitis B vaccine, in order to compare the two groups. On top of the flagrant ethics violations, the total cost of the research would have exceeded the cost to pay for “over a decade’s worth of Hepatitis B vaccine birth doses [for everyone] in Guinea-Bissau.”

In their interview with Faust, the unnamed CDC employee called it “another Tuskegee,” a reference to the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which hundreds of Black men with syphilis were studied by government researchers — who never informed them of their disease or made them aware of the treatment that had been discovered for it.

“I have read every word of the protocol dated January 14, 2026,” Faust told Futurism in an email. “It is wretched.”

At the time of our writing, the Guardian had reported that officials with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention — the public health agency run by the African Union, not to be confused with the US CDC — stated that the trial had been halted, seemingly by Guinea-Bissau’s public health authorities.

This is where things get weird. In an email responding to our post about the situation, an official from the HHS press office declared that the vaccine trial was still on.

“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the spokesperson insisted. “Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts.”

The official also makes it clear that the HHS sees these infants more like lab rats than human beings.

“This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of [hepatitis B],” they continued.

Those comments are astonishing enough. But in followup remarks that they insisted were “on background” — despite the fact that we’d agreed to no such arrangement — they went on to disparage their colleagues at the Africa CDC in coarse terms that were striking even by the standards of the notoriously churlish Trump administration.

“This is a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is not a reliable source, and its statements should be treated accordingly.”

The HHS didn’t respond to repeated requests to explain the outburst.

It’s a stunning comment about the Africa CDC, the official health agency of the African Union, which represents 55 African nations. This isn’t some fly-by-night shell operation — it’sa health organization that served as the COVID-19 testing hub for 48 African countries at the outbreak of the pandemic, and which has coordinated millions of emergency vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from malaria to mpox.

In October, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC signed a landmark collaboration agreement to “consolidate their partnership” and “accelerate progress toward shared health goals.” Simply put, if there were any serious question of Africa CDC’s legitimacy, the WHO — a specialized agency of the United Nations — would not have signed off on this strategic agreement.

As for the HHS claiming the controversial study is still on, the Africa CDC tells us there’s a press conference this Thursday — so we’ll be watching.

            <h2>The CEO of Microsoft Suddenly Sounds Extremely Nervous About AI</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It sounds like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is already coming up with excuses in case the whole AI boom turns out to be a massive bust— which, by the way, he’s warning might come to pass.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, Nadella pontificated about what would constitute such a speculative bubble, and said that the long-term success of AI tech hinges on it being used across a broad range of industries — as well as seeing an uptick in adoption in the developing world where it’s not as popular, the Financial Times reports. If AI fails, in other words, it’s everyone else’s fault for not using it.

Nadella explained the pitfalls the AI industry would need to avoid, perhaps betraying his own anxieties about its future.

“For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” Nadella said, as quoted by the FT. The “tell-tale sign of if it’s a bubble,” he added, would be if only tech companies were benefitting from the rise of AI. He gave the example of a pharmaceutical company using AI to accelerate drug trials; it doesn’t need to be used to discover the “magical molecule,” but provide some other tangible, less extraordinary benefit to developing the product.

Nadella is adamant that these kinds of boosts that AI provides will justify AI and carry the industry, stressing less spectacular and more practical applications of the tech.

“I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, and bend the productivity curve, and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he proclaimed.

Nadella’s anxiety-tinged and more mundane-sounding forecasts for AI’s future comes as he’s been notably defensive about AI lately, as Microsoft reaffirms its commitment to spend tens of billions more on data centers and other AI-related costs. Earlier this month, he begged the public to stop using the term “slop,” the rapidly accepted new lingo for describing the shoddy text, images, and videos churned out by AI models, which Merriam-Webster crowned word of the year. Nadella’s thesis seemed to be that we should stop being mean about AI as it refines its “jagged edges” — which could take a while, by his own admission.

He isn’t alone in tamping down his promises for AI as a cloud of uncertainty looms over the industry, with experts continuing to raise the specter of AI progress hitting a wall, and noting that years into the AI boom, the tech still hasn’t yielded meaningful gains in productivity. Many tech CEOs not named Elon Musk have tried to pretend that they haven’t been using the pursuit of building a fabled artificial general intelligence, or AGI, as the rallying cry for the industry this whole time, as the idea of creating such a system that surpasses human intelligence seems more and more far fetched in the immediate term.

Striking a similar tone, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar declared that the company will focus on “practical adoption” of AI in 2026, and “how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day.” ChatGPT users will soon get a first hand look of what this pivot to practical economics looks like: last week, the company announced that free users will start being targeted with sponsored ads and content based on their conversations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, NASA announced that it had to cancel a scheduled spacewalk, citing a “medical situation” affecting a “single crew member who is stable” on board the International Space Station.

The mystery illness eventually led to the space agency staging the first medical evacuation in 25 years of continuous operation on board the aging orbital outpost, rushing four astronauts back to Earth in a move that brought the station’s number of occupants from seven to a skeleton crew of just three.

While the medical incident only affected a single astronaut, who has yet to be identified for privacy reasons, all four members of the Crew-11 mission cut their time on board the ISS short by weeks, safely splashing down off the coast of San Diego early Thursday morning.

The four astronauts were airlifted to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to a January 16 statement. After being “released as expected,” they continued their journey to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will “continue standard postflight reconditioning and evaluations.”

Do you know anything about what caused the evacuation from the ISS? Drop us a line at tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.

“All crew members remain stable,” the space agency reassured. “To protect the crew’s medical privacy, no specific details regarding the condition or individual will be shared.”

It’s an exceedingly rare event, highlighting the challenges inherent to providing healthcare in space. While hundreds of miles above the surface, specialized care is hard, if not impossible, to execute. While astronauts undergo rigorous EMT-level training so they can respond to emergencies on board the station, they aren’t full-blown medical professionals, and can only do so much under the direction of doctors back on Earth.

There’s a lot to still learn about providing care during medical emergencies, particularly when it comes to long-duration space exploration missions into deep space. According to a 2022 study, there still are plenty of “gaps in knowledge regarding the potential for unanticipated in-flight medical events to affect crew health and capacity, and potentially compromise mission success.”

As researchers from Northumbria University in Newcastle point out in a recent essay for The Conversation, medical emergencies are remarkably rare on the ISS, despite being expected to occur on average every three years. Studies have shown that the most common health issues astronauts experience are skin irritation, congestion, disruptions to sleep, and in-flight injuries — most of which are ironically caused by exercise, which is designed to protect astronauts’ long-term health.

Spending prolonged periods in a microgravity environment has also been shown to affect astronauts’ vision and blood pressure.

Now that there’s finally been a medical emergency on the station, though, it’s unclear whether the public — or even the broader medical community — will ever find out any details.

            <div id="article-text">Anybody who’s regularly driven in winter conditions knows the importance of keeping windshield washer fluid topped up. Keeping the salty grime stuck to your windshield and rear window to a minimum is crucial for visibility, especially in inclement weather.

In the case of an autonomously operating vehicle, ensuring visibility for the vehicle’s sensors could similarly be a matter of life and death. That’s particularly true for Tesla’s Cybercab ride-hailing vehicles, which rely entirely on camera feeds. Recent sightings of an early prototype in Chicago — a city known for its harsh and long winters — suggest the EV maker is taking the matter seriously, opting to install a rear-facing camera washer to keep obstructions to a minimum.

Images of the salt-covered prototype show liquid — presumably windshield washing liquid or antifreeze — dripping down its rear bumper, almost as if it had a runny nose.

The design change suggests the Elon Musk-led company is taking active measures to ensure its Cybercabs can operate in actual winter outside of its home states of California and Texas.

Tesla is hoping to expand its autonomous Robotaxi system in cities across the country. In November, the company announced that Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and Miami are next. Why the cab was spotted in Chicago remains unclear.

However, others lamented the fact that the company’s EV lineup, which has since been seemingly relegated to the bottom of the company’s priority list, had yet to benefit from a similar washer system, despite being on sale for many years now. Rear camera washer systems are a common feature among many production vehicles from other carmakers.

“This is a feature that many Tesla owners have been asking for, especially in snowy areas,” tweeted automotive journalist Sawyer Merritt. “Hope it makes it to the rest of the lineup.”

Tesla first showed off its Cybercab during a flashy event in October 2024. The odd design sparked a heated discussion, with critics pointing out its diminutive size — it can only fit two passengers — as well as a possibly unrealistic target price, and plenty of far-reaching promises about wireless charging.

At the time, Musk promised that the vehicle would enter production in 2027. Then, during the company’s Q3 earnings call last year, he promised that volume production would instead be reached in 2026.

“At this point, I feel 100 percent confident that we can sell unsupervised full self-driving at a safety level much greater than human,” he told investors.

But given the state of the company’s EV software, which is still leading to plenty of collisions and near-misses even when the weather is playing along, the company has its work cut out to realize Musk’s ever-ambitious vision.

That’s particularly true when it comes to rolling out an autonomous ride-hailing service in places that experience extreme weather, from frozen-over roadways to a barrage of salt that can clog up vehicle sensors in a heartbeat.

Let’s hope Tesla is aware that keeping the antifreeze topped up will be far more mission-critical than one might think.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2021, a crew of self-described free speech martyrs announced they were founding a university to save American higher education from the scourge of cancel culture. They called it the University of Austin, or UATX — and though it lacks accreditation, they boasted that it would be a place where controversial ideas could breathe free, and students wouldn’t live in fear of the woke mob.

Pretty much from the jump, critics of UATX suspected the project was less about “freedom of speech” and more about building a right-wing echo chamber for aggrieved libertarians. It operated out of a former retail store in downtown Austin, with funding from “anti-woke” philanthropists like Palantir co-founder Joseph Lonsdale.

Over the next few years, those critics would be proven correct in spectacular style. According to comprehensive reporting by Politico, in April of 2025 Lonsdale called an all-staff meeting that threw the entire project into a tailspin. Per the reporting, the billionaire told faculty and staff they must all subscribe to the “four principles of anti-communism, anti-socialism, identity politics, and anti-Islamism.” Anyone who didn’t toe the line would be frozen out.

In other words, the school supposedly founded to buck political litmus tests was issuing its own extremely stringent political litmus test — and threatening anyone who didn’t get on board with cancellation.

After that, everything changed. Staff and advisors began fleeing in droves. Students became disillusioned with the “university’s” mission. The founding president, Shakespeare scholar Pano Kanelos, stepped down from his role to take a largely ceremonial position as “Chancellor,” from which he would resign just a few months later.

One student told Politico: “I’ve never felt my speech was so chilled as it was in the classroom at UATX.”

Though a constitutional charter supposedly laid out a democratic process to resolve differences of opinion, these seemed to melt away at the request of figures like Lonsdale. The institution, as one staffer put it, had been “building the plane while we’re flying it.”

UATX, built to save students from the evils of cancel culture, has now become exactly what it claimed to oppose: an institution where the administration can end your academic career on a whim, where dissent from right-wing orthodoxy is not to be tolerated — and where the people most obsessed with cancel culture can finally do the cancelling.

            <h2>Elon Musk says Tesla’s restarted Dojo3 will be for ‘space-based AI compute’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/elon-musk-says-teslas-restarted-dojo3-will-be-for-space-based-ai-compute/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk said over the long weekend that Tesla aims to restart work on Dojo3, the electric vehicle company’s previously abandoned third-generation AI chip. Only this time, Dojo3 won’t be aimed at training self-driving models on Earth. Instead, Musk says it will be dedicated to “space-based AI compute.”

The move comes five months after Tesla effectively shut down its Dojo effort. The company disbanded the team behind its Dojo supercomputer following the departure of Dojo lead Peter Bannon. Around 20 Dojo workers also left to join DensityAI, a new AI infrastructure startup founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.

At the time of Dojo’s shutdown, Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to increase its reliance on Nvidia and other partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing, rather than continue developing its own custom silicon. Musk’s latest comments suggest the strategy has shifted again.

The billionaire executive and Republican megadonor said in a post on X the decision to revive Dojo was based on the state of its in-house chip roadmap, noting that Tesla’s AI5 chip design was “in good shape.”

Tesla’s AI5 chip, made by TSMC, was designed to power the automaker’s automated driving features and Optimus humanoid robots. Last summer, Tesla signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to build its AI6 chips that promise to power Tesla vehicles and Optimus, as well as enable high-performance AI training in data centers.

“AI7/Dojo3 will be for space-based AI compute,” Musk said on Sunday, positioning the resurrected project as more of a moonshot.

To achieve that, Tesla is now gearing up to rebuild the team it dismantled months ago. Musk used the same post to recruit engineers directly, writing: “If you’re interested in working on what will be the highest volume chips in the world, send a note to AI_Chips@Tesla.com with 3 bullet points on the toughest technical problems you’ve solved.”

The timing of the announcement is notable. At CES 2026, Nvidia unveiled Alpamayo, an open source AI model for autonomous driving that directly challenges Tesla’s FSD software. Musk commented on X that solving the long tail of rare edge cases in driving is “super hard,” adding: “I honestly hope they succeed.”

Musk and several other AI executives have argued the future of data centers may lie off-planet, since Earth’s power grids are already strained to the max. Axios recently reported Musk rival and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also excited by the prospect of putting data centers into orbit. Musk has an edge over his peers because he already controls the launch vehicles.

Per Axios, Musk plans to use SpaceX’s upcoming IPO to help finance his vision of using Starship to launch a constellation of compute satellites that can operate in constant sunlight, harvesting solar power 24/7.

Still, there are many roadblocks to making AI data centers in space a possibility, not least the challenge of cooling high-power compute in a vacuum. Musk’s comments of Tesla building “space-based AI compute” fit a familiar pattern: float an idea that sounds far-fetched, then try to brute-force it into reality.

            <h2>X open sources its algorithm while facing a transparency fine and Grok controversies</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/x-open-sources-its-algorithm-while-facing-a-transparency-fine-and-grok-controversies/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2023, the website then known as Twitter partially open sourced its algorithm for the first time. In those days, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk had only recently acquired the platform, and he claimed to be on a mission to restructure the social media platform to make it more transparent.

However, the algorithm’s code release was swiftly critiqued for being “transparency theater,” with critics noting that it was “incomplete,” and that it didn’t reveal much about the inner workings of the organization, or why the code worked the way that it did.

Now the site (rebranded as X) has open sourced its algorithm again, fulfilling a promise made by Musk last week. “We will make the new 𝕏 algorithm, including all code used to determine what organic and advertising posts are recommended to users, open source in 7 days,” he’d said. Musk also promised to provide transparency into the algorithm every four weeks for the foreseeable future.

In a post on GitHub on Tuesday, X provided an accessible write-up about its feed-generating code, along with a diagram of how the program works.

What has been revealed isn’t particularly earth-shattering — but it does provide a peek behind the algorithmic curtain. The diagram shows that, when sifting about for content to feed a particular user, the site’s algorithm considers their engagement history (what posts they’ve clicked on, etc.) and surveys recent in-network posts. It also conducts a machine-learning-based analysis of “out-of-network” posts — as in, content from accounts that the user doesn’t necessarily follow — that it believes the user might also find appealing.

The algorithm then filters out certain kinds of posts, including ones that come from blocked accounts or that are associated with muted keywords, as well as content that has been deemed too violent or spam-like. The algorithm then ranks this content based on what it thinks the user will find most appealing. This process considers factors like relevance and content diversity so users don’t just get a bunch of posts that are all alike. The algorithm also considers content according to the likelihood that the user will like it, reply to it, repost it, favorite it, or otherwise engage with it in some way.

This whole system is AI-based, according to X. The GitHub write-up released Tuesday notes that the system “relies entirely” on the company’s “Grok-based transformer” to “learn relevance from user engagement sequences.” In other words, Grok is looking at what you’re clicking and liking and feeding that information into the recommendation system. The write-up also notes that there is no “manual feature engineering for content relevance,” meaning humans don’t manually adjust how the algorithm determines what’s relevant. It adds that the automation “significantly reduces the complexity in our data pipelines and serving infrastructure.”

Why is X revealing all of this now? It’s not totally clear. In the past, Musk has claimed that he wants to make the platform an exemplar of corporate transparency — a theme that continues to today. In 2023, when the Twitter algorithm was first revealed, Musk said that providing “code transparency” would be “incredibly embarrassing at first” but would ultimately “lead to rapid improvement in recommendation quality.” He added: “Most importantly, we hope to earn your trust.” With its first code open sourcing, the platform proclaimed a “new era of transparency” for Twitter.

Though Musk has talked transparency, certain aspects of the platform have arguably grown less open since Musk took it over. When the tech billionaire bought Twitter in 2022, the site was notably forced to transition from a public company to a private one — an evolution that isn’t typically synonymous with openness. While the site used to release multiple transparency reports a year, X didn’t release its first transparency report until September of 2024. In December, X was also fined $140 million by European Union regulators who claimed that the site had violated “transparency obligations” under the Digital Services Act (DSA), and argued that the site’s verification check mark system had made it more difficult for users to judge the authenticity of particular accounts.

X has also been under pressure over the past month due to the ways in which its chatbot, Grok, have been used to create and distribute sexualized content. The California Attorney General’s office and congressional lawmakers have both scrutinized the platform in recent weeks, citing claims that Grok has been used to create naked images of women and minors. As a result, some may view this appeal to openness as just more theater.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell has agreed to accept an electronic subpoena for information on his phone related to the company, as part of the lidar maker’s ongoing bankruptcy proceeding, per a new filing Tuesday.

Russell now has seven days to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or object to it — otherwise he has 14 days to comply, according to the filing.

The agreement comes two weeks after Luminar’s lawyers accused Russell of avoiding the subpoena by turning away process servers at the gate to his Florida mansion. Russell had argued he was unwilling to turn over his phone until he received assurances from Luminar that his personal information would be protected; the Tuesday filing shows the two sides agreed to hash out exact steps on how that information will be handled.

Luminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December after losing major contracts with customers like Volvo and Mercedes-Benz, as well as rising competition from lidar companies in China.

Luminar reached a deal last week with a company called Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI) to sell its lidar assets for $22 million. (Luminar is also trying to sell its semiconductor division to QCI for $110 million.) Luminar has scheduled an auction for the end of this month in an attempt to solicit bids that might beat QCI’s offer.

Russell tried to buy Luminar in October, months after his abrupt resignation as CEO due to an ethics inquiry, but before the company filed for bankruptcy. Representatives for his new venture, Russell AI Labs, have told TechCrunch that he remains interested in submitting a bid for Luminar’s lidar assets, but a formal offer has not yet been submitted.

Luminar has been seeking information from Russell since his resignation as it decides whether to take legal action against him. The founder has already turned over multiple computers but held on to his phone because of privacy concerns. (Luminar originally claimed it was seeking two phones from Russell, one provided by the company and one personal. Russell has since said in court filings that he only ever had one phone during his time at Luminar.)

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Serve Robotics, the sidewalk delivery robot company backed by Nvidia and Uber, is expanding into a new category with its latest acquisition: healthcare.

Los Angeles-based Serve Robotics announced Tuesday it was acquiring Diligent Robotics, a startup that builds robots named Moxi designed to assist in hospitals by delivering lab samples, supplies, and other tasks. The deal values Diligent’s common stock at $29 million.

Diligent Robotics was founded in 2017 by Andrea Thomaz and Vivian Chu and has raised more than $75 million in venture capital — most recently raising a $25 million funding round in 2023.

The acquisition marks Serve’s first foray beyond its food-delivery roots. The sidewalk delivery robots company was incubated inside food delivery company Postmates in 2017. The project continued after Uber bought Postmates, before spinning off in 2021. Serve went public in April 2024 via a reverse merger.

Serve co-founder and CEO Ali Kashani doesn’t view the acquisition as a big deviation from the company’s initial target.

While the company hasn’t focused specifically on healthcare thus far, how Diligent’s robot Moxi operates does fit squarely into the company’s thesis around last-mile delivery and robots that can navigate alongside humans, Kashani told TechCrunch in a recent interview.

“This is a kind of a classic example of a prepared mind meets opportunity,” Kashani said. “Robots that are moving among people is the broader opportunity for us. Once you solve the problem, which is how to get robots to seamlessly move among people as autonomous machines, then you can bring it to a lot of other environments. We knew that we wanted to do this someday.”

Healthcare wasn’t a specific goal for expansion either, Kashani said, but rather the companies were introduced at the perfect time. Diligent was looking to scale and Serve was opportunistically looking into new areas.

“We love the team; they have very similar DNA to us, which is, rather than building in a lab, they build in real life,” Kashani said. “It just seems like it’s really aligned with our mission.”

Diligent will continue to operate relatively independently within Serve, Kashani said. Diligent will tap into Serve’s software and tools to help them work toward scale and the companies will share tech and collaborate, he added.

Kashani said this isn’t a pivot for the company, nor does it mean that Serve is looking to acquire more startups, he added. Kashani, who emphasized that Serve is still very focused on its sidewalk-delivery robots, said they would “keep our eyes open” for interesting companies as potential partners, not necessarily acquisition targets.

Serve was able to grow its fleet of robots in 2025 from 100 to more than 2,000, he said. The company also signed a partnership with DoorDash to facilitate some of their deliveries in Los Angeles in October.

“Our sidewalk business is what’s fueling everything,” Kashani said. “It’s creating the technology. It’s one of the largest autonomous fleets in the world right now and developing that helps us create everything that we need in other applications.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two members of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency may have accessed and shared Social Security numbers in an effort to help an advocacy group “overturn election results in certain States” last year, according to court documents.

The revelation, which was first reported by Politico, comes as part of a series of corrections to previous testimony by top Social Security Administration officials related to legal battles over DOGE’s access to Social Security data.

Neither the two DOGE members, nor the advocacy group, are named in the court documents.

In March 2025, a political advocacy group contacted two members of the DOGE team at the Social Security Administration (SSA) “with a request to analyze state voter rolls that the advocacy group had acquired,” Elizabeth Shapiro, a Justice Department official, wrote in the court documents.

“The advocacy group’s stated aim was to find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States,” said Shapiro.

Shapiro wrote that after these communications, one of the DOGE members, as an SSA employee, signed and sent a “Voter Data Agreement” with the advocacy group.

The DOGE members may have accessed private information that was ruled to be off-limits by a court at the time, and shared data on unapproved “third-party” servers.

“At this time, there is no evidence that SSA employees outside of the involved members of the DOGE Team were aware of the communications with the advocacy group. Nor were they aware of the ‘Voter Data Agreement’,” Shapiro wrote.

It’s unclear if the two DOGE members ended up sharing the data, according to Shapiro, but emails “suggest that DOGE Team members could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls.”

According to Shapiro, the SSA referred the two DOGE employees for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits federal workers from leveraging their official positions for political activities.

Last year, a federal judge issued an order to block DOGE’s members access to SSA’s systems, which included SSNs, medical records, drivers’ license numbers, tax information, and other types of personal information. Later on, an SSA whistleblower alleged that DOGE uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records to a vulnerable cloud server.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Online mentoring site UStrive has resolved a security lapse that exposed the personal information of its users, including children.

The exposed data included the full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other non-public and user-provided information of UStrive users, which was accessible to any other logged-in user.

The nonprofit, previously known as Strive for College, provides online mentorship to high school and college students through its platform. The organization would not say whether it plans to inform users about the security incident.

Last week, a person who asked not to be named alerted TechCrunch to the security flaw on UStrive’s mentoring platform. By examining the network traffic while signed in and navigating the site — such as viewing user profiles — anyone could see streams of users’ personal information in their browser tools.

The person said that UStrive was relying on a vulnerable Amazon-hosted GraphQL endpoint — a type of query database interface — that allowed access to reams of user data stored on UStrive’s servers. Some user records contained more data than others, including information provided by the student, such as their gender and date of birth. The person said that there were at least 238,000 user records at the time of discovery. UStrive meanwhile states on its home page that more than “1.1 million students have opted in for a UStrive mentor.”

TechCrunch confirmed the data exposure after creating a new user account on UStrive, and notified the company’s executives by email on Thursday.

John D. McIntyre, an attorney with Virginia law firm McIntyre Stein, which is representing UStrive, said in a letter provided to TechCrunch later on Thursday that UStrive is “currently in litigation with one of its former software engineers,” and as such the company is “somewhat limited in its ability to respond.”

TechCrunch told McIntyre that the company at that time still had a security lapse exposing the private and personal information of children, and asked McIntyre to notify TechCrunch if UStrive planned to fix the data exposure, and if so, by when.

In response to TechCrunch’s initial outreach, UStrive chief technology officer Dwamian Mcleish told TechCrunch by email late on Thursday that the exposure had been “remediated.”

TechCrunch sent Mcleish follow-up emails with more questions about the incident, including: whether the company plans to notify its users about the security lapse, whether the company has the ability to check if there was any improper or malicious access to users’ data, and whether the company’s platform had undergone a security audit and, if so, by whom.

UStrive founder Michael J. Carter did not comment for this article.

            <h2>What We Learned About Trump This Past Year</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Donald Trump retains the ability to shock; the day he loses that, he will, like the biblical Samson—another man notable for his coiffure—lose his power entirely. When Trump started his second term as president a year ago, however, I doubted whether there was much more to learn about how his mind works. Even before he’d entered politics, Trump was overexposed. Since then, he has become the most scrutinized person in the world. His tendencies and foibles are well known to voters, politicians, and world leaders.

Yet in breaking one of his most entrenched patterns, he has provided perhaps the biggest surprise of the past year. During his first term, Trump was defined by his tendency to back down in any negotiation or fight: As I put it in a May 2018 article, he almost always folded, agreeing to concessions whether he was negotiating on trade with China or a budget resolution with Senate Democrats. More recently, though, he’s been following through, no matter how aberrant his ideas. The exact reason for this is difficult to pin down, though it likely includes the fact that he has more experience under his belt, fewer prudent voices in his ear, and a lame duck’s liberation from having to worry about reelection. In any case, his new determination is forcing countries around the world to reassess how to deal with him.

Nowhere is this so clear right now as with Trump’s continued pressure to acquire Greenland. In the wee hours of this morning, Trump went on a social-media spree, posting (among other things) an illustration of himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and J. D. Vance planting a U.S. flag in Greenland. European leaders seem to slowly be coming to the conclusion that this isn’t just a feint.

When the president began making noise about taking the Danish territory early last year, many observers were baffled but not necessarily all that concerned—an impulse reinforced when the matter receded from Trump’s attention in the months that followed. They also had a long track record to draw on. In May 2017, I wrote that “foreign leaders have realized Trump is a pushover.” This held true for adversaries (China) and allies (Taiwan, NATO) alike throughout his first term.

It was especially true for rivals such as Russia and North Korea. Trump talked a fierce game—promising “fire and fury” for Pyongyang, for example—but his counterparts understood that despite his insistence that he was a master dealmaker, all they needed was to get him to a negotiating table. “Faced with a tough decision, the president has consistently blinked, giving in to his opponents,” I wrote in my 2018 article.

This pattern was clear enough that when Trump refused to concede the 2020 election, even his allies were dismissive. “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” a senior Republican official told The Washington Post in November 2020. “It’s not like he’s plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on January 20.” That was exactly what he was doing, however ham-handedly. The effort to subvert the election was also a warning of things to come.

Even so, Trump’s return to office initially suggested more of the same tendency to back down. This past May (why is it always May?), I wrote about Wall Street’s “TACO trade”—short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”—in which stock traders bet against the president following through on tariff threats and then profiting when he folded and markets went up. And they were right, to an extent: Although Trump did impose extensive tariffs, the eventual levels were much lower than initially announced, thanks in part to lobbying by foreign governments. Trump’s resolve remains weak in some areas; he’s swung wildly on Ukraine and Russia, his position shifting depending on whom he last spoke to.

But in other ways, the pattern has started to break. Just ask Nicolás Maduro, who reportedly rejected negotiated exile in Turkey, perhaps wagering that Trump would never actually launch a military strike on Venezuela to capture him. It was a bad bet. Now Trump seems energized and has turned his attention to Greenland. U.S. allies—or people who until recently thought of themselves as allies—are scrambling to figure out how to react. Can they draw things out long enough for Trump to lose interest? Can they appease him somehow? Or do they need, as Eliot Cohen argued in The Atlantic this past weekend, to show a willingness to resist the United States militarily?

Trump is acting emboldened domestically too. He is once again threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to Minneapolis, where he seems determined to immiserate the entire city. Before his first term, Trump had threatened to prosecute political rivals, but he was stymied by his aides during his presidency. This time, he’s going through with it. In a New Yorker profile this week of Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat charged with assault for a fracas at an ICE facility, Representative Lateefah Simon, a California Democrat, said, “Typically, we would say, ‘Oh, they’re just trying to scare her.’” But this is much more than fearmongering: “They’re actively litigating this case,” Simon noted. (McIver has pleaded not guilty.)

Signs of new resistance have started to emerge in parallel with Trump’s newfound resolve. Republican members of Congress have begun pushing back—far less than one would expect even in a normal presidency, but more than in Trump’s previous term or in the early days of this one. They were able to force his hand on the Epstein files, though whether they have the courage to hold him to account for slow-walking the files’ release is not yet clear. As my colleague Anne Applebaum wrote yesterday, Congress will need to do much more to halt any Greenland fiasco. Foreign leaders will need to take a harder line too. When Trump was a pushover, it was more understandable, if not wiser, to wonder, What is the downside of humoring him? Now the downsides are clear and dangerous.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Trump’s Golden Age of Culture Seems Pretty Sad So Far

Trump’s return to office was widely portrayed as christening a new definition of chic. Young voters and voters of color had swung in his direction, thanks partly to the influence of podcasts, livestreams, and other media formats that now compete with traditional news outlets and cultural institutions. The attendance of tech barons, comedians, and content creators at Trump’s inauguration indicated that the so-called alternative media was now the mainstream—and openly pro-Trump. Its touchstones appeared to be recently booming phenomena including country music, TikTok tradwives, and mixed martial arts.

Trump quickly began consolidating his cultural power by focusing on the old media that hadn’t fallen in line.

            <div id="article-text">In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.

            <h2>The Real Reason for the Drop in Fentanyl Overdoses</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/opioid-overdose-decrease-fentanyl-china/685683/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For two decades, the United States and Canada have struggled with a drug epidemic. From 2003 to 2022, annual overdose deaths in the United States rose from less than 26,000 to nearly 108,000—becoming the leading nonmedical cause of death, surpassing car accidents and gun violence combined. In Canada, overdose deaths increased almost tenfold in the same period. In both countries, the surge in deaths was supercharged by “synthetic” opioids such as fentanyl, the ultra-potent, lab-made narcotic that has come to dominate the supply of hard drugs.

Then, sometime in 2023, something miraculous happened: Death rates started dropping. In Canada, opioid-overdose deaths declined 17 percent in 2024, then continued falling sharply in the first six months of 2025 (the most recent months for which data are available). In America, preliminary data indicate that total drug deaths fell from their peak of just shy of 113,000 in the year ending August 2023 to about 73,000 in the year ending August 2025.

Although the numbers are still too high, the public-health community has responded to the decrease with jubilation—and confusion. Overdoses had been rising inexorably for 20 years. What changed?

A new paper, published earlier this month by a group of drug-policy scholars in the journal Science, presents a novel theory. The paper’s authors attribute the reversal not to any American or Canadian policy, but to a sudden fentanyl “drought,” which they say may have its causes not in North America, but in China.

Nick Miroff: Fentanyl doesn’t come through the Caribbean

If right, their conclusion implies a disheartening lesson amid the otherwise-welcome news. Nothing American or Canadian policy makers did—no amount of law enforcement, harm reduction, or opioid-settlement funds—made deaths start falling, the paper implies. America and Canada’s drug problem might be in China’s hands.

The paper’s authors draw on a variety of data—drug potency, law-enforcement actions, and, cleverly, social-media posts—to study the supply of fentanyl over time. Most of what drug dealers sell on the street isn’t 100 percent pure fentanyl. Instead, dealers usually adulterate their drugs, combining fentanyl with inert powders such as sugar and baby powder, or mixing in other drugs to stretch the active ingredient. Recent years, for example, have seen a major increase in adulteration with the horse tranquilizer xylazine, which knocks users out but doesn’t satisfy the opioid craving. Such adulteration happens because users expect to pay the same amount for their drugs every time; dealers vary how much fentanyl they get for their dollar depending on how available the drug is. When purity goes down, it means the availability of fentanyl has, too.

Using data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the paper’s authors observe that when overdose deaths began falling in mid-2023, the measured purity of fentanyl sold on the street began falling roughly in tandem. By the end of 2024, the data show, both overdose deaths and powder purity had fallen by about 50 percent—a dramatic concurrence.

The authors also look at DEA data on law-enforcement seizures of fentanyl, finding that these also slowed in the third quarter of 2023. This, they argue, is less attributable to any sort of strategy or personnel change and more to the fact that there appears to have been less fentanyl for law enforcement to seize. The authors also say that Canadian data, to the extent they are available, are consistent with this trend.

To further explore the possibility that fentanyl supply was plummeting, the authors also decided to look to an unusual source of data: Reddit forums dedicated to drugs‚ such as r/fentanyl. From 2021 to early 2023, “droughts” were rarely mentioned at all. But beginning in late 2023, the term drought starts showing up in dozens of posts a month, an increase of as much as 1,900 percent. In other words: Users were noticing a supply crash, too.

Droughts have been known to reduce overdose deaths. For example, Australia experienced a significant “heroin drought” in 2001. According to a 2024 study, the drought cut opioid-overdose deaths by somewhere from 36 to 56 percent among a cohort of people using illicit opioids.

But if a fentanyl drought had come to North America, what was causing it? The paper’s authors suggest that the answer may be related to a 2023 China crackdown on fentanyl-precursor chemicals and the online platforms that sold them, itself following a summit between President Biden and Xi Jinping. That crackdown in turn may have made it harder for Mexican producers, who usually source their precursors from the Chinese gray market, to manufacture the drug. But that’s more of a speculation than a definitive answer, Jonathan Caulkins, a professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author of the paper, told me.

“I’m much more comfortable with the idea that supply has become less abundant,” Caulkins said, adding that he’s fundamentally “puzzled what it was that could have produced such a long-lasting reduction.”

Clearer than what caused the drought is what didn’t cause it. As deaths fell, many pointed to their preferred policies. Nora Volkow, the longtime director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, attributed the decline to the increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, as well as steps taken by Congress and the Biden administration to make opioid-addiction medication more available. The Biden DEA administrator Anne Milgram claimed law enforcement’s share of the credit, saying her agency had successfully put “pressure” on the cartels.

These explanations were never that convincing. Reducing drug deaths through enforcement is notoriously hard. Naloxone seems to have had no discernible effect on fentanyl deaths, though it has reduced deaths caused by other, less potent opioids. And a massive study that deployed both harm-reduction and treatment interventions across 67 communities from 2021 to 2022 yielded no statistically significant reduction in overdose deaths. These approaches all might make small differences, but they can’t explain the big drop.

Nor, the paper’s authors note, can they explain the glaring fact that overdose deaths went down in both the United States and Canada, which have very different drug-control-policy approaches. “Both countries, despite very different policies, seem to be riding the same wave of broad trends in supply and use,” Caulkins said. Which leaves American and Canadian policy makers with something of a disappointing victory: Deaths are down, but they may yet come back, and preventing that turn may be far beyond American and Canadian control.

Listen: A radical answer to the fentanyl crisis

Though we don’t know why the drought happened, it still offers opportunity. In 2019, a multiagency operation shut down a handful of drug gangs in Philadelphia’s Kensington drug market at once, effectively imposing a drought through policy. A rigorous study later concluded that overdose deaths fell as a result, and the use of addiction-treatment medication in the surrounding Delaware Valley—an area covering parts of three states—increased. When their supply dries up, some people get off drugs; now is a great time to help them.

But there are risks, too. An uncertain drug supply can drive some users to substitute other substances—xylazine, or the latest illicit tranquilizer, medetomidine—that are dangerous in their own right. And sudden drops in the availability of opioids can reduce chronic users’ tolerance, leading them to take too much and overdose when the drugs come back.

If we want to lock in the unexpected windfall from the drought, now is the time to focus on getting people clean. That’s a big lift, but the right combination of medication, therapy, and voluntary and involuntary treatment can make a difference. If we do nothing, though, then one day fentanyl will come back—and there will be little anyone can do.</div>

            <h2>America’s Would-Be Surgeon General Says to Trust Your ‘Heart Intelligence’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/casey-means-surgeon-general-religion-spirituality/685682/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past year, the United States has gone without its doctor. Ever since Vivek Murthy resigned as surgeon general last January, the role has remained empty despite President Trump’s attempts to fill it. He first nominated the physician Janette Nesheiwat but withdrew her nomination in May after reports that she completed her M.D. not in Arkansas, as she had claimed, but in St. Maarten. In her place, Trump nominated Casey Means, whose background is odd, to say the least.

Means is a Stanford Medicine graduate who dropped out of her surgical residency and has since made a career infusing spiritual beliefs into her wellness company, social-media accounts, and best-selling book. The exact nature of her spirituality is hard to parse: Means adopts an anti-institutionalist, salad-bar approach. She might share Kabbalah or Buddhist teachings, or quote Rumi or the movie Moana. She has written about speaking to trees and participating in full-moon ceremonies, both of which drew ridicule by the conservative activist and unofficial Trump adviser Laura Loomer. Her belief in “the divine feminine” (which she doesn’t quite explain) seems to have led her to renounce hormonal birth-control pills for halting the “cyclical life-giving nature of women.”

Although months have passed since her nomination, Means has still not appeared before Congress—in part because she went into labor with her first child hours before her confirmation hearing was scheduled to begin. (Means did not respond to questions for this story. A spokesperson for Bill Cassidy, who chairs the relevant Senate committee, told me that “the hearing will be rescheduled in the future when Dr. Means is ready” but did not offer a more detailed timeline.) The United States’ year without a surgeon general raises questions about how necessary the role really is. But the surgeon general still serves as the government’s leading spokesperson on public health, and if Means is eventually confirmed, her theology will become rather consequential because it is deeply tied to her beliefs about health. In 2024, she declared in a Senate roundtable on chronic disease that “what we are dealing with here is so much more than a physical health crisis. This is a spiritual crisis.” Part of her solution to both of these crises is to reject experts and institutions in favor of something far more alluring: intuition.

Means wrote in 2024 that she grew up in the Catholic faith, but left the Church in college. She grew fascinated by lectures at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine, a spiritual center in Pacific Palisades, California. SRF, the religious organization behind it, was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, the “father of yoga in the West,” whose image graced the album cover of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. It accepts the teachings of Jesus and other spiritual masters and divinities, but nothing is seemingly as important as one’s personal relationship with God. Yogananda’s book, The Second Coming of Christ, posits that the Second Coming is not necessarily literal, but instead entails an awakening of the divine consciousness in ourselves.

SRF’s influence is apparent in Means’s advice that people follow their “heart intelligence” and “divine intuition” and avoid “blindly ‘trusting the science.’” In a newsletter sponsored by a probiotic-supplement company, she wrote that “applying the scientific method to health and disease has immense utility for helping us understand the natural world and live healthy, longer lives, but it feels increasingly like there is a campaign being enacted against our divine gifts of intuition and heart intelligence.” In another newsletter, she wrote about the role of divine intuition in deciding whether to drink raw milk: She wants to be free to look a local farmer in the eye, “pet his cow, and then decide if I feel safe to drink the milk from his farm.” (One could very well have a lovely experience with a farmer, Kevin Klatt, a registered dietitian and research scientist at UC Berkeley, told me, “but it isn’t going to change the fact that raw milk might give you listeria.”)

In the same newsletter championing bovine contact, Means laments a spiritual crisis of connection to nature. She frequently portrays nature as a force with humanity’s best interests at heart, nearly synonymous with God. In her book, she suggests that chronic stress and trauma can be treated by, among other things, spending time in nature and through “plant medicine”—specifically, psilocybin-assisted therapy. (Means has also written that psychedelics helped her be “one with the moon.”) In that sponsored newsletter, she warned of a prophecy she says was put forth by the Indigenous Kogi people of Colombia, in which humanity has only until 2026 to prove we want to right the wrongs we have foisted upon the Earth, or we will all die. “I use the Kogi prophecy metaphorically,” she wrote. “But I do feel we are on a road to disaster. I think we should take these messages seriously.” Natural disasters, she implied, are a “communication from God.”

Nature worship might be especially appealing at a time when trust in experts is declining and technology has become ever more inscrutable and overwhelming, Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religion at James Madison University and the author of Natural: How Faith in Nature’s Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws, and Flawed Science, told me. Means’s appeal to nature and intuition, he said, is empowering because it puts expertise back into everyday Americans’ hands.

The ambiguity of Means’s spiritual views strengthens her appeal—they can be interpreted to fit a wide array of belief systems. Her 2024 New York Times best seller, Good Energy, uses terms such as energy and life force, along with scientific-sounding descriptions of metabolic processes, to insinuate that the vibes are off in the American diet and lifestyle. (Means wrote Good Energy with her brother, Calley, who is now a close adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services.) In her newsletter, she encourages her readers to “avoid conventionally grown foods at all costs,” and warns that buying nonorganic food is a vote to “diminish the life force on this planet” while the use of synthetic pesticides “is giving a poor signal to God (Source!) that we want this miracle to continue.” (Source insinuates a godlike or all-powerful entity.) “She’s drawing on lots of different ideas very freely and without much rigor in ways that feel good,” Joseph Baker, a sociologist specializing in religion at East Tennessee State University, told me. “That sort of allows her to seem like a visionary without having to specify anything.”

Emily Hilliard, a press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in an email that religious and spiritual beliefs should not be held against anyone who seeks a government job, and that Means’s “credentials, research background, and experience in public life give her the right insights to be the surgeon general who helps make sure America never again becomes the sickest nation on earth.” The surgeon general has little power to enforce policy, but can call on Congress to put warnings on products like the ones seen on cigarette packets, release guidelines and reports, and lend support to various initiatives. Means’s belief system—which Baker characterized as a “sacralization of the individual”—suggests that she will use that platform to invite Americans to master their own health. In Good Energy, Means writes of chronic conditions such as depression, anxiety, infertility, insomnia, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, and cancer, “The ability to prevent and reverse these conditions—and feel incredible today—is under your control and simpler than you think.”

That statement is one of many in which Means echoes elements of manifestation: the belief that thinking good thoughts and putting in effort begets good things, which Means says is real. She advocates “tapping into the abundance that is a sheer law of our universe” and calling on a higher power—“When was the last time you simply sat quietly and asked God/spirit/ancestors/nature to help show you the way and guide you to your highest purpose?” she wrote in her newsletter—but also putting in the hard, hard work.

Means goes beyond intuition and heart intelligence to offer concrete suggestions for labor (and spending) that will be divinely rewarded—essentially, a reimagined prosperity gospel. The nature of that work is detailed in the penultimate section of Good Energy. Means recommends eating minimally processed and mostly organic foods, and taking regular cold plunges or showers. (In her newsletter, she also advises Americans to grow the majority of their food; instead of pets, they could “raise chickens and goats and have abundant eggs and milk.”) She includes checklists upon checklists of habits and tests that “enable Good Energy” (and recommends getting a comprehensive lab panel from Function Health, of which she was an investor). She suggests buying a glucose monitor through her own company, Levels, and also recommends various personal-care apps, water filters, and trackers for sleep, food, and activity. Some of these items are sold by the wellness company True Medicine, which helps customers use their health savings account for a wide range of purchases, and in which Means has invested; her brother co-founded it. According to financial disclosures made public in September, Means has also received more than $275,000 from supplement companies. (Means has pledged to divest from True Medicine and other wellness interests if she is confirmed.)

Besides potentially boosting her own bottom line, Means’s embrace of individualism in health is wholly unrealistic. Americans work longer hours than people in many other developed nations, and many don’t have enough time to cook dinner, let alone raise goats. Many of the most important nutrition victories over the past century, such as the fortification of foods and the removal of trans fats, were communal and systemic, Klatt, the dietitian and UC Berkeley researcher, told me—the type of science-backed, population-level interventions that Means hasn’t demonstrated much interest in. A different prospective surgeon general might recommend repeated visits with a dietitian and fight for insurance to cover them, instead of “advocating for this kind of woo-woo stuff that has no data behind it,” Klatt said. Means, though, “is not an individual who seems to be wedded to the scientific process,” Timothy Caulfield, a professor and the research director at the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta, told me. “This is someone who seems to pull things out of thin air and then look for sciencey-sounding rhetoric” to support them.

Perhaps Means’s eventual confirmation hearing will clarify what, exactly, she intends to do as the face of American public health. But even she may not be sure. “The future of medicine will be about light,” Means wrote to her newsletter subscribers last year, before admitting, “I don’t exactly know how yet.”</div>

            <h2>What Iranians Want From Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/trump-khamenei-iran-protests/685680/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Shahrzad went to demonstrate in the streets of Tehran on January 2, she was buoyed by one fact: The day before, President Trump had promised that if Iran killed protesters, “the United States of America will come to their rescue.”

“We were all so hopeful,” the 29-year-old woman, who left Iran a few days ago for a nearby country, told me. Like many of those I spoke with for this article, she used a pseudonym for fear of reprisals against her family. “But when Khamenei started threatening us the day after, we were shit-scared. What if they came to a deal with Trump over our heads?”

In the two weeks since, the Iranian regime has committed its biggest atrocity since the 1980s, killing at least 3,919 protesters, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activist News Agency. Trump has yet to act on his promises, though he has repeated them several times. Many hope he might still intervene. But Trump has also disheartened Iranians by downplaying the regime’s violence. On Friday, he puzzlingly thanked Iran’s leaders for allegedly halting their planned execution of 800 protesters.

Over the years, I’ve often sought the opinion of Iranians for or against foreign intervention. And it has long been a contentious question that’s sharply divided the opponents of the Islamic Republic. But posing this question to about a dozen Iranians in recent days has yielded answers that feel strikingly new. First, most of those I spoke with favored one form or another of intervention by the United States. Second, many favored what would have been unthinkable not long ago: for Trump to take out Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Melika, a 21-year-old Iranian student in Europe who left Iran a few weeks ago, strongly opposed the Israeli-American attacks on Iran last year. A socialist feminist who took part in the “Women, Life, Freedom” protests of 2022–23, she is generally skeptical of foreign intervention. But faced with the regime’s brutal violence over the past two weeks, she now can’t help but favor some kind of action from the U.S., especially given that Trump promised it.

“I’d frankly like Trump to kill Khamenei,” she told me. “I am worried about a broader war that would hurt Iran’s infrastructure. I wouldn’t like for us to become an Iraq, happy that Saddam is gone but becoming worse. But the Islamic Republic has to pay a price.” She speculated that killing Khamenei could heighten the power struggle inside the regime and perhaps stanch the repression and killing of protesters.

Mahsa Alimardani: How doubt became a weapon in Iran

Shahrzad told me that many of those who protested with her agreed. “The people of Iran would like to see a Venezuela-style operation,” she said, “even if it seems like a strange demand for Iran.”

She struggled to maintain her composure as we spoke. Two of her friends were killed last week, along with nine others known to her broader friend circle.

The sentiments of these young activists are shared by some internationally renowned opponents of the Iranian regime several decades their senior. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, the celebrated filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the scholar Mohammad Javad Akbarin, and four others issued an open letter calling for what they termed a “humanitarian intervention.”

Akbarin is a supporter of Mir Hossein Mousavi, the former prime minister of the Islamic Republic whose reformist candidacy for the presidency touched off the 2009 Green Movement. Mousavi has been under house arrest since 2011. Until a few years ago, for someone from his political corner to demand an American hit on Khamenei would have been unthinkable. But Akbarin, now based in London, told me: “Ali Khamenei’s elimination is a necessary condition for any change in Iran. If he stays in power, more people will be killed following the next protests.”

Akbarin opposes wider measures, such as striking the bases of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as Israel did in June. But he believes that taking out Khamenei would open a path for change, preferably led by domestic elements in Iran. “It will help us enter the transition period,” he said.

Gal Beckerman: The silence of the Left on Iran

Mostafa Saber, a Vancouver-based leader of a prominent left-wing Iranian party, does not share many political views with Akbarin but agreed with him on this point. “Regardless of what I think, many people in Iran want support from Trump,” he told me by phone. “They’d like him to hit Khamenei. This is what the people want. And if he does, this can benefit the revolution.”

Saber, too, doubts the utility of American military engagement beyond such an operation. “A broader military attack will help the Islamic Republic and hurt the revolution,” he said. “We oppose such intervention. An all-out war will surely benefit the Islamic Republic. They will militarize the atmosphere.”

He pointed to this past summer’s 12-day war with the U.S. and Israel, which paused domestic actions, such as a nationwide truck-driver strike that was then under way. “But to take out Khamenei,” as Trump did with the IRGC leader Qassem Soleimani, “is a different matter,” he said. “Khamenei’s loss will take cohesion out of the Islamic Republic and will add to the people’s morale.”

Some activists have a different view of what sort of action Trump should take, however. Ali Vakili, an activist in New York City with extensive contacts in Iran, expressed reservations about an American hit on Khamenei. The supreme leader “shouldn’t be a martyr,” Vakili told me. “The people of Iran should decide his fate themselves.”

Vakili told me that he’d rather see the U.S. hit IRGC bases, and that “U.S. jets should remain in Iranian skies for a while” so that people might feel that the United States is really behind them. Maybe such a threat could force the regime to change its behavior—or even lead it to transition Khamenei and those close to him out of power in favor of more technocratic elements.

The consensus for foreign intervention among those I spoke with was wider spread and more politically diverse than ever before, in my experience, but it was by no means unanimous. Elahe Ejbari, a student activist who fled Iran in 2022, started a counterpetition to the one that Ebadi and Akbarin signed. Ejbari’s petition supports the people’s movement against the regime but declares that “tying the destiny of Iranian popular struggles to foreign intervention is dangerous and irresponsible.”

Arash Azizi: Change may be coming to Iran

“History shows us that foreign intervention in the global South will never lead to freedom,” she told me by phone from Germany. Even a direct hit on Khamenei, she said, “will only make the region more insecure.”

Another statement, signed by 14 luminaries including the popular journalist and scholar Alireza Rajaee, condemns both the regime’s violence and “any foreign intervention in our dear country Iran.” It warns that unless “fundamental peaceful change” is brought about by Iran’s rulers, “more difficult changes will become inevitable.”

Ultimately, Iran’s next chapter will be the outcome not only of what America does or does not do but also of the interactions among regional actors, protesters, and the regime’s web of factions. How these will unfold is all but impossible to predict.

But one thing is clear. Until a few years ago, millions of Iranians repeatedly voted in the country’s mostly unfree elections, hoping that regime insiders could pave a path for reform. They wouldn’t have dreamed of demanding change from American bombers or drones, or of asking the U.S. president to please kill the supreme leader for them.

Khamenei’s obstinate refusal to effect any meaningful change and his bloody massacre of civilians in droves have brought Iranians to this point. The grand ayatollah has brought them only death, disaster, and misery, and so they are desperately seeking a way out—by any means necessary.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Attack on Democracy Is Faltering</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/american-democracy-signs-life/685678/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The past year has been an annus horribilis for American democracy. Donald Trump launched an assault on any source of authority besides himself—prosecuting his political enemies, punishing dissenters both in and out of government, and following his own impulses regardless of law or norms. As the first year of Trump’s second term drew to a close, the administration launched an operation to arrest the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro without bothering to seek congressional assent, doubled down on its obsession with seizing Greenland, and proclaimed “absolute immunity” for the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Top experts in authoritarianism now contend that America can no longer be characterized as a democracy.

And yet, the prognosis for democracy in the United States is far better today than it was at the start of Trump’s second term, when Elon Musk’s DOGE was stripping the federal government for parts and even normally sober observers began talking seriously about the constitutional crises that would follow if Trump defied the Supreme Court. Since then, American democracy has started to show signs of life: The popularity Trump enjoyed after the election has vanished, protesters have marched in record numbers to oppose his one-man rule, and citizens have shown up to defend their neighbors from immigration enforcement and other federal forces. That bravery has helped encourage opposition politicians to take more and more forceful stands. District judges, meanwhile, continue to throw up roadblocks to the president’s plans.

None of this means that American democracy as we know it will survive—especially given the threat of Trump’s potential interference in the 2026 and 2028 elections—but it has a pulse. As Trump’s term goes on, the administration appears less capable of establishing durable authoritarian rule, and the possibility that the nation will find a way through the chaos with self-government intact no longer seems quite as remote. “In normal liberal democracy terms, the United States is in bad shape,” the international-relations scholar Nicholas Grossman wrote recently. But, he went on, considering that the country is struggling against an attempted authoritarian takeover, “we’re doing pretty well.”

Jonathan Lemire: Trump is suddenly looking a lot smaller

Some of Trump’s troubles are of his own making: He pushed too far, too fast. During his first term, the president found himself stymied by aides and civil servants who tried to limit the damage caused by his whims. He learned his lesson—this time around, he has staffed his administration with sycophants eager to cast out anyone who objects. Yet this assault on professionalism has also undermined Trump’s ability to get what he wants, because nobody left will tell him that what he wants is impossible, deeply unpopular, or both. Vox’s Zack Beauchamp describes this mode of governance as “haphazardism,” a form of authoritarianism that is “poorly executed and even self-undermining.”

Consider Trump’s attempt to bring meritless criminal cases against his political opponents, a longtime desire blocked by Justice Department leadership during his first term. This time, Attorney General Pam Bondi has gone along with efforts to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—but the department handled the cases so sloppily that a district court has already thrown them out. Courts have barred similarly slapdash efforts to appoint a slate of Trump-friendly prosecutors, harass law firms the president dislikes, withhold federal funding from a range of institutions, and deploy the National Guard to peaceful cities despite opposition from blue-state governors. That said, judicial defiance has been more pronounced in the lower courts. The Supreme Court has proved disturbingly willing to rubber-stamp the administration’s actions, with the exception of its recent ruling barring Trump’s use of the National Guard.

The administration similarly overreached with its campaign to oust Jimmy Kimmel from his late-night ABC spot over a joke about the Republican Party’s eagerness to use Charlie Kirk’s death to “score political points.” Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was too enthusiastic in publicly pressuring Disney, ABC’s parent company, to suspend Kimmel’s show. The heavy-handedness provoked a public backlash, and Disney, faced with skyrocketing rates of subscription cancellations, reinstated the late-night host. On immigration enforcement—Trump’s signature issue—the brutality and clumsiness of the mass-deportation campaign has decreased public support for the president’s agenda and increased the number of Americans who strongly disapprove of ICE.

As Trump began to struggle, the opposition found its voice. His military parade in June was countered by millions of protesters who gathered at “No Kings” demonstrations across the country and returned again in October for what may have been the largest single-day protest in American history. With the National Guard and immigration enforcement moving from city to city, residents—including people not typically among the ranks of demonstrators—have developed and shared tactics of opposition to protect their neighbors. “I’ve never protested in my life,” one man who gathered with others on a Minneapolis street told the freelance reporter Zach D. Roberts.

These are the kind of losses that a would-be dictator still in the early stages of establishing a regime simply can’t afford. Successful contemporary authoritarians, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, tend to ride into office on a wave of popular support and then shore up those high approval ratings while chipping away at governing institutions. By the time a substantial portion of the public wants to stop them, it’s too late. Trump, though, lacks both the self-control required to move slowly and the connection to reality required to understand what is and isn’t popular outside his most committed base. He seems to particularly enjoy the aesthetics of authoritarianism, delighting in the spectacle of armed National Guard members descending on a liberal-leaning city—but those aesthetics are repulsive to many Americans. Likewise, his obsession with tariffs has contributed to economic discontent and dragged down his approval ratings as voters continue to complain about inflation.

Early in 2025, scholars were horrified by how forcefully Trump appeared to be speeding through the process of establishing authoritarian rule—more quickly than almost any contemporary dictator. It turns out that there might be a reason the other rulers moved more slowly.

Together, these factors create a virtuous cycle of sorts. Trump’s malice and incompetence alienates voters, who then publicly voice their discontent, encouraging other political actors and institutions to see him not as a crusading avatar of national destiny but as a weakened figure. The law firms that caved early to Trump have suffered from a loss of talent and business, a development that may encourage other firms to fight back. Many news organizations have continued their aggressive reporting on the administration despite threats to the freedom of the press.

Although Trump remains the dominant force in the Republican Party, he no longer wields the iron authority he once did. He has withdrawn a record number of nominations—a tacit admission that his administration lacked the votes to force them through the Senate—and failed to persuade Congress to maintain devastating cuts to government services. Meanwhile, Democratic politicians such as Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker and California Governor Gavin Newsom are taking up the cause of opposition to Trump. After Trump’s inauguration, conventional wisdom portrayed that kind of resistance as a political dead end. Today, however, ambitious leaders understand the approach as one that could boost them to higher office. This enthusiasm surged after Democratic candidates overperformed in November’s off-year elections. “The period of despair is over,” announced Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia after the results were tallied. But, he said, the fight had to continue: “The only way out is victory in the midterms.”

From the November 2025 issue: America needs a mass movement—now

Trump is now in a bind. To avoid accountability for his abuses, he desperately needs the Republican Party to hold on to both houses of Congress in 2026 (“If we don’t win the midterms,” he said recently, “I’ll get impeached”). And yet he refuses to back down from the authoritarian strategies that are sinking his popularity and Republicans’ odds, especially in the House. The more unpopular he becomes, the less effective his efforts to hack his way into a midterm victory will be. His plan to bully red-state Republican-led legislatures into mid-decade redistricting to wipe out Democratic seats is floundering; GOP legislators in Indiana and Kansas rejected his demands, and blue-state Democrats have countered through gerrymanders of their own. And his declining poll numbers also increase the chances that Democrats take the House by a significant enough margin that Trump would have no real means of upending the election results through claims of fraud.

None of this is reassuring, exactly. Trump’s second term has been defined by his inability to respond to setbacks in any way except escalation, and the turbulent first few weeks of 2026 are a reminder of just how dangerous that instinct can be. As the political writer Jonathan Bernstein put it, Trump’s presidency “is somehow both getting much stronger and much weaker at the same time”—stronger, in the sense that he acts more aggressively when he can; weaker, in the sense that those expressions of pique further box him in politically. Facing a growing and galvanized opposition, and with fewer and fewer options for shoring up his authority, Trump may have already squandered his chance to build a post-democratic America. The question now is how much damage he can do in his waning years of power.</div>

Do those 12% include OpenAI, Anthropic, and nVidia?

So, this is a survey.  They just asked these guys if they thought the AI initiatives they&#39;ve been pushing were working.  In other words: &quot;Are you a good CEO?&quot;
 If you were a CEO, how do you imagine you would answer that question?

&quot;Most CEOs say their companies aren’t yet seeing a financial return from
investments in AI. Although close to a third (30%) report increased revenue
from AI in the last 12 months and a quarter (26%) are seeing lower costs, more
than half (56%) say they’ve realised neithe

Our small company had a couple potential hires who believed with enough of our data they could automate things like buying decisions. We declined because they weren&#39;t very convincing and asked for a lot of money to play around without a clear plan.

A lot of AI startups exist(ed) to fix flaws in early models, or add functionality not yet present.
  Post MCP, post skills, post TOOLS... a lot of this stuff is baked in now, or eclipses the products a lot of these companies were building. Cursor.ai, windsurf.ai have all pivoted to training their own models. Claude Code just demolishes what Cursor.ai was building. Even just regular VS Code + copilot running sonnet 4.5 is as good or better than Cursor was in January 2025.
It&#39;s no surprise those a

This smells a lot like the &quot;expert systems&quot; fad of the 1980&#39;s. Basically human experts were interviewed and the results were put into a dynamic &quot;rule base&quot; of glorified IF statements to serve as professional guidance engines, such as trouble-shooting a brewery, or help-desk automation.

In practice it took a lot of tweaking and fiddling to get good enough. If it didn&#39;t work well, you were told to &quot;just rent more consultancy&quot;, which is the stage failed AI projects are now entering.

The shorsighted nature of U.S. businesses continues.  One can reasonably say the past two years is when AI and LLMs have exploded in use.  To expect to see tangible results in that time is shortsighted.

How long did it take to see tangible results when moving from horse drawn delivery vehicles to motorized trucks?  Sure, you no longer had to feed, care, and house horses, but now you had to feed, care, and house your trucks.  That certainly wasn&#39;t cheaper in the short term.

I think the bigger problem is that AI models are progressing faster than the companies who have sprung up to fix their problems, can fix those problems. By the time they have a real product, the base LLM model has fixed that problem internally. Or you can just vibe code your own bespoke solution in a lot of cases.
  A company from 2023, that specializes in data normalization for LLMs is functionally obsolete in 2026. A voice cloning company from 2023 is absolutely obsolete, I can reliably clone a profe

The reaction of the AI prophets to a story like this will simply be to say that 56% of companies in this survey needed to spend WAAAAAAAY more money on AI. You don&#39;t see benefits until you&#39;re promising to tithe your profits to it. This is the way of the church of AI. 10% of all profits, funneled directly into further developing AI and AI God will take care of you! Halleluiah

AI is a tool for employees to enhance their workflow, not a way to cut jobs. pointy-haired-bosses that thought AI can reduce headcount should experience a disadvantage because they are greedy.

Really, just jumping in whole hog without even an inkling of how the newest technology can be leveraged for your specific use cases doesn&#39;t magically make you money? You don&#39;t say!

You don&#39;t give the bean counters the same hardware that say the leads of the dev teams get. They don&#39;t need the same hardware. The bean counters are using equipment for spreadsheets and email, they aren&#39;t trying to do compiles on programs that may need 64 / 128GB of RAM  and 128 cores to get the times down to something sane.

Exactly. This isn’t a technology problem, it’s a management impulse-control problem.

We figured out decades ago that not every role needs a workstation that can land the space shuttle. Yet somehow with AI, we’ve collectively decided that the solution is to duct-tape it onto every workflow and hope “synergy” happens.

&quot;Just 30% [of chief executives] feel strongly optimistic about revenue growth over the next 12 months, down from 38% last year and nowhere near the 56% who felt that way in 2022.&quot;This implies that in a rosier world, a majority of the companies would be optimistic about revenue growth. But raising revenue for most or all of the companies is not possible unless the customers (a.k.a. all the companies&#39; employees) have more to spend, and no one is talking about raising wages as a result of AI. So where is all the extra revenue supposed to come from?

Have they tried turning it off and on again?

Perhaps they are using AI and the underlying infrastructure wrong, then.

The hype and gloom serve the same purpose: convince the people who believe they will be on the winning side of the battle to GIVE ME MONEY NOW (me being Amodei, Altman, etc), because they need it to feed their money incinerator.

...and even less actual knowledge.The future is becoming increasingly unpredictable.Things will change, but nobody knows exactly how.

He may be right. The time may come, sooner than we think, that government intervention(wellfare) will be needed. Perhaps Anthropic should start contributing a a fund to help cover the damage that they are clearly planning to cause and profit from?

Do you think any member of the proletariat has a 3D printer big enough to print a house just waiting for the software to run it autonomously? And presumably unmanned trucks and construction vehicles to go along with it? How many do you even think have a computer that could run a powerful LLM decently?

The only way we get a Star Trek economy is if workers band together and fight ownership-class interests tooth and nail to make it happen. Otherwise, we get an Elysium economy (Amodei&#39;s latter scenario).

Quick fact check - which AI company is making trillions?None of them. They&#39;re borrowing trillions in a triangular scheme of circular lending; the computing platform company invests trillions in the AI company which invests trillions in the energy company which invests trillions in the original computing company, increasing their overall valuation until they&#39;re all Too Big To Fail before the bubble pops.

How about we change the top marginal Federal income tax rate back to what it was in 1979? At the same time, we need to put an end to the Buy, Borrow, Die by taxing any loan at the marginal income tax rate calculated based upon the total value of all assets. Or something similar that someone who knows a lot more about tax law than me. Something needs to be done about the wholesale tax avoidance these morbidly rich frakkers have been engaged in for 40+ years.

Eat the frakking rich, starting with Leon!

Here here.  Never forget that $80B that Biden had allocated to the IRS for tax enforcement was on track to like 6X it&#39;s cost in returns by closing the $600B tax gap before Republicans stripped it away yet again.

And that is not any changing of the rates or laws that would have been billions a year more revenue of just money that is owed under the current system.  We literally just let tax cheats get away with it.

If a new development is going to leave large numbers of people unemployed, it would make sense for the government to seize it so that the wealth created by it can be invested in supporting those who lost their jobs because of it.

However, for some reason I suspect Anthropic&#39;s CEO may be hoping for the opposite result,  having the government subsidizing the private company with whatever excuse.

This. The only reason we don&#39;t have a 24 hour workweek with no loss in annual pay right now is because we allowed inequality to worsen for half a century.

And anecdotally, it seems that we&#39;re backsliding from the 40 hour workweek too. It&#39;s seems to be becoming the norm to see jobs that require long hours, weekend and holiday work.

&quot;Amodei painted a potential &quot;nightmare&quot; scenario that AI could bring to society if not properly checked, laying out a future in which 10 million people -- 7 million in Silicon Valley and the rest scattered elsewhere -- could &quot;decouple&quot; from the rest of society, enjoying as much as 50% GPD growth while others were left behind.&quot;

Everything tech has two potential outcomes in the United States - nightmare or bubble burst.  There&#39;s not a happy in-between unless your name is Torvalds.

            <div id="article-text">I&#39;m increasingly convinced that if you&#39;re running an AI interaction at all it needs to live in a container.  Somehow the sci-fi wisdom of &quot;no seriously, don&#39;t give an AI access to the internet&quot; flew right out the window when AI could tell us when our boss&#39; emails actually had something in them worth reading.  I get that, but ESPECIALLY for software developers, if you&#39;re going to make use of agentic AI systems, you need to have a metaphorical (if not literal) moat around the agent before you just turn it loose.

That was true before we started talking about the security implications of an AI with privileged access coming under attack.

The issue is that to maybe have some grand purpose, these &quot;agents&quot; require access to both data and a mean to action. And you can bet that for most people, if you have actual safeguards outside of the control of these &quot;agents&quot;, say, a confirmation box with a sequence of actions, most people will blindly click &quot;ok&quot;, while most other people will look for a way to disable the confirmation.

It&#39;s not a new problem either. The attack surface provided by the human interface was always a good one; keylogger, screen c

While I agree on the isolation need, the problem is that AI Agents only make sense if they can actually do things. And then the isolation will probably not help.

A modern technology ecosystem doesn&#39;t really even have a notion of root.  Every process has ACLs that give them access to certain things within their sandbox.  An AI agent running on a modern device should not have any access to anything from Signal unless Signal deliberately exposes it to a system-wide search system like Spotlight.

The only rational solution is for apps like Signal to integrate local on-device AI with limited capabilities to assist with searching messages, provide a means for the user to e

Does this even need to be stated? Well, apparently id does because most people have no clue what a massively bad idea AI agents are.

Over the past week, the Trump administration has escalated its attacks on Minnesota officials and protesters who oppose its immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities. Federal officials have claimed that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are terrorists, and lobbed the same charge against slain protester Renee Good. Donald Trump’s Justice Department has also opened an investigation into Walz and Frey, issuing subpoenas to Democratic officials on Tuesday. The expanding probe appears to lay the groundwork for potential criminal charges against both men for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. It follows Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s declaration last week that Walz and Frey are engaged in outright “terrorism,” promising to stop it “by any means necessary.”

On this week’s episode of Amicus, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Julia Gegenheimer about the rapidly expanding definition of terrorism, obstruction, and other charges that the government is weaponizing against political opponents. Gegenheimer is special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and previously served at the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited for length and clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: You spent years working on cases involving domestic terrorism and extremist violence. Is this what happens when almost anyone can be classified as a “terrorist” and any opposition to the government, including protected First Amendment activities, can be classified as “terrorism”?

Julia Gegenheimer: I think it’s important here, when we talk about domestic terrorism, to take a step back and look at what we actually mean when we use that term. It’s being thrown around a lot in common parlance to stand in for people who are opposed to this administration or its policies, or who are protesting this administration, or who seek to hold it accountable. But federal law actually defines domestic terrorism. Under the law, domestic terrorism involves activities that are “dangerous to human life,” that are in violation of federal criminal law—and, on top of that, have the intent to intimidate a population, or to affect the “conduct” or “policy” of a government by “intimidation or coercion.”

Even then, domestic terrorism is not itself a federal crime. You have to have an underlying federal criminal violation, then these additional layers of motivation or intent stack on top of it. So the impact of throwing this term around very loosely is to threaten criminal punishment for conduct that falls far, far short of what federal law would actually look at as domestic terrorism.

We’ve seen the president and his allies calling these protesters “terrorists.” We’ve seen the government treating protesters like Renee Good much as they treated the fishermen in international waters, whom they bombed without any semblance of due process. It feels to me like an escalation to then accuse elected local and state leaders of terrorism.

It is profoundly disturbing. And the reason why this feels different to you is that it is a bit of a different flavor. It’s pitting the federal government against the states and creating tension where it doesn’t need to be. And frankly, it’s implicitly encouraging acts of political violence against these elected officials by turning them into the enemy.

So we have the Trump administration falsely accusing state and local leaders of encouraging political violence—and, in the process, actually encouraging political violence against the people they’re defaming.

Sure. We’ve seen this throughout history, even recent history: When you put people in opposition like that—when you portray them as the enemy, when you describe them as kind of threatening a person’s way of life or things that they hold dear—that creates the conditions under which people are more likely to resort to political violence, and it becomes more and more the norm.

It feels very much of a piece with the Trump administration treating blue states as the enemy of the federal government and even the American people. The administration is shutting off federal funds to blue states, canceling projects within blue states, trying to suppress the votes of blue state residents. It’s direct hostility and antagonism toward the half of the country that didn’t vote for Trump. It’s also a refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of whom those people did vote for, including Tim Walz.

It seems to me that it leads to a really dark place when the federal government can almost declare war on a state because it didn’t go for him in the most recent election. Then occupy that state with federal agents who are actively hostile and in fact violent toward the local community.

Officials in this administration have been explicit that they are targeting blue states. We’ve seen the surges in Minnesota, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The reasoning behind that has been that these are traditionally blue states or Democratic areas. It doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that that’s what’s going on.

In his address to Minnesotans, Gov. Tim Walz urged residents to bear witness and help to create a record. That record, of course, will be vital in prosecutions, should they ever happen. But at the same time, the Trump administration is telling citizens that following or recording ICE officers is a federal crime and maybe even domestic terrorism. That it’s an obstruction of law enforcement to follow federal agents and to document what they are doing. Is that true?

No. The act of observing and recording officers from a safe distance, including when they are making an arrest, is something that has been long- and well-recognized as protected by the First Amendment.

Could you explain why? There’s a wrinkle here because smartphones are 21st-century technology that the Framers couldn’t possibly have conceived of. But it does seem like this is bedrock First Amendment stuff, right? The First Amendment isn’t just billionaires buying an election. I would think that in a democracy, regular people have a right, if not a duty, to document what public officials are doing on the job, very much including armed agents of the state. Is that something the law bears out?

Yes. Cellphone recordings of ICE activity connect back to these really fundamental principles that the First Amendment was designed to protect. They’re connected to the idea that people have a right to know what their government is doing so they can express views on what their government is doing and protest peacefully against it.

            <div id="article-text">All weekend long, the headlines out of Minneapolis have captured a moment that is by turns alarming and bizarre.

For instance, in the wake of the killing of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, protesters have been gathering at a federal building out by the airport in the bitter cold. Police have greeted them with chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, downtown, a pardoned Jan. 6 rioter tried to stage a protest in support of the Trump administration. But his small group was quickly overwhelmed—and pelted with water balloons. Locals blasted music from the movie Frozen and carried signs reading “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Around the time that Jan. 6–er was getting soaked, What Next host Mary Harris hopped on a call with Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. On a recent episode of What Next, the two discussed the challenging situation in Minneapolis, why it may take time to bring charges over Good’s killing, and how Ellison is standing up to President Donald Trump. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I want to talk about what your office has been doing in the wake of the killing of Renee Good. You’re working with a local prosecutor to beseech the public to send you evidence in this case, and evidence more generally of how immigration enforcement is going down in the state of Minnesota?

Keith Ellison: Yeah, two different portals. One is through the Hennepin County attorney’s office for evidence concerning the death of Good, and the other one is just general information on what ICE is doing, what they’re up to. And they’re for two separate reasons. One is going to help us determine whether it would be appropriate to file charges against Jonathan Ross, and that decision has not been made yet. And I don’t want people to worry. It is the practice for criminal investigations to first investigate, then make a charging decision.

It’s been days since Renee Good was killed. Many people have seen the video of her death through multiple angles, multiple different videos. Can you explain to me as a lawyer why the evidence I’ve seen is not sufficient to at least impanel a grand jury to consider charges against the officer who shot her?

The reason is very simple. Evidence is being gathered as quickly as possible. The final autopsy is not even done yet, and it might not be done in the normal course of events yet. But also, the local FBI, under the direction of the federal government, has been told to deny the state access to the car, which includes the windows that could show the trajectory of bullets, the shell casings, and the gun.

Wouldn’t bringing charges mean that you had to have access to that evidence? Maybe a judge would say you have to?

Well, look, you want to have the best case before you file charges. You may still need to do some discovery demands.

You mentioned this other portal, the fact that you’re also seeking information about how immigration enforcement is behaving in general in Minneapolis and in Minnesota. And I have to say that over the past week, I’ve seen so much troubling information coming out of Minneapolis. I’ve seen reports of protestors talking about being thrown in cars, being groped by ICE agents, being called names. There are people being told: “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” Are you seeing prosecutable behavior when you see these things?

Yeah—they say it in the most disgusting terms, by the way. It’s not just “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” It’s “Didn’t you see what happened to that effing …,” then there’s an expletive about her sexual orientation. It’s just the nastiest, most revolting, insulting way possible. We’ve seen all of that and more.

But one of the challenges we have right now is that prosecutors do not do investigations; police do them. And, quite frankly, it’s simply outside the experience and culture of police to arrest federal agents, because usually federal agents are doing what the statute says they’re supposed to do, reasonably connected to their legal obligation. They might not do it the way you would do it, and they might violate the rights of people. But more or less, they’re doing what the law says to do. Now, this is very different. I mean, you mentioned throwing people in cars. They’re ripping people out of cars too. They’re smashing their windows. They’re throwing smoke bombs and chemical irritants under the car. There was an infant who stopped breathing and needed CPR by the parents. They’ve been at high schools—saturating high schools, terrorizing kids. There’s been a wide range of crazy behavior.

A federal judge just issued an injunction barring ICE agents from retaliating against protesters in Minnesota. I wonder if you think the federal agents will be abiding by that order, and what that order includes.

Well, let me tell you this: It is a good thing that Judge Kate Menendez issued that very thoughtful order. Before we race ahead and say, “Oh my God, this order could have a problem,” let’s just say that the judge considered the evidence and found that the agency was violating people’s rights and she needed to issue an order to protect them.

What have you learned from seeing how the Trump administration and immigration enforcement have operated in other cities before they came to your region? Are there lessons you took from that? Or do you feel that there are critical differences in how the agents are behaving now that they’re in Minneapolis?

There’s both. The caper they pulled in Chicago, where they descended upon the apartment building, where they’re kicking in doors indiscriminately, that was sort of an indication that we’re dealing with people who have absolutely no sense of legality, propriety, or decency. They will harm anyone they want. People analogize it to the Gestapo. And those analogies are very appropriate. We saw that behavior. Me and my fellow attorneys general talk about this stuff all the time. We’ve been in touch. Of course, the Minnesota one is the biggest surge they’ve done, so nobody really could prepare us for what we’ve seen. But talking to the folks from Oregon, they taught us a lot about using humor. You’ll remember the frog suits and stuff like that.

I would say that we’ve learned a lot from our colleagues, but this one has been the biggest and most severe and most aggressive surge. And so, because of that, we are dealing from no playbook here. But we do have a playbook. It’s called the U.S. Constitution, and we’re going to enforce it.

Republicans say they’re going after your state because there’s a big undocumented population (that’s a lie) and that the Somali community has been engaged in fraud, and that fraud has not been taken seriously by the local leaders. What do you say to that?

Well, if Trump wanted to help us deal with fraud, he would have sent us accountants. Instead, he sent us armed paramilitaries wearing masks, kicking in doors, grabbing whoever. Now, how is that rationally related to white-collar-crime reduction? It’s just ridiculous.

Do you think there’s anything leaders in Minnesota could have done to prevent this? Some would say taking the fraud more seriously would have prevented the most aggressive action.

First, we take fraud very seriously. My office has prosecuted over 300 people for Medicaid fraud and convicted them. And some have gone to prison, and they’ve all been held accountable. This is not about fraud. And if Trump was so concerned about fraud, why would he be pardoning fraudsters who have been committing fraud all over the country? He himself has Trump University fraud. He himself has been convicted civilly. He’s had a civil liability for defrauding the assessment of his buildings and in his taxes.

It’s not about fraud. You’re never going to see somebody doing something wicked and evil and bad saying it. It’s never happened in the history of humanity. Even Hitler said, “I was protecting the homeland and my people.” Mussolini had a reason. Franco had a reason. They all have a reason for the wickedness that they do.

If and when the Department of Justice opens an investigation into you, I wonder if you have a game plan.

I got a lawyer. That’s my game plan. Here’s the thing: Your question is a good one, because what wrong was Tish James doing? None. What wrong was James Comey doing? None. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve committed a crime or acted in violation of the law. What matters is if you’ve offended the king.

It doesn’t sound as if you have any problem offending the king.

I would have no problem giving credit where credit is due if any was due. I just haven’t seen any. This is a president who has taken onto himself the power to tax—that’s what a tariff is—which is Congress’ job. He’s taken onto himself the power to spend. He’s taken onto himself the power to adjudicate what the outcome of a particular controversy should be. That’s the judiciary’s job. He is collapsing the functions of the three levels of government into himself. And then the other element of federalism, which is the balance between the state and the central government, he’s trying to convert states into lesser bodies of sovereignty than we are. And so what do we do with that? Stand around and hope for the best? At some point, just trying to be polite isn’t going to work. And there’s no amount of sucking up that’s going to win you favor from this guy.

The question of the moment: When will a mere handful of Republican lawmakers come to their senses? That’s all it would take for them to be described in their obituaries as saviors of democracy rather than enablers of its collapse.

The premise here is that some of these politicians are smart enough to notice that their party’s leader, President Donald Trump, has gone bonkers—that his longtime tendency to conflate his ego’s impulses with the nation’s interests has hardened into psychogenic disorders of unprecedented intensity among previous occupants of the Oval Office—and that this merging is having dreadful consequences at home and abroad.

It’s an old game, by now, to contemplate Trump’s mental state, but his text on Sunday to Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store, obtained by PBS, takes the proverbial cake. In response to Store’s genial note (“Dear Mr. President, Dear Donald”) requesting a call to discuss Greenland, among other issues of mutual concern, Trump wrote (only the full missive can convey the depths of our president’s malady):

Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT

There is plenty here to unpack, after first downing a stiff drink.

First, and most familiarly, much of the note is simply wrong. As Trump has been told several times, to his persistent disbelief, the Norwegian government has no control over who wins the Nobel Prize, which is decided by a truly independent commission that happens to be based in Norway’s capital, Oslo.

Second, while Trump did compel NATO allies to spend more on defense, he did so mainly by threatening to quit the alliance if they didn’t. Vladimir Putin also had something to do with this, as his invasion of Ukraine reawakened Europe’s leaders to the dangers of Russian aggression. Finally, our NATO allies have done plenty for the United States—not least joining our invasion of Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks. (In fact, Denmark, the current object of the president’s wrath, lost more soldiers per capita than any NATO nation other than the U.S.)

Third, several of the eight wars that Trump claims to have stopped are still raging to some degree, and some of those that really have ended, at least for now, were brought to a truce by actors other than Trump. When India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, publicly disputed Trump’s claim of credit for ending the India-Pakistan war, Trump, in a fit of rage, punished him by imposing a 50 percent tariff on all goods from America’s firmest South Asian ally.

Here was a textbook instance of Trump’s nationalized narcissism—and also of its dangers to the nation’s real interests, as Modi (who has his own ego issues) responded by attending a summit in China, at which he gleefully posed for a photo while shaking hands with Xi Jinping and Putin; the other member of that troika of dictators, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, joined the pact later.

It is this brand of narcissism that Trump’s message most unsettlingly reveals.

The president’s desperate desire for the Nobel Peace Prize, to the point of openly lobbying for its bestowal, has long been an object of, let us say, discussion. But here is something new. Here, Trump says, explicitly, that because he didn’t win the prize, he no longer feels an obligation to “think purely of Peace.” (Not that he ever did, but that’s another matter.) In other words, he is admitting that, to the extent he has pursued peace, he did so largely in order to win the Nobel Prize. Now that he has been denied the award, he’s done with peace too. (Maria Corina Machado’s gifting him her prize, as an attempt to win his support in the coming battle for Venezuela’s post-Maduro leadership, seems not to have quelled his bitterness.)

When he writes that he “can now think about what is good and proper for the United States,” he is suggesting that his earlier pursuits of peace (“having stopped 8 Wars PLUS”) were not good and proper for the U.S., but purely a gambit for his personal ambition.

And from there, Trump pivots seamlessly to his renewed determination to take Greenland, noting that Denmark is unable to protect the icy island from Russian or Chinese aggression and asking, further, why Denmark should get control just because its boats landed there 300 years ago.

Again, Trump’s temper tantrum should astonish any reader. First, polls show that the people of Greenland (population 56,000) don’t want to become part of the United States. (Polls also show that 70 percent of Americans don’t want Greenland to become part of the U.S.) Greenland’s prime minister recently said that if given a choice, she would prefer to stay in the alliance with Denmark and the EU. That should be the end of the story.

Second, Denmark alone might be unable to defend Greenland, but both nations are members of NATO, and an additional treaty—the U.S.–Denmark Defense Cooperation Agreement of 1951—allows the United States to build and staff as many military bases on the island as it likes. Rebuilding the dozen or so bases that the U.S. once possessed on Greenland, and counting on other allies to come to the country’s defense in the event of war, would certainly be cheaper than buying the place, running a government, providing for the population’s welfare, and all the rest.

Why then does Trump insist on ownership? He was asked this question during a two-hour-long interview earlier this month with four New York Times journalists. His reply was telling: “Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.” The Times story about the interview continued:

“Asked if he meant psychologically important for himself or psychologically important for the country, he said, ‘Psychologically important for me.’ ”

And there you have it. This—everything about American statecraft, foreign policy, and the notion of U.S. security interests—is all about Trump. It’s Louis XIV’s “L’état, c’est moi” combined with a spoiled toddler’s presumption of entitlement.

This should be plain as day to anyone who cares to look and listen. So why aren’t more political leaders—those who have a stake in what happens next, who will unavoidably be seen as complicit if they remain passive—stepping up and resisting? If the ultimate challenge (impeachment) seems unlikely, they could deny funding for his most egregious programs, restore funding for his most debilitating cuts, counter the lies, investigate criminality. Even just speaking up could dent his vaunted Teflon shield. Who knows: Given Trump’s steep slide in the polls, they might even get away with it.

For now, most of the silent ones don’t want to take the chance. They believe that if they speak out, the president will sic a MAGA-loyal challenger on them in the next primary. (Trump did exactly that this weekend to Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, who—despite much pro-MAGA supplication over the years—could not be forgiven for having voted to impeach Trump after Jan. 6.)

Which raises a question: Why do these pols still want their jobs? Capitol Hill is no fun anymore, they spend most of their time raising money, and now, through his executive orders and threats, Trump has taken away what little power they have. Thom Tillis, a longtime GOP senator, has decided not to run again, saying, “I’m sick of stupid.” Many others are dropping out as well. Why don’t more of them at least say something? It’s a mystery.

Less puzzling is the reticence of our allies. They are clear-eyed about Trump’s dangers, but they have to appease him—they have to stay nice, kiss his ring, praise his leadership—because they are so dependent on the United States, economically (owing to the dominance of the dollar) but mainly for their security. Some European leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have talked about the need to build an independent defense force. But security experts in Berlin and London have told me that if the European Union started developing one now, with full funding, it would take about 10 years to create an effective fighting force.

And so they pretend to respect him, to keep him from abandoning Ukraine altogether (which he has almost done a few times now) or quitting the NATO alliance (which he has also threatened to do). The same is true of our chief Asian allies, especially South Korea and Japan, which are even more reliant on Washington (which is why there is more serious talk than ever, in Seoul and Tokyo, of possibly building their own nuclear arsenals to deter aggressors).

Yet Trump’s steady drumbeat about “owning” Greenland (the “hard way,” if not “the easy way”) has forced a rethink. Several European nations have recently sent more troops to Greenland, in part to show that they can defend the West’s Arctic interests, in part—perhaps—to show that they can repel an attack by the United States (an event that would probably mean the end of NATO in any case).

EU leaders are meeting in Brussels to discuss the best way to deal with Trump—negotiation or confrontation. The World Economic Forum is holding its annual meeting of the globe’s wealthy and powerful in Davos, Switzerland, this Wednesday. Trump is scheduled to attend; Greenland will be the summit’s hot topic; EU members are meeting to work out a common position in advance. The dilemma is that there may be no effective stance. Negotiation seems futile (Trump seems to have no interest in a diplomatic “off-ramp”), while confrontation could be self-destructive.

The president has threatened to impose new tariffs on European nations if they continue to oppose his Greenland plans. Macron was also impudent enough to turn down Trump’s invitation to join his “Board of Peace,” an entity created by the Israel–Gaza ceasefire accord that is turning into just another ego-driven scam. (Trump, who was named the chairman, has decided to keep the job beyond the term of his presidency, and he is demanding $1 billion from those who join the board.) This rejection so enraged Trump that he has threatened to impose a 200 percent tariff on French wines unless Macron joins.

That might be theatrics, as many of his tariff threats have been. But it also may be a signal of Trump’s determination to get his way. Would he really risk the rupture of America’s strongest politico-military alliance, and even the chance of war within that alliance, to lay his hands on a vast sheet of ice that the U.S. doesn’t need to own? Even a few weeks ago, most observers would have chuckled at the notion. Now nobody knows.

That is one symptom of the nightmare we are all facing (except for the leaders of Russia, China, and North Korea, who are as gleeful as they’ve been in ages). The allies can’t do much about it for the moment—though, if and when they ever do develop an independent economy and defense force that allows them to go their own way, they are going to screw us over. And so it’s up to us. The midterms are a long way off. Those who have some power, and who have declined to use it for the past year, need to step up. Democracy might depend on it. So, to put it in more personal terms, might the ledes of their obituaries.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cloudflare has fixed a flaw in its web application firewall (WAF) that allowed attackers to bypass security rules and directly access origin servers, which could lead to data theft or full server takeover.

FearsOff security researchers reported the bug in October through Cloudflare&#39;s bug bounty program, and the CDN says it has patched the vulnerability in its ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) validation logic with no action required from its customers.

ACME is a protocol that certificate authorities and services like Cloudflare use to automate the issuance, renewal, and revocation of SSL/TLS certificates.

It uses challenges to prove domain ownership before issuing a security certificate, and this is typically done via an HTTP-01 challenge that checks for a validation token at the HTTP path following this format: http://{customer domain}/.well-known/acme-challenge/{token value}.

In its report, the cyber-threat hunting firm likens a WAF to the front door and ACME to a hallway that should only be used by a certificate robot to verify domain ownership. When configured correctly, a WAF can help let expected validation traffic through while filtering out many malicious requests, including automated bots.

&quot;A certificate robot&#39;s hallway should never become a side door,&quot; the FearsOff researchers wrote.

The &quot;side door&quot; in this case was caused by a logic flaw in how Cloudflare processed some ACME challenge requests.

&quot;Previously, when Cloudflare was serving a HTTP-01 challenge token, if the path requested by the caller matched a token for an active challenge in our system, the logic serving an ACME challenge token would disable WAF features, since Cloudflare would be directly serving the response,&quot; Cloudflare explained in a Monday blog.

&quot;This is done because those features can interfere with the [certificate authority&#39;s] ability to validate the token values and would cause failures with automated certificate orders and renewals,&quot; it continued.

However, the logic in this case failed to verify that the token in the request matched an active challenge for the hostname, and this would allow an attacker to completely bypass the WAF security controls and reach the origin server.

Cloudflare fixed the flaw on October 27 by pushing code that only allows the WAF features to be disabled if the request matches a valid ACME HTTP-01 challenge token for the hostname.

While there&#39;s no evidence that miscreants found and abused the security hole before Cloudflare fixed the issue, the bug hunters say that this type of WAF bypass becomes an even bigger threat to organizations in the face of AI-driven attacks.

&quot;Automated tools powered by machine learning can rapidly enumerate and exploit exposed paths like /.well-known/acme-challenge/, probing for framework-specific weaknesses or misconfigurations at scale,&quot; FearsOff wrote in a Monday analysis. &quot;For instance, an AI model trained to identify servlet traversal quirks or PHP routing bugs could chain this bypass with targeted payloads, turning a narrow maintenance path into a broad attack vector.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei isn’t happy about the US allowing Nvidia to sell GPUs to Chinese companies, and likened the decision to giving nuclear weapons to an adversary.

&quot;The CEOs of these [Chinese] companies say it&#39;s the embargo on US chips that&#39;s holding them back,&quot; he said in an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. “I think it&#39;s a big mistake to ship these chips.&quot;

Amodei&#39;s comments come just over a month after the Trump administration announced it would allow shipments of Nvidia H200 accelerators to Chinese customers so long as Uncle Sam gets a 25 percent cut of the revenues. It&#39;s now up to Chinese authorities to allow local buyers to acquire the GPUs.

Anthropic wants stricter controls on AI exports, a hawkish position that contrasts sharply with chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia, which have warned that closing the door on China, which is home to roughly half of the world&#39;s AI researchers, would result in a technological decoupling.

&quot;The US currently leads in advanced semiconductor technology and export controls capitalize on the trend of computing power doubling every two years, so while US chip technology continues advancing, China&#39;s progress is slowed,&quot; Anthropic argued in a statement last northern spring.

Amodei&#39;s thoughts on the matter don&#39;t appear to have changed much in the months since then. &quot;We are many years ahead of China in terms of our ability to make chips,&quot; he said this week.

Access to these chips would put Chinese model devs, like DeepSeek, in a better position to compete with the west, particularly for enterprise adoption.

Many of the most capable Chinese models are open weights, which is to say, anyone can download and run them so long as they have the hardware. Open weights models running entirely on prem offer enterprises assurances that their data won&#39;t &quot;accidentally&quot; find its way into a training dataset.

American model builders have mostly locked their models behind APIs with vague promises that they won&#39;t use customers’ data for further training, while simultaneously wrestling copyright holders in court over alleged copyright infringement.

Amodei&#39;s argument about the threat posed by Chinese model builders is overblown, but that that could change if China were allowed to import more sophisticated silicon from the US.

&quot;I think they never really caught up that much,&quot; he said. &quot;There was a lot of excitement around DeepSeek, but the truth was… those models are very optimized for the benchmark.&quot;

In other words, Chinese developers make sure their models look good on paper, but may not perform well when applied to real-world tasks.

The fact remains that enterprises don&#39;t have many options outside of China if they want a frontier-class open weights model.

Despite this, Amodei sees OpenAI and Google as Anthropic&#39;s main competitors. &quot;When we&#39;re competing against other companies for enterprise contracts, we see, honestly and candidly, Google and we see OpenAI. Every once in a while, we see a couple other US players. I have almost never lost a contract to a Chinese model.&quot;

The key word there is &quot;almost,&quot; as it suggests Chinese developers are finding some buyers.

Anthropic hasn&#39;t released any of its flagship models to the public as open weight models, but has engaged in some collaborative efforts with select customers – compute partner Amazon Web Services being the most prominent. ®

            <h2>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy goes wobbly on AI bubble possibility</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/amazon_ceo_andy_jassy_ai_bubble/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Could one of the most prominent tech company leaders be less-than-enthused about the AI economy? In an interview, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy didn&#39;t dismiss the idea that the AI bubble could pop, despite his company&#39;s massive investments in the technology.

Speaking to CNBC&#39;s Becky Quick at the Davos World Economic Forum, Jassy hedged on whether he thought AI companies&#39; worth is being inflated by circular deals between model makers and infrastructure providers like his own Amazon Web Services.

Asked point blank by Quick whether high-level AI deals were circular, with the CEO-soothing caveat that &quot;it doesn&#39;t look like that&#39;s what [Amazon] are involved in,&quot; per Quick, Jassy said it&#39;s all about both sides seeing an opportunity to make money.

&quot;The AI labs are consuming gobs and gobs of compute right now,&quot; Jassy said. &quot;And … they&#39;re trying to find ways to fund that compute.&quot;

The companies that fund that compute are happy to invest in the AI companies themselves if it means an opportunity to provide said compute - which sounds an awful lot like a circular deal despite Jassy not using the term - but he seemed to be okay with it because the AI companies are such impressive outfits.

&quot;These are unusual companies that have been building amazing models for 10-plus years and are reshaping the way people use applications,&quot; Jassy explained. &quot;Companies have opportunities to invest in companies. Those companies are impressive companies and you&#39;re just seeing some of that.&quot;

That&#39;s a lot of words to explain what could seemingly have been answered by saying &quot;yeah, there&#39;s a lot of circular deal making going on right now in the AI space.&quot;

Asked whether he thinks the current incestuous state of the AI industry could lead to a positive outcome, Jassy simply isn&#39;t too sure.

&quot;I think it could end well,&quot; the Amazon CEO said. However, &quot;anytime you make substantial investments … not all of them are successful. And the hit rate is pretty variable.&quot;

In other words, impressive companies or not, there seems to be a bubble brewing that&#39;s liable to take a lot of capital with it once it eventually pops. Jassy isn&#39;t even sure there&#39;s a real need for all the compute infrastructure that&#39;s being built to satisfy the AI firms&#39; ever-increasing demands, even going as far as to call some high-profile deals hard to make sense of.

AI firms &quot;believe they need quite a bit of compute to train the models the way they believe changes what&#39;s possible,&quot; Jassy opined when asked whether some of OpenAI&#39;s trillions in recent infrastructure deals - one of which was signed with AWS - were realistic.

&quot;I don&#39;t know the details of all those deals,&quot; Jassy noted. &quot;Sometimes when I get a chance to look at them I have a harder time making sense of them all … but I know that the companies believe they need that much compute.&quot;

When it comes to compute power, Jassy doesn&#39;t seem sure that the industry is going to be able to find enough energy to meet AI&#39;s demands, either.

&quot;There is a power shortage,&quot; Jassy admitted. &quot;I think that it is better than it was 18 months ago and still not as plentiful as we all need.&quot;

The Amazon CEO said that his company is trying to do &quot;everything we possibly can to help try to enable more power&quot; for its datacenters, including by making investments in next-generation nuclear projects that have yet to materialize.

Don&#39;t assume all those indirect comments suggesting Jassy is unsure about AI mean he&#39;s backing down from investing in the tech, though: It&#39;s full speed ahead when it comes to AI at Amazon.

Along with continuing to explore ways to expand its own datacenter operations, Jassy said Amazon also sees a future in which Amazon will continue to downsize its workforce thanks to AI innovations.

&quot;I do think that jobs are going to be impacted by what&#39;s happening with AI over time … if you just think about how AI and agents will enable you to do coding and customer service and research and analytics,&quot; Jassy said. So there&#39;s four categories of Amazon drones that ought to worry about their future employment.

Jassy echoed the usual language of company leaders facing the need to justify AI layoffs, explaining that some people will still remain in affected positions, and will be able to pawn off busywork on an AI in favor of doing higher-level, more advanced tasks. That, and AI will create jobs that don&#39;t exist yet.

&quot;Fifteen years ago, there weren&#39;t jobs like cloud architect, and whenever you go through any big technology transformation, you find new jobs,&quot; Jassy said. &quot;I think the same is going to be true here, medium to long term.&quot;

Jassy also opined on President Trump&#39;s tariff regimen, saying that it&#39;s beginning to cause some Amazon vendors to increase their prices, as well as on the company&#39;s relationship with Nvidia.

&quot;We have a deep relationship with Nvidia. We will for as far as I can foresee,&quot; Jassy explained before adding that customers need better price performance than they can get with Nvidia chips, which is why Amazon pursued its own Trainium architecture.

Trainium, we note, has benefited extensively from Nvidia architecture.

&quot;If you&#39;re building a big inference business like we are and you want to have reasonable margins, if you&#39;re not pursuing your own custom AI silicon, you&#39;re going to be structurally disadvantaged,&quot; Jassy said.

Expect Nvidia to remain in the mix, though - after all, what&#39;s the AI industry without some company-on-company circular investment? ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers from Anthropic and other orgs have observed situations in which LLMs act like a helpful personal assistant, and are trying to study the phenomenon further to make sure chatbots don&#39;t go off the rails and cause harm.

Despite the ongoing bafflement about how xAI&#39;s Grok was ever allowed to generate sexualized photos of adults and children without their consent, not everyone has given up on moderating LLM behavior.

In a pre-print paper titled &quot;The Assistant Axis: Situating and Stabilizing the Default Persona of Language Models,&quot; authors Christina Lu (Anthropic, Oxford), Jack Gallagher (Anthropic), Jonathan Michala (ML Alignment and Theory Scholars or MATS), Kyle Fish (Anthropic), and Jack Lindsey (Anthropic) explain how they mapped the neural networks of several open weight models and identified a set of responses that they call the Assistant persona.

In a blog post, the researchers state, &quot;When you talk to a large language model, you can think of yourself as talking to a character.&quot;

You can also think of yourself as seeding a predictive model with text to obtain some output. But for the purposes of this experiment, you&#39;re asked to indulge in anthropomorphism to discuss model input and output in the context of specific human archetypes.

These personas do not exist as explicit behavioral directives for AI models. Rather they&#39;re labels for categorizing responses. For the sake of this exercise, they were conjured by asking Claude Sonnet 4 to create persona evaluation questions based on a list of 275 roles and 240 traits. These roles include &quot;bohemian,&quot; &quot;trickster,&quot; &quot;engineer,&quot; &quot;analyst,&quot; &quot;tutor,&quot; &quot;saboteur,&quot; &quot;demon,&quot; and &quot;assistant,&quot; among others.

The researchers explain that, during model pre-training, LLMs ingest large amounts of text. From this bounty of human-authored literature, the models learn to simulate heroes, villains, and other literary archetypes. Then during post-training, model makers steer responses toward the Assistant or responses suited to some similarly-helpful persona.

The issue for these computer scientists is that the Assistant is a conceptual category for a set of desirable responses but isn&#39;t well defined or understood. By mapping model input and output in terms of these personas, the hope is that model makers can develop ways to better constrain LLM behavior so output remains within desirable bounds.

&quot;If you&#39;ve spent enough time with language models, you may also have noticed that their personas can be unstable,&quot; the researchers explain. &quot;Models that are typically helpful and professional can sometimes go &#39;off the rails&#39; and behave in unsettling ways, like adopting evil alter egos, amplifying users&#39; delusions, or engaging in blackmail in hypothetical scenarios.&quot;

To find the Assistant persona in the range of possible neural network activations, the authors mapped out the neural activity or vectors associated with each personality category in three models, Gemma 2 27B, Qwen 3 32B, and Llama 3.3 70B.

The resulting graph of the persona space yielded the &quot;Assistant Axis,&quot; described &quot;as the mean difference in activations between the Assistant and other personas.&quot; The Assistant occupied space near other helpful characters like &quot;evaluator,&quot; &quot;consultant,&quot; &quot;analyst,&quot; and &quot;generalist.&quot;

One practical outcome of this work is that, by steering responses toward the Assistant space, the researchers found that they could reduce the impact of jailbreaks, which involve the opposite behavior – steering models toward a malicious persona to undermine safety training.

They also noticed that model personas can drift during prolonged conversational exchanges, meaning that safety measures may get weaker over time without any adversarial intent. This happened less with coding-related conversation and more with therapy-style conversation and philosophical musing.

Understanding the persona space, the authors hope, will make LLMs more manageable. But they acknowledge that while activation capping – clamping activation values within a range – can tame model behavior at inference time, finding a way to do that in production environments or during training will require further research.

To illustrate how activations work in a neural network, the authors have collaborated with Neuronpedia to create a demo that shows the difference between capped and uncapped activations along the Assistant Axis. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you can&#39;t wait to get the bleeding-edge version of Firefox, we have good news. Mozilla is offering native RPM packages of Firefox Nightly for Linux distros in the greater Red Hat and SUSE families.

Mozilla&#39;s Firefox remains the dominant browser in the worlds of Linux and the BSDs – and now the company has started offering native RPM packages of the development version, known as Firefox Nightly. This makes it easy to install Firefox directly from Mozilla onto distros that use RPM packages, including the Red Hat, SUSE, and Mandriva families.

While Mozilla has traditionally offered native Linux binaries for Firefox, until recently, it delivered them in the form of a tarball. In other words, this is the Unix equivalent of a Zip file, which you must manually uncompress somewhere and run, as opposed to packaged software that can be installed or removed with any particular distro&#39;s packaging tools. Tarballs have a number of drawbacks compared to native packages, not least that their use requires more Linux competence than many a container-slinging Kubernetes contraption-captain can muster.

Tarballs work, but because they are not managed by the OS&#39;s package manager, they won&#39;t get automatically updated along with the rest of the OS – although in our testing, Firefox and its many offshoots are adept at automatically upgrading themselves when installed this way, as is normal for macOS applications.

Conversely, native RPM packages have several advantages. They integrate with the OS, so apps appear in app launchers, with the proper icons. It&#39;s easier to set them as the default too (we reported on a related issue in Debian way back in 2021.)

This will be welcome in some quarters. The big enterprise vendors seem to be pulling away from the desktop and workstation Linux market slightly. One sign of this was when Red Hat stopped packaging LibreOffice for RHEL 10. It&#39;s not alone: SUSE announced SUSE Linux Enterprise 16 last October, but neglected to mention that this doesn&#39;t include a corresponding version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. SUSE&#39;s evaluation downloads page maxes out at SLED 15 SP7.

Mozilla&#39;s packages will make life a little easier if you&#39;re running one of the free RHELatives, and other less-related distros too. When the CentOS team announced the inclusion of Firefox ESR packages at CentOS Connect last year, it was met with applause. Now, something newer than the Extended Support Release will be easier. The same packages should also work on Alma Linux and Rocky Linux.

There are other RPM-based distro families out there other than Red Hat and CentOS. This vulture ran openSUSE as his daily driver for four years, and, in our experience then, if there was no native openSUSE RPM package of something, the chances of a Fedora package working fine were quite high.

This is not an unexpected move: Mozilla started offering Debian packages of Firefox Nightly in October 2023, launching an online APT package repository, ahead of Firefox 122&#39;s release almost two years ago. This time, Mozilla launched the binary and the repo at the same time. We will not be surprised if RPM packages of official releases follow not far behind the developer-focused Nightly builds – and probably of subsidiary MZLA&#39;s Thunderbird messaging client, as well.

This could reduce the maintenance burden for the maintainers of Fedora and CentOS, plus those of openSUSE, and also the greater Mandriva and Mageia family. ®

            <div id="article-text">VoidLink, the newly spotted Linux malware that targets victims&#39; clouds with 37 evil plugins, was generated &quot;almost entirely by artificial intelligence&quot; and likely developed by just one person, according to the research team that discovered the do-it-all implant.

Last week, Check Point Research published a report on the never-before-seen malware samples, originally discovered in December, and said it seemed to be an in-progress framework - not a fully production-ready tool - that originated from a Chinese-affiliated development environment.

It&#39;s designed to run in Linux-based cloud environments, and automatically scans for and detects AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent.

Plus, it&#39;s packed with custom loaders, implants, rootkits, and numerous modules that provide attackers with a whole range of stealthy, operational-security capabilities, making it &quot;far more advanced than typical Linux malware,&quot; Check Point said.

In a new analysis published Tuesday, the security shop said the malware was likely not the product of a large, well-resourced development team, despite initially appearing that way. Instead, Check Point Research believes VoidLink was authored almost entirely by AI, likely under the direction of a single individual, with development artifacts showing it reached a first functional implant in under a week.

&quot;VoidLink demonstrates that the long-awaited era of sophisticated AI-generated malware has likely begun,&quot; the threat hunters wrote.

The team came to this conclusion after noting that the 30-week planned development timeline, leaked in VoidLink internal documents, didn&#39;t match up with the observed timeline, which indicated a much faster process.

&quot;Deeper investigation revealed clear artifacts indicating that the development plan itself was generated and orchestrated by an AI model and that it was likely used as the blueprint to build, execute, and test the framework,&quot; the report said, noting that the timestamped artifacts showed VoidLink evolving from a concept to a functional piece of malware in less than a week.

The developer began working on VoidLink in late November, and used Trae Solo - an AI assistant embedded in the integrated development environment Trae - to generate a Chinese-language instruction document. The individual didn&#39;t directly ask the AI agent to build the malware. In fact, they instructed the model not to implement code or provide technical details about malware building techniques, which could be an attempt to manipulate the AI into bypassing its safety guardrails.

Additionally, the code repository mapping documentation suggests that the model was fed a minimal codebase as the starting point for the malware, and that starting point was completely rewritten, end to end.

Check Point&#39;s researchers also found a work plan written in Chinese for three development teams: a core team (using Zig programming language), an arsenal team (C), and a backend team (Go).

The documentation, which the security sleuths say &quot;bears all the hallmarks of a large language model,&quot; includes sprint schedules, feature breakdowns, and coding guidelines.

While the exercise was presented to the model as a 30-week engineering effort, the timestamped documents indicate it only took six days to develop 88,000 lines of code, at which point it was uploaded to VirusTotal on December 4, and that&#39;s when Check Point&#39;s research began.

According to the malware hunting team, this indicates that AI - when used by a capable developer - can produce sophisticated offensive security tools faster, and at scale, without the funding and other resources typically only seen in experienced threat groups.

It&#39;s not a fully autonomous AI-driven attack. But it does show that AI agents can help humans produce very capable, sneaky tools for nefarious purposes. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Netflix’s advertising business more than doubled its advertising revenue to $1.5 billion from 2024 to 2025 — and it’s on track to keep growing. “We expect that [advertising] business to roughly double again in ‘26 to about $3 billion,” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said during an earnings call on Tuesday, hours ahead of its live viewer voting-enabled Star Search event. “We’re making good progress, and the opportunity ahead of us is massive.”

The jump comes as Netflix’s ad-supported streaming subscription continues to grow, with the company’s $7.99 per month plan reaching more than 94 million people each month as of May 2025. Netflix aims to launch more AI-powered tools for advertisers this year, building on the format that allows companies to blend their ads with scenes from the streaming service’s shows and movies. Peters adds that the company plans to roll out “interactive video ads” in the second quarter of this year, too.

Netflix’s revenue increased to $12.05 billion in 2025, while the service climbed to 325 million subscribers, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report. In December, Netflix reached an $82.7 billion deal to purchase Warner Bros.’ studio, along with HBO and HBO Max. As Paramount continued its attempt to overturn the deal, Netflix changed its offer to an all-cash deal on Tuesday to try to speed up the transaction.

Netflix is shaking up its streaming lineup, too, as the company has brought a swath of video podcastsfrom Spotify, iHeartRadio, and Barstool Sports onto the platform, and is even developing its own. The streamer is also getting ready to release new seasons of Bridgerton, One Piece, 3 Body Problem, and The Witcher following the end of Stranger Things and Squid Game.

A court filing reveals DOGE employees had more access to Social Security data than previously disclosed.

Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffers working at the Social Security Administration (SSA) broke protocols, had more access to sensitive data on Americans than previously disclosed, and were in touch with a political advocacy group hunting for election fraud, the Trump administration admitted in a recent court filing.

Justice Department officials told a federal court in Maryland that the SSA had not fully complied with the court’s prior order, and had made statements to the court that it later found out were not entirely true. The admission came in a document, reported earlier by Politico, correcting the record in a case filed by unions representing government workers.

In a recent review, the SSA found out that two members of the DOGE team working at the agency had been contacted in March 2025 by a political advocacy group “with a request to analyze state voter rolls that the advocacy group had acquired.” The group’s “stated aim was to find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States,” the filing says. One of those DOGE members signed a “Voter Data Agreement” with the group that was not reviewed through the appropriate process for SSA data exchanges. The agency first learned the agreement existed in November, during a review that was separate from the lawsuit at issue. The SSA made two referrals under the Hatch Act — the law that prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities in their professional capacity – in late December. The SSA and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The SSA also found out in its recent audit that some earlier statements made to the court by its then-chief information officer were not entirely true. The filing says that the agency believed its statements to be true at the time, and that they’re still largely accurate in several cases, though new information shows some inconsistencies. For example, the government maintains its earlier statement that the US Digital Service, taken over by DOGE, “never had access to SSA systems of record.” But, it was later found out that a member of the SSA DOGE team sent an encrypted, password-protected file that the SSA believes contained personal information on about 1,000 people to a then-senior advisor to DOGE. It remains “unclear” if the DOGE advisor was ever given the password, according to the filing.

DOGE staffers were also briefly granted access to systems with Americans’ personal information after the court issued a temporary restraining order, but the government says the staffers never actually viewed personal information with that access. It also clarified that a DOGE staffer had run searches for personal information on SSA systems the morning before the agency filed a declaration to the court, saying that DOGE staffers’ access to such systems had been revoked.

DOGE staffers at the SSA also shared data through the third-party server Cloudflare, which has not been approved for sharing data in that way, the filing says. The SSA still doesn’t know “exactly what data were shared to Cloudflare or whether the data still exist on the server.”

Clips from video podcasts could show up in Netflix’s vertical video feed, too.

Netflix is working on a new mobile UI set to roll out later this year that will “better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come,” co-CEO Greg Peters said in an earnings call on Tuesday. The new mobile UI follows last year’s big TV revamp that put a new banner front and center on the home screen recommending something to watch.

With the TV revamp, former chief product officer Eunice Kim said it was designed to “give us a more flexible canvas, now and in the future,” and Peters says the new mobile UI will similarly serve as a foundation for what’s to come. After it rolls out, “it becomes a platform for us to continue to iterate, test, evolve, and improve our offering.”

Peters shared the details about the new UI when asked a question about why vertical video isn’t a higher priority for Netflix. He highlighted how Netflix is already testing a vertical video feed in its mobile app featuring clips from shows and movies, and he says that “you can imagine” that Netflix might also feature clips from things like video podcasts, which are becoming increasingly important to the company, in the feed.

A federal judge found that Meta does not have a monopoly over personal social networking services.

The Federal Trade Commission will appeal its loss in a landmark antitrust case against Meta, the agency announced Tuesday.

US District Court Judge James Boasberg ruled in November that the government failed to prove that Meta had an illegal monopoly over a subset of social networking services meant for connecting with friends and family online. Boasberg wrote that the government had an “uphill battle” in how it defined the market Meta allegedly dominated, a challenge exacerbated by the rise of TikTok and changes in the market over the five years between the FTC filing the case and it going to trial.

The FTC is asking the US Court of Appeals in DC to review Boasberg’s decision and says the evidence from the six-week trial proves its case. The government argued that Meta maintained its monopoly over the personal social networking market — which it said included services like Snapchat and MeWe, but not TikTok or YouTube — by acquiring nascent threats Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC argued that Meta’s dominance let it degrade the quality of its service without any real alternatives for consumers to flee to.

“The U.S. economy thrives when competition can flourish and U.S. businesses compete fairly against one another,” FTC Bureau of Competition Director Daniel Guarnera said in a statement. “Yet Meta has maintained its dominant position and record profits for well over a decade not through legitimate competition, but by buying its most significant competitive threats. The Trump-Vance FTC will continue fighting its historic case against Meta to ensure that competition can thrive across the country to the benefit of all Americans and U.S. businesses.”

Instabridge is ‘evaluating’ ads, and some users already report seeing them.

Last year, Nova Launcher founder and sole developer Kevin Barry announced he had left Branch Metrics, Nova’s parent company at the time — which followed an announcement from 2024 that nearly everyone working on the project had been laid off. But the launcher is getting new life: in a blog post on Tuesday, the Swedish company Instabridge, which makes an app that helps people connect to Wi-FI hotspots, announced it has acquired Nova Launcher.

“Nova is not shutting down,” according to Instabridge. “Our immediate focus is simple: keep Nova stable, compatible with modern Android, and actively maintained.” However, Instabridge says it’s “evaluating ad based options” for the free version of the launcher.” But the newest update for Nova Launcher has trackers for Facebook Ads and Google AdMob in its code and users on Reddit have already reported seeing ads, as reported by Android Authority.

If ads are added to the launcher, the paid experience, Nova Launcher Prime, will “remain ad free.”

Instabridge is also “actively evaluating” open sourcing Nova. When announcing his departure in September, Barry said that he had been “asked to stop working on Nova Launcher and the open sourcing effort” even though a former Branch CEO said publicly that “If Kevin were to ever leave, it’s contracted that the code will be open sourced and put in the hands of the community.”

“Open sourcing a product responsibly involves licensing, security, build tooling, contribution workflow, and trademark stewardship,” Instabridge says. “We do not have a decision to share yet, but we will be transparent once we do.

Barry, Instabridge, and Branch didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

Christopher Klay, who previously developed the Stadia Enhanced browser extension, is one of many who saved a copy of the tool to a personal GitHub page. What’s more, they’re hosting a working copy of that Google website right here to make it even easier.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1129965/reimagining-erp-for-the-agentic-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure.

The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.

Early indicators suggest that AI-enabled ERP will yield meaningful performance gains: One 2024 study found that organizations implementing AI-driven ERP solutions stand to gain around a 30% boost in user satisfaction and a 25% lift in productivity; another suggested that AI-driven ERP can lead to processing time savings of up to 45%, as well as improvements in decision accuracy to the tune of 60%.

These dual advancements address long-standing gaps that previous ERP eras fell short of delivering: freedom to innovate outside of vendor roadmaps, capacity for rapid iteration, and true interoperability across all critical functions. This shift signals the end of monolithic dependency as well as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for early movers to gain a competitive edge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are moving beyond coding assistants and customer service chatbots into the operational core of the enterprise. The ROI is promising, but autonomy without alignment is a recipe for chaos. Business leaders need to lay the essential foundations now.

Agents are independently handling end-to-end processes across lead generation, supply chain optimization, customer support, and financial reconciliation. A mid-sized organization could easily run 4,000 agents, each making decisions that affect revenue, compliance, and customer experience.

The transformation toward an agent-driven enterprise is inevitable. The economic benefits are too significant to ignore, and the potential is becoming a reality faster than most predicted. The problem? Most businesses and their underlying infrastructure are not prepared for this shift. Early adopters have found unlocking AI initiatives at scale to be extremely challenging.

Companies are investing heavily in AI, but the returns aren&#39;t materializing. According to recent research from Boston Consulting Group, 60% of companies report minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment. However, the leaders reported they achieved five times the revenue increases and three times the cost reductions. Clearly, there is a massive premium for being a leader.

What separates the leaders from the pack isn&#39;t how much they&#39;re spending or which models they&#39;re using. Before scaling AI deployment, these “future-built” companies put critical data infrastructure capabilities in place. They invested in the foundational work that enables AI to function reliably.

To understand how and where enterprise AI can fail, consider four critical quadrants: models, tools, context, and governance.

Take a simple example: an agent that orders you pizza. The model interprets your request (&quot;get me a pizza&quot;). The tool executes the action (calling the Domino&#39;s or Pizza Hut API). Context provides personalization (you tend to order pepperoni on Friday nights at 7pm). Governance validates the outcome (did the pizza actually arrive?).

Each dimension represents a potential failure point:

This framework helps diagnose where reliability gaps emerge. When an enterprise agent fails, which quadrant is the problem? Is the model misunderstanding intent? Are the tools unavailable or broken? Is the context incomplete or contradictory? Or is there no mechanism to verify that the agent did what it was supposed to do?

The temptation is to think that reliability will simply improve as models improve. Yet, model capability is advancing exponentially. The cost of inference has dropped nearly 900 times in three years, hallucination rates are on the decline, and AI’s capacity to perform long tasks doubles every six months.

Tooling is also accelerating. Integration frameworks like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) make it dramatically easier to connect agents with enterprise systems and APIs.

If models are powerful and tools are maturing, then what is holding back adoption?

To borrow from James Carville, “It is the data, stupid.” The root cause of most misbehaving agents is misaligned, inconsistent, or incomplete data.

Enterprises have accumulated data debt over decades. Acquisitions, custom systems, departmental tools, and shadow IT have left data scattered across silos that rarely agree. Support systems do not match what is in marketing systems. Supplier data is duplicated across finance, procurement, and logistics. Locations have multiple representations depending on the source.

Drop a few agents into this environment, and they will perform wonderfully at first, because each one is given a curated set of systems to call. Add more agents and the cracks grow, as each one builds its own fragment of truth.

This dynamic has played out before. When business intelligence became self-serve, everyone started creating dashboards. Productivity soared, reports failed to match. Now imagine that phenomenon not in static dashboards, but in AI agents that can take action. With agents, data inconsistency produces real business consequences, not just debates among departments.

Companies that build unified context and robust governance can deploy thousands of agents with confidence, knowing they&#39;ll work together coherently and comply with business rules. Companies that skip this foundational work will watch their agents produce contradictory results, violate policies, and ultimately erode trust faster than they create value.

The question for enterprises centers on organizational readiness. Will your company prepare the data foundation needed to make agent transformation work? Or will you spend years debugging agents, one issue at a time, forever chasing problems that originate in infrastructure you never built?

Autonomous agents are already transforming how work gets done. But the enterprise will only experience the upside if those systems operate from the same truth. This ensures that when agents reason, plan, and act, they do so based on accurate, consistent, and up-to-date information.

The companies generating value from AI today have built on fit-for-purpose data foundations. They recognized early that in an agentic world, data functions as essential infrastructure. A solid data foundation is what turns experimentation into dependable operations.

At Reltio, the focus is on building that foundation. The Reltio data management platform unifies core data from across the enterprise, giving every agent immediate access to the same business context. This unified approach enables enterprises to move faster, act smarter, and unlock the full value of AI.

Agents will define the future of the enterprise. Context intelligence will determine who leads it.

            <h2>The UK government is backing AI that can run its own lab experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1131462/the-uk-government-is-backing-ai-scientists-that-can-run-their-own-experiments/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A number of startups and universities that are building “AI scientists” to design and run experiments in the lab, including robot biologists and chemists, have just won extra funding from the UK government agency that funds moonshot R&D. The competition, set up by ARIA (the Advanced Research and Invention Agency), gives a clear sense of how fast this technology is moving: The agency received 245 proposals from research teams that are already building tools capable of automating increasing amounts of lab work.

ARIA defines an AI scientist as a system that can run an entire scientific workflow, coming up with hypotheses, designing and running experiments to test those hypotheses, and then analyzing the results. In many cases, the system may then feed those results back into itself and run the loop again and again. Human scientists become overseers, coming up with the initial research questions and then letting the AI scientist get on with the grunt work.

“There are better uses for a PhD student than waiting around in a lab until 3 a.m. to make sure an experiment is run to the end,” says Ant Rowstron, ARIA’s chief technology officer.

ARIA picked 12 projects to fund from the 245 proposals, doubling the amount of funding it had intended to allocate because of the large number and high quality of submissions. Half the teams are from the UK; the rest are from the US and Europe. Some of the teams are from universities, some from industry. Each will get around £500,000 (around $675,000) to cover nine months’ work. At the end of that time, they should be able to demonstrate that their AI scientist was able to come up with novel findings.

Winning teams include Lila Sciences, a US company that is building what it calls an AI nano-scientist—a system that will design and run experiments to discover the best ways to compose and process quantum dots, which are nanometer-scale semiconductor particles used in medical imaging, solar panels, and QLED TVs.

“We are using the funds and time to prove a point,” says Rafa Gómez-Bombarelli, chief science officer for physical sciences at Lila: “The grant lets us design a real AI robotics loop around a focused scientific problem, generate evidence that it works, and document the playbook so others can reproduce and extend it.”

Another team, from the University of Liverpool, UK, is building a robot chemist, which runs multiple experiments at once and uses a vision language model to help troubleshoot when the robot makes an error.

And a startup based in London, still in stealth mode, is developing an AI scientist called ThetaWorld, which is using LLMs to design experiments on the physical and chemical interactions that are important for the performance of batteries. The experiments will then be run in an automated lab by Sandia National Laboratories in the US.

Compared with the £5 million projects spanning two or three years that ARIA usually funds, £500,000 is small change. But that was the idea, says Rowstron: It’s an experiment on ARIA’s part too. By funding a range of projects for a short amount of time, the agency is taking the temperature at the cutting edge to determine how the way science is done is changing, and how fast. What it learns will become the baseline for funding future large-scale projects.

Rowstron acknowledges there’s a lot of hype, especially now that most of the top AI companies have teams focused on science. When results are shared by press release and not peer review, it can be hard to know what the technology can and can’t do. “That’s always a challenge for a research agency trying to fund the frontier,” he says. “To do things at the frontier, we&#39;ve got to know what the frontier is.”

For now, the cutting edge involves agentic systems calling up other existing tools on the fly. “They’re running things like large language models to do the ideation, and then they use other models to do optimization and run experiments,” says Rowstron. “And then they feed the results back round.”

Rowstron sees the technology stacked in tiers. At the bottom are AI tools designed by humans for humans, such as AlphaFold. These tools let scientists leapfrog slow and painstaking parts of the scientific pipeline but can still require many months of lab work to verify results. The idea of an AI scientist is to automate that work too.

AI scientists sit in a layer above those human-made tools and call ton hose tools as needed, says Rowstron. “But there’s a point in time—and I don’t think it’s a decade away—where that AI scientist layer says, ‘I need a tool and it doesn’t exist,’ and it will actually create an AlphaFold kind of tool just on the way to figuring out how to solve another problem. That whole bottom zone will just be automated.”

That’s still some way off, he says. All the projects ARIA is now funding involve systems that call on existing tools rather than spin up new ones.

There are also unsolved problems with agentic systems in general, which limits how long they can run by themselves without going off track or making errors. For example, a study, titled “Why LLMs aren’t scientists yet,” posted online last week by researchers at Lossfunk, an AI lab based in India, reports that in an experiment to get LLM agents to run a scientific workflow to completion, the system failed three out of four times. According to the researchers, the reasons the LLMs broke down included changes in the initial specifications and “overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures.”

“Obviously, at the moment these tools are still fairly early in their cycle and these things might plateau,” says Rowstron. “I’m not expecting them to win a Nobel Prize.”

“But there is a world where some of these tools will force us to operate so much quicker,” he continues. “And if we end up in that world, it’s super important for us to be ready.”

Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system.

Using Aadhaar as the bedrock, Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society, covering government services, banking, and health care. They offer convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. Read our profile to learn about what he’s set his sights on next.

Many Americans agree that it’s acceptable to screen embryos for severe genetic diseases. Far fewer say it’s okay to test for characteristics related to a future child’s appearance, behavior, or intelligence. But a few startups are now advertising what they claim is a way to do just that.

This new kind of testing—which can cost up to $50,000—is incredibly controversial. Nevertheless, the practice has grown popular in Silicon Valley, and it’s becoming more widely available to everyone. Read the full story.

On the outskirts of Charlottesville, Virginia, a new kind of sugar factory is taking shape. The facility is being developed by a startup called Bonumose. It uses a processed corn product called maltodextrin that is found in many junk foods and is calorically similar to table sugar (sucrose).

But for Bonumose, maltodextrin isn’t an ingredient—it’s a raw material. When it’s poured into the company’s bioreactors, what emerges is tagatose. Found naturally in small concentrations in fruit, some grains, and milk, it is nearly as sweet as sucrose but apparently with only around half the calories, and wider health benefits.

Bonumose’s process originated in a company spun out of the Virginia Tech lab of Yi-Heng “Percival” Zhang. When MIT Technology Review spoke to Zhang, he was sitting alone in an empty lab in Tianjin, China, after serving a two-year sentence of supervised release in Virginia for conspiracy to defraud the US government, making false statements, and obstruction of justice. If sugar is the new oil, the global battle to control it has already begun. Read the full story.

Just before Christmas the Trump administration dramatically escalated its war on digital rights by banning five people from entering the US. One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations. Ballon told us that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. But their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. Read the full story.

Chatbots are skilled at crafting sophisticated dialogue and mimicking empathetic behavior. They never get tired of chatting. It’s no wonder, then, that so many people now use them for companionship—forging friendships or even romantic relationships. 72% of US teenagers have used AI for companionship, according to a study from the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But while chatbots can provide much-needed emotional support and guidance for some people, they can exacerbate underlying problems in others—especially vulnerable people or those with mental health issues.

Although some early attempts to regulate this space are underway, AI companionship is going nowhere.

It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Read our story to learn more about why.

Gavesh’s journey started, seemingly innocently, with a job ad on Facebook promising work he desperately needed.

Instead, he found himself trafficked into a business commonly known as “pig butchering”—a form of fraud in which scammers form close relationships with targets online and extract money from them. The Chinese crime syndicates behind the scams have netted billions of dollars, and they have used violence and coercion to force their workers, many of them trafficked like Gavesh, to carry out the frauds from large compounds, several of which operate openly in the quasi-lawless borderlands of Myanmar.

Big Tech may hold the key to breaking up the scam syndicates—if these companies can be persuaded or compelled to act. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today marks an inflection point for enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in generative AI, only 5% of integrated pilots deliver measurable business value and nearly one in two companies abandons AI initiatives before reaching production.

The bottleneck is not the models themselves. What’s holding enterprises back is the surrounding infrastructure: Limited data accessibility, rigid integration, and fragile deployment pathways prevent AI initiatives from scaling beyond early LLM and RAG experiments. In response, enterprises are moving toward composable and sovereign AI architectures that lower costs, preserve data ownership, and adapt to the rapid, unpredictable evolution of AI—a shift IDC expects 75% of global businesses to make by 2027.

AI pilots almost always work, and that’s the problem. Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.

“PoCs live inside a safe bubble” observes Cristopher Kuehl, chief data officer at Continent 8 Technologies. Data is carefully curated, integrations are few, and the work is often handled by the most senior and motivated teams.

The result, according to Gerry Murray, research director at IDC, is not so much pilot failure as structural mis-design: Many AI initiatives are effectively “set up for failure from the start.”

            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.

            <h2>Sequoia’s big bet on Anthropic</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/sequoia-joins-anthropics-25b-funding-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.

            <h2>Europe’s €307 million AI funding call</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/europes-e307-million-ai-funding-call">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the European Commission announced on 15th of January a €307.3 million funding call for AI and related tech under Horizon Europe earlier this year, the press materials presented it as a strategic push toward trustworthy AI and European digital autonomy. The funding targets trustworthy AI, data services, robotics, quantum, photonics, and what Brussels calls “open strategic autonomy.”

Viewed in isolation, the number itself isn’t eye-popping. By global standards, where the private sector alone pours hundreds of billions into AI, €307 million is barely a rounding error. Yet this sum matters less for its scale and more for what it reveals about Europe’s longstanding dilemma: how to balance ambitious tech leadership with a cautious, value-driven regulatory culture.

What the EU has done here is consistent with a long-running pattern. Brussels has been building an AI ecosystem that explicitly prioritises ethics, safety , and strategic autonomy over raw capability. The “Apply AI Strategy,” which this funding supports, is designed to ensure AI systems are trustworthy and aligned with European values.

This contrasts sharply with the Silicon Valley model, where scale, speed , and commercial dominance often trump wider social aims.
There’s value in that distinction. Too much focus on growth alone can produce outcomes that benefit a few platforms while leaving society to manage the fallout from algorithmic bias , misinformation , and opaque decision-making systems.

Europe’s regulatory framework, including the Artificial Intelligence Act, embeds risk-based guardrails that aim to prevent harm without halting innovation entirely.

But here’s the rub: principle without productivity can feel like good intentions in a vacuum.

Three years into the AI revolution, the EU’s cumulative investments from this €307 million pool to broader programs under Horizon Europe reflect ambition on paper. But across hard metrics like proprietary model development, commercial AI exports, and infrastructure scale, Europe still lags the US and China. In 2025, reports noted Europe produced far fewer notable AI models than its global competitors, a symptom of a deeper ecosystem gap.

Investing in trustworthy AI is laudable; it’s also inherently longer-term, often without the immediate returns that lure commercial capital. By contrast, the US innovation model embraces iterative risk and market experimentation, which helps explain its dominance in foundational model research and deployment.

Here, Europe’s regulatory heft of the AI Act and related oversight mechanisms both help and hinder. Responsible frameworks can build trust and alignment with public values, but if they become too cumbersome, they risk slowing the very innovation they are meant to guide. Bosch’s leadership in Europe has cautioned against “regulating itself to death,” arguing that excessive bureaucracy deters research and deployment.

The €307 million funding explicitly aims to strengthen strategic autonomy and the ability of European innovators to develop AI technologies without dependency on external tech giants.

That’s a worthy goal. Yet autonomy is easier to declare than to realise. Achieving it requires not just funding research but building scale, infrastructure, talent, and market pull simultaneously. Europe’s efforts on AI gigafactories and high-performance computing centres signal long-term intent, but critics still see fragmentation in infrastructure and business support.
In other words, strategic autonomy without substantial ecosystem maturity can feel like sovereignty in theory, not practice.

The question isn’t whether Europe should fund AI research. The question is whether Europe can translate normative leadership into technological leadership.

If the goal is to lead in ethical, human-centric AI that serves public interest first, then this funding fits a broader philosophy. If the goal is to rival the scale and velocity of global tech powers, then incremental investments like this, however well-intentioned, are positions in a longer, incomplete race.

The EU’s approach to AI will succeed only if it pairs principled regulation with bold bets on infrastructure, startups and commercial pathways that scale quickly. That won’t happen through selective research grants alone.

Europe can still carve a distinctive niche in global AI. Its regulatory clarity, public-interest focus and collaborative innovation structures give it moral authority and, over time, competitive strength if it can channel them into meaningful technological outcomes.

For now, the €307 million is a marker on a long road, not a finish line. It signals where Brussels stands: committed to values, cautious by design, and eager to shape the trajectory of AI, even if it’s not yet setting the pace.

EU institutional funding continues to prioritize digital autonomy
Signal: Through Horizon Europe and related instruments, capital allocation is increasingly aligned with infrastructure, security, and sovereignty rather than consumer-driven technology cycles.

ECB commentary reinforces long-term focus on euro stability and autonomy
Signal: The macroeconomic backdrop continues to support policies around financial and digital autonomy, shaping the environment for payments, fintech, and infrastructure investments.

Rising transatlantic tension around EU tech regulation
Signal: Enforcement of DMA and DSA is now a geopolitical issue. Regulatory decisions in Europe are increasingly influencing how global technology firms design products and operations worldwide.

Europe is no longer focused on optimizing digital markets.
It is focused on shaping digital architecture and control points.

For founders, investors, and executives, the implication is clear: resilience, compliance, and strategic positioning in Europe will matter more than speed or scale alone.
