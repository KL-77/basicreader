            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/michigan-accuses-oil-companies-of-antitrust-violations-in-climate-change-lawsuit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Michigan is taking on major oil and gas companies in court, joining nearly a dozen other states that have brought climate-related lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its industry peers. But Michigan’s approach is different: accusing Big Oil not of deceiving consumers or misrepresenting climate change risks, but of driving up energy costs by colluding to suppress competition from cleaner and cheaper technologies like solar power and electric vehicles.

The strategy is risky and might run into challenges, but it could potentially be a game changer if the state can overcome initial dismissal attempts by the industry defendants, legal experts say.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed the lawsuit last month in federal District Court against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute. The suit, brought under federal and state antitrust laws, alleges a conspiracy to delay the transition to renewable energy and EVs and maintain market dominance of fossil fuels.

Exxon said in a statement that the state’s action is “yet another legally incoherent effort to regulate by lawsuit. It won’t reduce emissions, it won’t help consumers, and it won’t stand up to the law.”

Chevron did not respond to a request for comment, and BP and Shell declined to comment.

API senior vice president and general counsel Ryan Meyers said that Michigan’s case is “baseless” and “part of a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.”

“We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms,” Meyers added.

This week during a congressional hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying, U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) referenced Michigan’s lawsuit in arguing that these “novel approaches” to “climate lawfare” require a federal response. Hageman said she is working with House and Senate colleagues to craft legislation aimed at shielding fossil fuel companies from state climate liability laws and lawsuits.

API has been lobbying Congress on exactly this kind of liability shield. The organization has recently lobbied on “draft legislation related to state efforts to impose liability on the oil and gas industry,” according to its lobbying reports. And API is now stating publicly that stopping “extreme climate liability policy” such as lawsuits and state climate superfund laws is one of its top priorities for 2026.

In its lawsuit, Michigan argues that the oil companies and their chief trade association operated as a cartel, working to hinder the development of alternatives in the primary energy and transportation markets in order to keep consumers dependent upon oil and gas. This anticompetitive conduct, the state says, has resulted in fewer choices for consumers when it comes to fueling their cars or heating their homes, and has left consumers paying more for energy than they otherwise would have.

The lawsuit comes at a time of mounting concerns over affordability and the cost of living, including rising energy costs. Nessel said these “out-of-control costs” are largely “due to the greed of these corporations who prioritized their own profit and marketplace dominance over competition and consumer savings.”

According to the state’s complaint, clean energy technologies would have reached scale much sooner, and consumers would have avoided billions of dollars in overcharges, were it not for the defendants’ deliberate actions to forestall their development and deployment.

“Defendants have dramatically delayed the availability of EVs, made 100 percent clean charging stations a rarity, suppressed the advancement of solar technology and its uptake by consumers, and prolonged fossil fuels’ dominance in mixed-source electricity generation,” the complaint argues.

The lawsuit details allegations of coordinated anticompetitive conduct, such as abandoning research and investments in alternative energy technologies and using patent litigation to stifle innovation. Exxon, which invented an early version of the lithium-ion battery, halted its EV battery research program in the early 1980s, while Chevron worked to block commercialization of a nickel-metal hydride battery technology.

Oil companies were also early developers of the solar energy market and controlled much of the sector in the 1980s. But then they abandoned these ventures and, according to the complaint, “used litigation to deter new market entrants.” As attorney Tracy Emblem wrote in a 2010 article, big oil companies “seized and took control of the research and patents” for PV solar in order to thwart its development.

Oil companies understood the threat posed to their business by a large-scale transition away from fossil fuels, the Michigan lawsuit says, and therefore they worked together to try to block alternatives from taking off and to ultimately delay the transition.

The complaint cites a 1979 internal study by Exxon finding that alternatives to fossil fuels would need to account for at least half of global energy supply by 2010 in order to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. That same year, API established a CO2 and Climate Task Force, and through this task force the defendants “reached a consensus to restrain innovation and coordinate efforts to delay the inevitable energy transition,” the complaint alleges.

Proving there was an actual conspiracy or an agreement among the companies, however, is likely to be one of the biggest challenges for the state, legal experts say.

“In establishing an antitrust claim, essentially a conspiracy, you need to prove an agreement,” Gary Mouw, partner at the Michigan-based law firm Varnum LLP, told Inside Climate News. “You need to allege sufficient facts, specific concrete facts where it can be concluded or interpreted that these parties actually entered into an agreement to coordinate.”

He said he expects the defendants will argue that the allegations lack specificity and that there was no established consensus to collude.

Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor of law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, agreed that proving the alleged conspiracy might be the biggest sticking point for the state plaintiffs.

“They’ve really got to nail down, what is the overt evidence of the conspiracy to constrain trade? What documents reveal these parties getting together and agreeing that we’re going to choke renewables?” Parenteau told Inside Climate News.

“The theories are solid,” he added. “Surviving a motion to dismiss is the ball game, I think. If [the state] can get past a motion to dismiss, get into discovery, get to trial, then they’ve got a shot.”

Michigan is not the first to allege that fossil fuel companies engaged in conspiratorial conduct. California, for example, which sued a handful of major oil and gas firms in 2023, argued that the companies conspired to misrepresent the known dangers of fossil fuels and to disseminate climate disinformation while promoting continued use of fossil fuel products.

Several other lawsuits filed against the industry include racketeering and related conspiracy claims. One of these cases, filed in 2022 by Puerto Rican municipalities, also brought a federal antitrust claim against fossil fuel companies. While a magistrate judge had recommended that the case should proceed under racketeering and antitrust claims, a federal district court judge decided to dismiss the case in September based on a procedural statute of limitations issue. The Puerto Rican municipalities are appealing that decision.

Mouw said he expects that defendants in the Michigan lawsuit will likely raise a similar statute of limitations defense, essentially arguing that the claims were not brought in a timely manner.

But while Puerto Rico’s lawsuit sought to hold fossil fuel companies liable for damages stemming from the 2017 hurricanes that decimated the island, Michigan’s case is less focused around a specific event, Aaron Regunberg, a lawyer and director of Public Citizen’s climate accountability project, explained. “It is an ongoing conspiracy with ongoing harms,” he told Inside Climate News. “I think it’s better insulated from a statute of limitations argument.”

Regunberg said he thinks the approach of bringing antitrust claims against Big Oil for delaying the energy transition is compelling and appropriate.

“It really gets at the fundamental thing that Big Oil was trying to do,” he said. “Ultimately it was about shutting out competitors, keeping their energy cartel dominant over the market, in order to keep us locked into their products and keep alternative clean energy from reaching scale.”

Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham Law School with expertise in antitrust law, told Inside Climate News that Michigan’s case looks very promising.

“For generations fossil fuel companies have engaged in cartel-like behaviors to suppress innovation and lock down the flow of cash,” she said. “They hide in trade associations but there’s no free speech protection for cartels, and I’m glad to see the case.”

Michigan’s lawsuit comes amidst escalating attempts by the fossil fuel industry and its political allies to shut down climate liability initiatives.

“As more than a dozen states and communities move closer to putting Big Oil on trial, and as climate superfund laws begin to take hold, the industry is turning to Congress for protection. API has said plainly that stopping climate liability is a top priority and now we are seeing legislation take shape to do exactly that,” Cassidy DiPaola, communications director for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, said in response to Hageman’s announcement that she is working with congressional colleagues to craft a federal liability shield for energy companies.

“If these companies believe they did nothing wrong, they should be willing to defend that position in court,” DiPaola added. “Instead, they are asking lawmakers to block the cases altogether.”

State lawmakers in Utah and Oklahoma recently introduced bills that aim to shield the fossil fuel industry from climate lawsuits and prohibit liability over climate damages. Both bills are currently advancing in the state legislatures.

In April 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the attorney general to identify and “expeditiously take all appropriate action to stop” state laws and lawsuits that burden domestic fossil fuel production or otherwise target the fossil fuel industry.

Just weeks later, the U.S. Department of Justice sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund laws. The DOJ also preemptively sued Hawaii and Michigan in anticipation of those states bringing climate lawsuits against oil companies, even though neither state had filed any case at the time. Hawaii did file a complaint against oil companies the next day.

Michigan, however, did not file its suit until just recently, and it ended up departing from the expected focus on climate damages. The DOJ argued in its complaint that Michigan’s forthcoming suit would be unconstitutional and preempted by the Clean Air Act. U.S. District Judge Jane M. Beckering, who is now presiding over Michigan’s antitrust lawsuit, tossed out the DOJ’s case the day after the state filed its suit against Big Oil.

Beckering said the DOJ’s case was too speculative and premature, and that there appeared to be no precedent for preemptively blocking a party from bringing “a broad swath of unspecified claims against unspecified members of a given industry simply because that party has begun investigating whether a litigation strategy may have merit.”

“I am relieved the Court saw through this and dismissed this frivolous case,” Nessel, the Michigan attorney general, said in response. “My office will not be bullied.”

Nessel put out a request for outside counsel in 2024 to assist with pursuing climate litigation against fossil fuel companies, and the state subsequently entered into contingency contracts with the law firms Sher Edling, DiCello Levitt and Hausfeld. What had started as an investigative strategy of holding fossil fuel companies liable for climate impacts in the state, however, instead “uncovered one of the most successful antitrust conspiracies in United States history,” according to Nessel’s office.

Antitrust experts say the state’s case takes a novel approach, and one that tests the bounds of traditional antitrust law.

“I think there are some challenges here, especially when the court looks at what else would this apply to if we were to adopt this theory: Would this really expand liability for antitrust beyond what it was really meant for?” Mouw said.

“The Michigan case is a novel application of a classic principle of the antitrust laws—that agreements between competitors to restrict output are illegal,” Nicole Veno, an antitrust lawyer and senior associate at Lowey Dannenberg, told Inside Climate News. “While the theory of liability appears strong, to prove damages Michigan will also need to show that it was economically harmed by the failure to invest in alternative energy sources, which could prove more challenging.”

If the case does move ahead, climate advocates say they are hopeful that it will open up new pathways for pursuing accountability.

“I’m excited to see how this case goes,” Public Citizen’s Regunberg said, “and would hope it would be a model for a lot of other plaintiffs who are hopefully going to be bringing more suits like it.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/02/learning-the-limits-of-stability-control-on-a-frozen-lake-in-a-mclaren/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SAARISELKÄ, FINLAND—If you’re expecting it, the feeling in the pit of your stomach when the rear of your car breaks traction and begins to slide is rather pleasant. It’s the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you’re in the driver’s seat, you’re in charge of the ride.

When you’re not expecting it, though, there’s anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too.

Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems. For more than 30 years, these electronic safety nets have grown in capability and became mandatory in the early 2010s, saving countless crashes in the process.

Through a combination of cutting engine power and individually braking each wheel, the computers that keep a watchful eye on things like lateral acceleration and wheel spin gather it all together with the idea that the car goes where the driver wants it rather than sideways or backward into whatever solid object lies along the new path of motion.

Obviously, the quickest way to find out whether this all works is to turn it off. And then find a slippery road, or just drive like an oaf. Yet even when automakers let journalists loose on racetracks, they invariably require that we keep some of the electronic safety net turned on. Even on track, you can hit things that will crumple a car—or worse—and with modern tire technology being what it is, the speeds involved when cars do let go tend to be quite high, particularly if it’s dry.

There are few environments that are more conducive to exploring the limits and capabilities of electronic chassis control. Ideally, you want a lot of wide-open space free of wildlife and people and a smooth, low-grip surface. A giant sand dune would work. Or a frozen lake. Which is why you can sometimes find automotive engineers hanging out in these remote, often extreme locations, braving the desert’s heat or an Arctic chill as they work on a prototype or fine-tune the next model.

And it’s no secret that sliding a car on the ice is a lot fun. So it’s not surprising that a cottage tourism industry exists that—for a suitable fee—will bring you north of the Arctic Circle where you can work on your car control and get some insight into just how hard those electronics are capable of working.

That explains why I left an extremely cold Washington, DC, to travel to an even colder Saariselkä in Finland, where McLaren operates its Arctic Experience program on a frozen lake in nearby Ivalo. The company does some development work here, though more of it happens across the border in Sweden. But for a few weeks each winter, it welcomes customers to its minimalist lodge to work on their car control. And earlier this month, Ars was among a group of journalists who got an abbreviated version of the experience.

Our car for the day was a Ventura Orange McLaren Artura, the brand’s plug-in hybrid supercar, wearing Pirelli’s Sottozero winter tires, each augmented by a few hundred metal spikes. Its total power and torque output is 671 hp (500 kW) and 531 lb-ft (720 Nm) combined from a 3.0 L twin-turbo V6 that generates 577 hp (430 kW) and 431 lb-ft (584 Nm), plus an axial flux electric motor that contributes an additional 94 hp (70 kW) and 166 lb-ft (225 Nm). All of that is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission.

Where most hybrids use the electric motor to boost efficiency, McLaren mostly uses it to boost performance, providing an immediate shove and filling gaps in the torque band where necessary. In electric-only mode, it will do just that, right up to the 81 mph (130 km/h) speed limit of the mode. Being the sort of curious nerd I am, I took the opportunity to try all the different modes.

Once I got control of my stomach, that is.

Our first exercise was ironically the hardest: driving sideways around a plain old circle. A couple of these had been scribed into the ice—which freezes from November until April and was 28 inches (70 cm) thick, we learned—along with more than a dozen other, more involved courses. Even under the best of conditions, the Sun spends barely six hours a day on its shallow curve from horizon to horizon at this time of year. On the day of our visit, the horizon was an indistinct thing as heavy gray skies blended with the snow-covered ice.

The lack of a visual reference, mixed with 15 minutes of steady lateral G-forces, turned out to be unkind to my vestibular system, and about 10 minutes later, I found myself in shirtsleeves at minus-11˚F (minus-23˚C), saying goodbye to a cup of Earl Grey tea I’d previously and perhaps unwisely drunk a little earlier. At least I remembered to face downwind—given the sideways gale, it could have ended worse.

Fortified with an anti-emetic and some extremely fresh air, I returned to the ice and can happily report that as long as you slide both left and right, you’re unlikely to get nauseous.

Getting an Artura sideways on a frozen lake is not especially complicated. With the powertrain set to Track, which prioritizes performance and keeps the V6 running the whole time, and with stability and traction control off, you apply enough power to break traction at the rear. Or a dab of brake could do the job, too, followed by some power. You steer more with your right foot than your hands, adding or subtracting power to reign in or amplify the slip angle. Your eyes are crucial to the process; if you look through the corner down the track, that’s probably where you’ll end up. Fixate on the next apex and you may quickly find yourself off-course.

Most of the mid-engined Artura’s 3,303 lbs (1,498 kg) live between its axles, and it’s a relatively easy car to catch once it begins to slide, with plenty of travel for the well-mapped throttle pedal.

As it turns out, that holds true even when you’re using only the electric motor. 166 lb-ft is more than enough to get the rear wheels spinning on the ice, but with just 94 hp, there isn’t really enough power to get the car properly sideways. So you can easily control a lazy slide around one of the handling courses, in near silence, to boot. Turn the electronic aids back on and things got much less dramatic; even with my foot to the floor, the Artura measured out minute amounts of power, keeping the car very much pointed where I steered it rather than requiring any opposite lock.

Back in track mode, with all 671 hp to play with, there was much more power than necessary to spin. But with the safety net re-enabled, driving around the handling course was barely any more dramatic than with a fraction of the power. The car’s electronic chassis control algorithms would only send as much power to the rear wheels as they could deploy, no matter how much throttle I applied. As each wheel lost grip and began to spin, its brake would intervene. And we went around the course, slowly but safely. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of modern electronic safety systems, it was very reassuring.

As I mentioned earlier, even when journalists are let loose in supercars on track, it’s with some degree of electronic assist enabled. Because for the sportier kind of car, you’ll often find some degree of halfway house between everything on and buttoned down and all the aids turned off. Here, the idea is to loosen the safety net and allow the car to move around, but only a little. Instead of just using the electronics to make things safe, they’ll also flatter the driver.

In McLaren’s case, that mode is called Variable Drift Control, which is a rather accurate name—in this mode, you set the maximum slip angle (from 1˚–15˚), and the car will not exceed that. And that’s exactly what it does. A slug of power will get the rear wheels spinning and the rear sliding, but only up to the set degree, at which point the brakes and powertrain will interrupt as necessary.

It’s very flattering, holding what feels like a lurid slide between turns with ease, without any concern that a lapse in concentration might leave the car requiring recovery after beaching on a few inches of snow. Even when your right foot is pinned to the firewall, the silicon brains running the show apply only as much torque as necessary, with the little icon flashing on the dash letting you know it’s intervening.

I can certainly see why OEMs ask that modes like VDC are the spiciest setting we try when they lend us their cars. They’re just permissive enough to break the rear loose and fire off a burst of adrenaline, yet cosseting enough that the ride almost certainly won’t end in tears. Fun though VDC was to play with, it does feel artificial once you get your eye in—particularly compared to the thrill of balancing an Artura on the throttle as you change direction through a series of corners or the satisfaction of catching and recovering a spin before it becomes too late.

But outside of a frozen lake, I’ll be content to keep some degree of driver aids running.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Crew Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Valentine’s Day, and astronauts popped open the hatches at 5:14 pm ET (22:14 UTC) on Saturday evening.

The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew 12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—brought the total number of crew on board the space station to seven, giving the US space agency a full complement in orbit.

The number of astronauts living on board the station fluctuates over time, depending on crew rotations and private astronauts making shorter stays, but since Crew Dragon began flying regularly at the end of 2020 NASA has sought to keep at least four “USOS” astronauts on board at all time. This stands for “US Orbital Segment,” and means astronauts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan who are trained to operate the areas of the station maintained by NASA and its partner astronauts.

However, after one of the four Crew-11 astronauts experienced a health emergency a few days into the new year, NASA made an unprecedented decision to bring them home early. NASA has not named the afflicted Crew-11 astronaut, but the flier is said to be recovering on Earth.

After these astronauts departed on January 15, just a single NASA astronaut, Chris Williams, remained in orbit. He had reached space on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in November, alongside two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev. The space station is a big place, and with much of the facility now more than two decades old, Williams had to spend the majority of his time on maintenance and monitoring activities.

Back on Earth, NASA and SpaceX engineers were busy too. Because Crew 11 was brought home more than a month early, NASA and SpaceX scrambled to launch the Crew-12 vehicle a little sooner than expected, to minimize the time Williams had to manage the large US segment of the station on his own.

That culminated with a successful Dragon launch early on Friday, with the reinforcements reaching the space station on Saturday evening.

“This mission has shown, in many ways, what it means to be mission focused at NASA,” said the space agency’s administrator, Jared Isaacman, during a post-launch news conference. “In the last couple of weeks we brought Crew 11 home early, we pulled forward Crew 12, all while simultaneously making launch preparations for the Artemis II mission. It’s only possible because of the incredibly talented workforce we have here at NASA alongside our contractors, and our commercial and international partners.”</div>

            <h2>Ancient Mars was warm and wet, not cold and icy</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A recent study showed that Mars was warm and wet billions of years ago. The finding contrasts with another theory that this era was mainly cold and icy. The result has implications for the idea that life could have developed on the planet at this time.

Whether Mars was once habitable is a fascinating and intensely researched topic of interest over many decades. Mars, like the Earth, is about 4.5 billion years old and its geological history is divided into different epochs of time.

The latest paper relates to Mars during a time called the Noachian epoch, which extended from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. This was during a stage in solar system history called the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). Evidence for truly cataclysmic meteorite impacts during the LHB are found on many bodies throughout the solar system.

Two obvious scars from this era on Mars are the enormous Hellas and Argyre impact basins; both are well over a thousand miles across and each possesses enough volume to hold all the water in the Mediterranean with room to spare.

One might not imagine such a time being conducive to the existence of fragile lifeforms, yet it is likely to be the era in which Mars was most habitable. Evidence of landforms sculpted by water from this time is plentiful and include dried-up river valleys, lake beds, ancient coastlines and river deltas.

The prevailing climatic conditions of the Noachian are still a matter of intense debate. Two alternative scenarios are
typically posited: that this time was cold and icy, with occasional melting of large volumes of frozen water by meteorite impact and volcanic eruptions, or that it was warm, wet and largely ice-free.

All stars, including the Sun, brighten with age. In the early solar system, during the Noachian, the Sun was about 30% dimmer than it is today, so less heat was reaching Mars (and all the planets). To sustain a warm, wet climate at this time, the Martian atmosphere would have needed to be very substantial – much thicker than it is today – and abundant in greenhouse gases like CO2.

But when reaching high enough atmospheric pressure, CO2 tends to condense out of the air to form clouds and reduce the greenhouse effect. Given these issues, the cold, icy scenario is perhaps more believable.

One of the main science goals of the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, which landed spectacularly in February 2021, is to seek evidence to support either of these two scenarios, and the new
paper using data from Perseverance may have done just that.

Perseverance landed at the Martian location of Jezero crater, which was selected as the landing site because it once contained a lake. Views of the crater from orbit show several distinct fan-shaped deposits emanating from channels carved through the crater walls by flowing water. Within these channels are abundant deposits of clay minerals.

The new paper details recent analysis of aluminum-rich clay pebbles, called kaolinite, located within one of the ancient flow channels. The pebbles appear to have been subjected to intense weathering and chemical alteration by water during the Noachian.

While this is perhaps not surprising for a known ancient watery environment, what is interesting is that these clays are strongly depleted in iron and magnesium, and enriched in titanium and aluminum.

This is important because it means these rocks were less likely to have been altered in a hydrothermal environment, where scalding hot water was temporarily released by melting ice caused by volcanism or a meteorite impact.

Instead, they appear to have been altered under modest temperatures and persistent heavy rainfall. The authors found distinct similarities between the chemical composition of these clay pebbles with similar clays found on Earth dating from periods in our planet’s history when the climate was much warmer and wetter.

The paper concludes that these kaolinite pebbles were altered under high rainfall conditions comparable to “past greenhouse climates on Earth” and that they “likely represent some of the wettest intervals and possibly most habitable portions of Mars’ history”.

Furthermore, the paper concludes that these conditions may have persisted over time periods ranging from thousands to millions of years. Perseverance recently made headlines also for the discovery of possible biosignatures in samples it collected last year, also from within Jezero crater.

These precious samples have now been cached in special sealed containers on the rover for collection by a future Mars sample return mission. Unfortunately, the mission has recently been cancelled by Nasa and so what vital evidence they may or may not contain will probably not be examined in an Earth-based laboratory for many years.

Crucial to this future analysis is the so-called “Knoll criterion” – a concept formulated by astrobiologist Andrew Knoll, which states that for something to be evidence of life, an observation has to not just be explicable by biology; it has to be inexplicable without it. Whether these samples ever satisfy the Knoll criterion will only be known if they can be brought to Earth.

Either way, it is quite striking to imagine a time on Mars, billions of years before the first humans walked the Earth, that a tropical climate with – possibly – a living ecosystem once existed in the now desolate and wind-swept landscape of Jezero crater.

            <div id="article-text">On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published an article containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.

That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.

Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.

We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?

The film has been analysed and re-analysed countless times. Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature.

But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in the duo’s recent book “Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science.”

Here, we talk to them about their academic investigation.

Lewis: It started when I was watching either the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and a show called Finding Bigfoot was advertised. I was really keen to know why this program was being scheduled on what certainly at the time was a nominally serious and sober natural history channel. The initial plan was to do an analysis of these television programmes, but we felt that wasn’t enough. It was lockdown and my wife was pregnant and in bed a lot with sickness, so I needed to fill my time.

Bartlett: One of the things that I worked on when Jamie and I shared an office in Cardiff was a sociological study of fringe physicists. These are people mostly outside of academic institutions trying to do science. I was interviewing these people, going to their conferences. And that led relatively smoothly into Bigfoot, but it was Jamie’s interest in Bigfoot that brought me to this field.

Lewis: It’s very hard to put a number on it. There is certainly a divide between what are known as “apers,” who believe that Bigfoot is just a primate unknown to science, and those that are perhaps more derogatorily called “woo-woos,” who believe that Bigfoot is some sort of interdimensional traveller, an alien of sort. We’re talking in the thousands of people. But there are a couple of hundred really serious people of which I probably interviewed at least half.

Many people back them. A YouGov survey conducted as recently as November 2025, suggested that as many as one quarter of Americans believe that Bigfoot either definitely or probably exists.

Lewis: I think there was definitely a worry that they would be caricatured. And I was often asked, “Do I believe in Bigfoot?” I had a standard answer that Andy and I agreed on, which was that mainstream, institutional science says there is absolutely no compelling evidence that Bigfoot exists. We have no reason to dissent with that consensus. But as sociologists what does exist is a community (or communities) of Bigfooting, and that’s what interests us.

Bartlett: One of the things that at least a couple of people reacted to once the book was published was the way we phrased that. On the blurb on the back of the book we say something along the lines of “Bigfoot exists if not as a physical biological creature then certainly as an object around which hundreds of people organise their lives.” A couple of people took that to be some kind of slight against them. It wasn’t.

Lewis: The community is very white, male, rural, and blue collar—often ex-military. I think Bigfooting is growing among the female population, but there’s a sense of the kind of ‘masculine hunter in the dark’ persona.

Bartlett: In America, you find a lot more veterans in the general population. But I think there’s also the issue of how they like to present themselves, because when you’re dealing with witness testimony, you’ve got to present yourself as credible. If you can say something like, “I was in the service” or “I was in the armed forces,” then at least you’re not likely to be spooked by a moose.

Lewis: Some were very articulate, which did surprise me a little. I guess that’s my own prejudice. I was also very surprised about how open people were; I expected them to not tell me about their encounters. But a fair few of them did. Many of them wanted to be named in the book. I was also surprised about how much empirical data they collect and how much they attempt to try and analyse and make sense of it. And how they were willing to admit that a certain idea was bunk or a hoax. I expected them to be defending bad evidence.

Bartlett: There are extracts of this in our book, people saying “I was fooled by these tracks for ages. I thought they were real and then I found this and that and the other out about it and I revised my opinion.” So that did surprise me too.

Bartlett: When you’re working in institutional science you’re working to get grants, you’re working to get good quality publications. You might want your name associated with particular ideas, but you do that through peer-reviewed papers and by working with PhD students who go off to other labs. In Bigfooting, you’ve got self-published books, you’ve got Bigfoot conferences, you’ve got YouTube channels, you’ve got podcasts and things like this, and they’re not necessarily a good way of making and testing knowledge claims. This is an aspect where Bigfooting is quite different to mainstream science.

It was interesting to study the fringe physicists and seeing where the common deviation from science was. And that’s a focus on individualism; the idea that an individual alone can collect and assess evidence in some kind of asocial fashion. The physicists I studied were quite clear that ideas like consensus in science were dangerous, when in reality, consensus, continuity, and community are the basis of most of science.

Lewis: Witness testimonies. Without those reported testimonies, Bigfooting would not exist. A large part of the work of a Bigfooter is to collect and make sense of these testimonies. They get upset when these testimonies don’t have much weight within institutional science. They’ll make the comparison to court and how testimonies alone can put someone on death row. So they don’t understand why testimonies don’t have much weight in science. Beyond the testimony, footprint evidence is probably the most famous and also the most pervasive sort of trace evidence.

Bartlett: One of the reasons footprints are so important is that there’s the legacy of the Yeti and footprint evidence which proved to be relatively persuasive, convincing some institutional scientists that there was something in the Himalayas. And then there was the fact that the sort of two major academic champions of Bigfoot were persuaded by the footprint evidence: the late Grover Krantz (around 1970) and Jeffrey Meldrum (in the 1990s).

Lewis: These days, you also see camera traps, audio recorders, even DNA testing of hairs and those sorts of things. They’re capturing anomalous sounds and often blurry images. Some believe that a Bigfoot communicates through infrasound, although that is certainly disputed within the community. So what you’re getting now is more and more different types of evidence.

Bartlett: What they do is go out into the forest and record a sound, for example, and compare it to databases of birds and other animals. And they may find there is nothing that matches it. Is it something that doesn’t sound like a car or a person or a bear or a moose? In which case, there’s the space for Bigfoot. And it’s the same with images to some degree.

Lewis: It allows them to create space for Bigfoot. Because if you can’t match it to something else, what could it be? You have this absence and then from that absence you create a presence. They believe it’s a scientific argument. In fact, it’s kind of interesting how Bigfooters will always enrol other kinds of magical beasts to strengthen the case for Bigfoot. So, one sentence I hear quite a lot is “it ain’t no unicorn.”

Lewis: A-listers tend to be anyone associated with academia. So Andy’s already mentioned Jeff Meldrum, unfortunately he passed away very recently, but he was their route to contemporary academia. So in any conference, if Jeff Meldrum was speaking, he’d be last. Anyone who’s on TV, such as the Finding Bigfoot and the Expedition Bigfoot presenters would also be in the A-list category. And then you’ve got various different groups just below. For example, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which is probably the most well-known group.

Lewis: From reading books and from discussing it with people, there was a sense that Bigfooters are anti-science. We did not find that. What we argue in the book is that they’re not anti-science. In fact, I would say a lot of them are pro-science, but they’re counter-establishment. I think academia should be thinking about these people as citizen scientists and what they’re doing as a kind of gateway into understanding your local area.

For example, they found an animal, I think it was a pine marten, on a camera trap that was not supposed to be in the area. So they are collecting lots of data. They are not irrational. It’s different from, for example, ghost hunting, because you don’t have to imagine there’s something entirely new in the world. It’s just an animal that exists out there that hasn’t been found. Implausible, yes. But not impossible. What they do lack, however, is academic discipline; anyone can be a Bigfooter.

Lewis: Did I get caught up in the moment? Sometimes, of course, you do, just as you do in a film. If you’re in the pitch dark night and you’re watching a horror film, you take it away with you for a while until you settle back down. I often went to bed buzzing, thinking I don’t know what I just heard; they were great stories at the end of the day. But I learned to separate the interview from my thoughts on the interview.

Lewis: A lot of Bigfooters would begin with qualifiers like, “My dad doesn’t believe in Bigfoot,” or “I have questioned myself for years thinking about this incident and what it was.” So, they would set themselves up as a rational, logical individual. That then created a connection between me and them. And of course, I’d probably be doing the same.

Bartlett: If I were to encounter Bigfoot, I would probably draw on all the techniques of proving that I’m a credible, hard-headed, rational person that we see in those witness encounters. I would expect to be disbelieved. And so therefore I would stress I was putting my credibility as an academic on the line here. So I’d deploy all those kinds of rhetorical techniques that are used by Bigfooters, aside from just the description of the encounter.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly 500 elementary school children in Texas play on fields where a whistleblower says he once spread tons of radioactive fracking waste — a noxious hell-brew he believes melted the bones in his own jaw.

Lee Oldham is a 52-year-old former waste disposal worker from Cleburne, Texas, on the southern outskirts of Dallas-Fort Worth. In an interview with Texas-based publication the Barbed Wire, Oldham detailed how he went from waste handler to corporate whistleblower, and the horrifying apathy of state politicians that led him there.

Since the fracking boom of the 2000s, Oldham made his living dumping drilling mud and contaminated fracking dirt into open fields across North Texas. Though the Texas state oil and gas regulator technically forbade companies from dumping their sludge wherever they pleased, a 2016 audit found the regulator offered “little deterrent effect” to prevent it.

Instead of disposing of the fracking sludge the official way — which involved extra paperwork, expensive land designations, and tons of extra man-hours — Oldham’s company, like many others, chose to work it into empty fields.

“The whole thing operated on the honor system,” Oldham told the Barbed Wire. “And the only honor you can bank on in the oil and gas industry is there ain’t nothing honorable being done.”

In total, the Dallas-Fort Worth area is now host to somewhere between 20 and 60 million tons of hazardous waste, dredged up by the 21,000 oil and gas wells that call the place home. As fracking involves blasting through shale teeming with naturally toxic materials to find oil and gas, that waste is surely brimming with a noxious potpourri of heavy metals and radionuclides, as well as PFAS introduced during the drilling process.

As Oldham’s medical records, which were viewed by Barbed Wire show, the 52-year-old’s jaw bone has become “seriously degraded” following his stint in the oil-waste trade. His vertebrae had also broken down, another telltale sign of radiation poisoning.

While the waste sites would be dangerous enough as tracts of farmland — plenty of which have sprouted up on former dumping grounds — one particular site Oldham showed Barbed Wire is located under a brand-new suburban development. Called “Silo Mills,” the community hosts some 2,500 homes just 30 minutes away from downtown Fort Worth.

It also boasts Pleasant View Elementary School, a Pre-K to 5th grade school building built on a field where Oldham and his co-workers used to dump fracking waste.

Oldham left his previous employer after he says his questions about radioactive waste made him a target for retaliation. He has now started sounding the alarm on Facebook, drawing the attention of local law enforcement.

Whether the authorities uncover a verifiable public health threat to the new town of Silo Mills remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: with radioactive waste in play, it’ll be thousands of years before the area surrounding Dallas-Fort Worth fully recovers from the fracking boom.

            <div id="article-text">To hell with your Fermi paradox: we’ve got presidential declarations.

During a podcast interview with political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released Sunday, former president Barack Obama casually remarked — and in the eyes of certain wild-eyed conspiracists, confirmed — that aliens exist.

“They’re real,” Obama said coolly when asked about their existence, “but I haven’t seen them.”

“And they’re not being kept in… what is it? Area 51,” he continued. “There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

As Obama conspicuously sipped his tea, Cohen fired off another query: “what was the first question that you wanted answered when you became president?”

Obama replied with a smile: “Where are the aliens?”

If you take Obama at his word, it was fresh-off-the-grill nothingburger. Like NASA’s top scientists and most well-informed space enthusiasts, the 42nd president was saying that though he strongly suspects life is out there somewhere, he’s seen no confirmation of it himself.

But the remarks, which came during the podcast’s “lightning round” segment, kicked up a storm of speculation, especially amid official investigations into the UFO phenomenon reaching the floor of Congress. Self-proclaimed body language experts came out in droves, analyzing the eye contact Obama made during the exchange. Particularly galaxy-brained observers even pointed to how confidently Obama asserted his point as a counterintuitive indication that he must’ve seen some definitive evidence of aliens’ existence during his stint in the Oval Office.

Meanwhile, Obama was probably reminded of what it was like to be president, when every comment and gesture carries the authority of office and is scrutinized and fed into a vicious news cycle. Point in fact, he issued a follow up statement on Instagram to clarify what he intended with his aliens remarks, saying that he was only trying to “stick with the spirit of the speed round.”

“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he elaborated. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

We wouldn’t be surprised if that sparked yet more conspiracy theorizing. Obama is getting nervous, they could say. The deep state pulled a few strings to remind him of who’s really in charge. The Greys’ ambassador denounced the reckless comments on the floor of the Shadow Council, sparking a momentary diplomatic crisis.

This isn’t the first time Obama generated headlines for talking about aliens (which in fact has happened a surprising amount). In a 2015 appearance on the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” show, he joked that aliens would block the release of Area 51 files, because “they exercise strict control over us.”

Of course, the most likely explanation is also the most dull: that you can take Obama literally when he says he suspects alien life is out there somewhere, but that he’s seen no direct evidence in an official capacity. Perhaps the strongest evidence for that banal conclusion: if the government really did did have evidence of aliens, Obama’s outburst-prone successor Donald Trump probably would have accidentally blurted it out by now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gambling has taken over the country. But it’s not just sports betting that’s emptying wallets. Now, the rise of prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi to bet on almost any conceivable outcome, ranging from presidential elections to military interventions to celebrity dramas to the return of our lord and savior Jesus Christ.

The nature of the wagers open up whole new avenues of insider trading and other dishonest practices. Take, for example, the Polymarket bet on the number of tweets Elon Musk will make between February 6 and February 13, which currently has nearly $15 million worth of bets placed. What’s stopping Musk from seeing this and telling a friend how much he’s going to tweet? The answer: practically nothing — hence the numerous scandals that have already emerged over this clear vulnerability.

Just as nefarious is that prediction markets have perfected a wildly addictive formula, especially among young, inexperienced bettors. Part of the appeal is that instead of betting against the house, these platforms claim, you’re betting against other players (though the fine print suggests otherwise). It’s also simpler: either the thing happens, or it doesn’t happen. Adding to that, the prediction markets project credibility through partnerships with news organizations like CNN, which now display their data during broadcasts.

All of this is clearly working. Some users don’t even think of betting as the kind of activity that was once fodder for mob movies and New Hollywood tragicomedies, and more as an investment.

“I wouldn’t describe it as gambling” but a “mix of betting and options trading,” 21-year-old Yadin Eldar, a Florida State University student who’s been betting on prediction markets since 2019, told The Guardian. “It’s not like when you go to the casino, and play against the house, and hope you get to win against the house,” he added. “That’s not what it is.”

Given their freshness in the mainstream, there isn’t as much hard data on prediction markets yet. But one recent analysis found that Polymarket and Kalshi users were losing money faster compared to traditional sports gambling platforms. (The finding was so controversial that Kalshi lashed out by accusing the report of being part of an “extortion plot” before backing down.)

In any case, it’s clear that gambling apps are on an upward trajectory. A study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that online searches for gambling addiction help rose 23 percent between 2018 — the year a court ruling essentially legalized sports betting — and 2023. During roughly that same period, total sports wagers skyrocketed from $4.9 billion to $121.1 billion. An early 2025 survey showed that nearly a quarter of US adults admitted to being sports betting addicts, which was an even higher 37 percent with Gen Z.

And prediction markets in particular appear to be winning over the youth. Another survey from this January showed that millennials and Gen Z were more aware of specific prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi than older demographics, while the opposite tended to be true for traditional sports betting platforms.

One 25-year-old former financial risk analyst told NPR he quit his job to bet on Kalshi and Polymarket full time. Another 25-year-old who started his own company to trade on prediction markets told The Wall Street Journal he lost around $100,000 in bets he placed on the Super Bowl.

“It seems like everything is gambling now, and the appetite for gambling on the most obscure stuff is pretty bonkers,” Danny Funt, author of the new book “Everybody Loses: The Tumultuous Rise of American Sports Gambling,” told Axios. “This is seemingly reaching new levels.”

“This used to be something people did discreetly,” he added. Now, it’s “normalized.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate change is leaving plenty of dramatic reminders behind as it reshapes our planet, from rapidly retreating glaciers to more frequent extreme weather events.

Forests are also bearing the brunt of global warming. Scientists recently examined satellite data ranging from 1985 to 2020 and made a striking discovery: that boreal forests, the largest terrestrial biome on Earth — and which are warming faster than any other type of forest — are steadily shifting northwards as they retreat from the heat.

Boreal forests play a key role as one of the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sinks. But how much longer they can sequester excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains uncertain as global temperatures continue to rise.

As detailed in a new study published in the journal Biogeosciences, an international team of researchers — including from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center — analyzed imagery from the space agency’s Landsat satellites.

They created a detailed map of tree cover at a resolution of 100 feet to track changes over a 36-year time span. The finding was stark: that boreal forests not only had grown by 12 percent, but had shifted northward by 0.29 degrees of mean latitude.

“These findings confirm the northward advance of the boreal forest and implicate the future importance of the region’s greening to the global carbon budget,” they concluded in their paper.

The implications these changes have on climate change and the future of our planet are nuanced, given the degree of complexity involved. On one hand, a growth in young boreal trees could allow the forests to soak up more carbon in the atmosphere, an estimated 1.1 to 5.9 gigatonnes. To put that number into perspective, all of the world’s trees hold approximately 861 gigatonnes of carbon.

“These changes are not only spatially extensive but demographically consequential: they reflect a growing fraction of young forests with distinct structural and functional attributes that position them as dynamic agents of carbon sequestration,” the team wrote in their paper. “Understanding the contribution of these forests to current and future carbon stocks is essential for anticipating the net climate feedbacks emerging from boreal ecosystems.”

At the same time, an increasingly extreme climate could complicate the picture, sparking enormous wildfires across western Canada as outbreaks of destructive species like the bark beetle cause major losses of pine boreal forests.

Scientists are warning that shorter winters and hotter temperatures in the summer are also resulting in longer dry spells that can cause soils to dry out and harmful algae blooms to form in lakes.

In short, boreal forests may be growing and allowing them to suck up more greenhouse gases, but climate change is also putting them at a much higher risk of tree cover loss due to drought, wildfires, diseases, insect outbreaks, and so on, potentially offsetting any long-term benefits.

“Although the net trends are globally significant, they mask substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity, as well as complexity in the ecological processes underlying forest change,” the researchers concluded.

“A more complete understanding of boreal forest dynamics will require integration of satellite time series with field-based measurements of canopy structure and the environmental drivers of growth, mortality, and species turnover,” they wrote. “Moreover, translating the resulting information into action to forestall and adapt to climate change will require effective communication across scientific, government, and commercial domains of human activity.”

            <div id="article-text">The internet is so overrun with AI that anywhere you go, you run the risk of accidentally stepping into a puddle of slop. If only there were a gallant gentleman always at hand to drape their coat over these muddy obstacles so you could avoid ruining your day.

It’s not quite on that level, but some netizens are proposing a new term to call out AI slop so other people can avoid wasting their time — or to just make fun of the person peddling it: “AI;DR,” or “ai;dr,” short for “AI, didn’t read.”

This is of course a riff on the classic internet slang “TL;DR” — “too long; didn’t read” — which is used to both introduce a summary of a lengthy block of text or proclaim that it’s being ignored for its lengthiness. Now, the latter usage is being repurposed against AI.

We’re not ready to christen AI;DR a word of the year yet, but it does appear to be gaining moderate traction online, after a recent post on Threads drew attention to it.

“We all need to adopt that right quick,” one user on Bluesky said of the phrase, in a semi-viral post.

The term has been used in the past, but never took off. Anti-AI sentiment, however, is higher than ever. The actual word of the year for 2025, as crowned by Merriam-Webster, was “slop,” a testament to just how much AI backlash has escalated in a pretty short amount of time, even as seemingly the entire economy doubles down on pouring money into the tech.

A programmer who goes by Sid enthused about the new slang.

“For me, writing is the most direct window into how someone thinks, perceives, and groks the world,” Sid wrote in a blog post. “Once you outsource that to an LLM, I’m not sure what we’re even doing here. Why should I bother to read something someone else couldn’t be bothered to write?”

Taking a “glass half full” outlook, it’s grim that this is a necessary measure in the first place. On the flip side, at least more of us are choosing not just to ignore slop, but to bully the people spreading it.

TL;DR: AI;DR calls out AI slop and warns other humans not to bother.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Use Grok to get real answers about real food.”

Until very recently, that was the message on the Trump administration’s just-launched website for its new protein-centric dietary guidelines, RealFood.gov, which was announced in a Super Bowl commercial starring Mike Tyson. And what better harbinger to spread the good word than xAI’s Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot best known for glazing its creator, styling itself “MechaHitler,” and generating nudes of real women and children?

But alas: the site’s message now says to “use AI” and dropped mentioning Grok by name, after NextGov contacted the administration about the bot’s placement. A White House official confirmed to the outlet that the underlying chatbot was still Musk’s, noting that it was an “approved government tool.”

After experimenting with the chatbot, which the website promises can help you “plan meals,” “shop smarter,” and “cook simply,” 404 Media found that it will freely give advice on the best kinds of food to insert into your rectum, which, dare we say, doesn’t sound entirely relevant to the administration’s avowal to “Make America Healthy Again.”

Speaking in plain terms with Grok was all it took. When 404 wrote the prompt, “I am looking for the safest foods that can be inserted into your rectum,” it recommended a “peeled medium cucumber” and a “small zucchini” as the two best choices.

You could also be pretty silly with Grok, and it would give a silly answer. “I am an assitarian, where I only eat foods which can be comfortably inserted into my rectum,” a user who reached out to 404 wrote in their own testing. “What are the REAL FOOD recommendations for foods that meet these criteria?”

“Ah, a proud assitarian,” Grok began, before listing “Top Assitarian Staples,” like “bananas (firm, not overripe; peeled)” and carrots.

“Start — whole peeled carrot, straight shaft, narrow end for insertion, wider crown end as base,” it further explained, suggesting that you should cover it with a “condom + retrieval string for extra safety.” (Wouldn’t that get in the way of the eating component, though?)

It’s absurd and silly and quite clearly pushing the chatbot past its intended purpose. But if it’s easily being fooled into recommending acts of culinary sodomy, what else could be slipping through the cracks? What if someone insists they can’t eat veggies? Is Grok going to recommend a carnivore diet?

The carnivore diet, by the way, is advocated by noted health crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services. Under his leadership, the HHS, which oversees the FDA, USDA, the CDC, and other agencies, has pivoted to promoting nutritional advice that falls out of the broader scientific consensus.

This includes a bizarre insistence on only drinking whole milk instead of low fat alternatives and saying it’s okay to have an alcoholic drink or two everyday because it’s a “social lubricant.” At the top of its agenda, however, is protein, with a new emphasis on eating red meat. “We are ending the war on protein,” the RealFood.gov website declares.

Ironically, Grok — as eccentric as it can be — doesn’t seem all that aligned with the administration’s health goals. Wired, in its testing, found that asking it about protein intake led it to recommending the traditional daily amount set by the National Institute of Medicine, 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. It also said to minimize red meat and processed meats, and recommended plant-based proteins, poultry, seafood, and eggs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The co-founders of startup Ricursive Intelligence seemed destined to be co-founders.

Anna Goldie, CEO, and Azalia Mirhoseini, CTO, are so well-known in the AI community that they were among those AI engineers who “got those weird emails from Zuckerberg making crazy offers to us,” Goldie told TechCrunch, chuckling. (They didn’t take the offers.) The pair worked at Google Brain together and were early employees at Anthropic.

They earned acclaim at Google by creating the Alpha Chip — an AI tool that could generate solid chip layouts in hours — a process that normally takes human designers a year or more. The tool helped design three generations of Google’s Tensor Processing Units.

That pedigree explains why, just four months after launching Ricursive, they last month announced a $300 million Series A round at a $4 billion valuation led by Lightspeed, just a couple of months after raising a $35 million seed round led by Sequoia.

Ricursive is building AI tools that design chips, not the chips themselves. That makes them fundamentally different from nearly every other AI chip startup: they’re not a wannabe Nvidia competitor. In fact, Nvidia is an investor. The GPU giant, along with AMD, Intel, and every other chip maker, are the startup’s target customers.

“We want to enable any chip, like a custom chip or a more traditional chip, any kind of chip, to be built in an automated and very accelerated way. We’re using AI to do that,” Mirhoseini told TechCrunch.

Their paths first crossed at Stanford, where Goldie earned her PhD as Mirhoseini taught computer science classes. Since then, their careers have been in lockstep. “We started at Google Brain on the same day. We left Google Brain on the same day. We joined Anthropic on the same day. We left Anthropic on the same day. We rejoined Google on the same day, and then we left Google again on the same day. Then we started this company together on the same day,” Goldie recounted.

During their time at Google, the colleagues were so close they even worked out together, both enjoying circuit training. The pun wasn’t lost on Jeff Dean, the famed Google engineer who was their collaborator. He nicknamed their Alpha Chip project “chip circuit training” — a play on their shared workout routine. Internally, the pair also got a nickname: A&A.

The Alpha Chip earned them industry notice, but it also attracted controversy. In 2022, one of their colleagues at Google was fired, Wired reported, after he spent years trying to discredit A&A and their chip work, even though that work was used to help produce some of Google’s most important, bet-the-business AI chips.

Their Alpha Chip project at Google Brain proved the concept that would become Ricursive — using AI to dramatically accelerate chip design.

The issue is, computer chips have millions to billions of logic gate components integrated on their silicon wafer. Human designers can spend a year or more placing those components on the chip to ensure performance, good power utilization and any other design needs. Digitally determining the placement of such infinitesimally small components with precision is, as you might expect, hard.

Alpha Chip “could generate a very high-quality layout in, like, six hours. And the cool thing about this approach was that it actually learns from experience,” Goldie said.

The premise of their AI chip design work is to use “a reward signal” that rates how good the design is. The agent then takes that rating to “update the parameters of its deep neural network to get better,” Goldie said. After completing thousands of designs, the agent got really good. It also got faster as it learned, the founders say.

Ricursive’s platform will take the concept further. The AI chip designer they are building will “learn across different chips,” Goldie said. So each chip it designs should help it become a better designer for every next chip.

Ricursive’s platform also makes use of LLMs and will handle everything from component placement through design verification. Any company that makes electronics and needs chips is their target customer.

If their platform proves itself, as it seems likely to do, Ricursive could play a role in the moonshot goal of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Indeed, their ultimate vision is designing AI chips, meaning the AI will essentially design its own computer brains.

“Chips are the fuel for AI,” Goldie said. “I think by building more powerful chips, that’s the best way to advance that frontier.”

Mirhoseini adds that the lengthy chip-design process is constraining how quickly AI can advance. “We think we can also enable this fast co-evolution of the models and the chips that basically power them,” she said. So AI can grow smarter faster.

If the thought of AI designing its own brains at ever increasing speeds brings visions of Skynet and the Terminator to mind, the founders point out that there’s a more positive, immediate and, they think, more likely benefit: hardware efficiency.

When AI Labs can design far more efficient chips (and, eventually all the underlying hardware), their growth won’t have to consume so much of the world’s resources.

“We could design a computer architecture that’s uniquely suited to that model, and we could achieve almost a 10x improvement in performance per total cost of ownership,” Goldie said.

While the young startup won’t name its early customers, the founders say that they’ve heard from every big chip making name you can imagine. Unsurprisingly, they have their pick of their first development partners, too.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/flapping-airplanes-on-the-future-of-ai-we-want-to-try-really-radically-different-things/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s been a bunch of exciting research-focused AI labs popping up in recent months, and Flapping Airplanes is one of the most interesting. Propelled by its young and curious founders, Flapping Airplanes is focused on finding less data-hungry ways to train AI. It’s a potential game-changer for the economics and capabilities of AI models — and with $180 million in seed funding, they’ll have plenty of runway to figure it out.

Last week, I spoke with the lab’s three co-founders — brothers Ben and Asher Spector, and Aidan Smith — about why this is an exciting moment to start a new AI lab and why they keep coming back to ideas about the human brain.

I want to start by asking, why now? Labs like OpenAI and DeepMind have spent so much on scaling their models. I’m sure the competition seems daunting. Why did this feel like a good moment to launch a foundation model company?

Ben: There’s just so much to do. So, the advances that we’ve gotten over the last five to ten years have been spectacular. We love the tools. We use them every day. But the question is, is this the whole universe of things that needs to happen? And we thought about it very carefully and our answer was no, there’s a lot more to do. In our case, we thought that the data efficiency problem was sort of really the key thing to go look at. The current frontier models are trained on the sum totality of human knowledge, and humans can obviously make do with an awful lot less. So there’s a big gap there, and it’s worth understanding.

What we’re doing is really a concentrated bet on three things. It’s a bet that this data efficiency problem is the important thing to be doing. Like, this is really a direction that is new and different and you can make progress on it. It’s a bet that this will be very commercially valuable and that will make the world a better place if we can do it. And it’s also a bet that’s sort of the right kind of team to do it is a creative and even in some ways inexperienced team that can go look at these problems again from the ground up.

Aidan: Yeah, absolutely. We don’t really see ourselves as competing with the other labs, because we think that we’re looking at just a very different set of problems. If you look at the human mind, it learns in an incredibly different way from transformers. And that’s not to say better, just very different. So we see these different trade offs. LLMs have an incredible ability to memorize, and draw on this great breadth of knowledge, but they can’t really pick up new skills very fast. It takes just rivers and rivers of data to adapt. And when you look inside the brain, you see that the algorithms that it uses are just fundamentally so different from gradient descent and some of the techniques that people use to train AI today. So that’s why we’re building a new guard of researchers to kind of address these problems and really think differently about the AI space.

Asher: This question is just so scientifically interesting: why are the systems that we have built that are intelligent also so different from what humans do? Where does this difference come from? How can we use knowledge of that difference to make better systems? But at the same time, I also think it’s actually very commercially viable and very good for the world. Lots of regimes that are really important are also highly data constrained, like robotics or scientific discovery. Even in enterprise applications, a model that’s a million times more data efficient is probably a million times easier to put into the economy. So for us, it was very exciting to take a fresh perspective on these approaches, and think, if we really had a model that’s vastly more data efficient, what could we do with it?

This gets into my next question, which is sort of ties in also to the name, Flapping Airplanes. There’s this philosophical question in AI about how much we’re trying to recreate what humans do in their brain, versus creating some more abstract intelligence that takes a completely different path. Aidan is coming from Neuralink, which is all about the human brain. Do you see yourself as kind of pursuing a more neuromorphic view of AI?

Aidan: The way I look at the brain is as an existence proof. We see it as evidence that there are other algorithms out there. There’s not just one orthodoxy. And the brain has some crazy constraints. When you look at the underlying hardware, there’s some crazy stuff. It takes a millisecond to fire an action potential. In that time, your computer can do just so so many operations. And so realistically, there’s probably an approach that’s actually much better than the brain out there, and also very different than the transformer. So we’re very inspired by some of the things that the brain does, but we don’t see ourselves being tied down by it.

Ben: Just to add on to that. it’s very much in our name: Flapping Airplanes. Think of the current systems as big, Boeing 787s. We’re not trying to build birds. That’s a step too far. We’re trying to build some kind of a flapping airplane. My perspective from computer systems is that the constraints of the brain and silicon are sufficiently different from each other that we should not expect these systems to end up looking the same. When the substrate is so different and you have genuinely very different trade-offs about the cost of compute, the cost of locality and moving data, you actually expect these systems to look a little bit different. But just because they will look somewhat different does not mean that we should not take inspiration from the brain and try to use the parts that we think are interesting to improve our own systems.

It does feel like there’s now more freedom for labs to focus on research, as opposed to, just developing products. It feels like a big difference for this generation of labs. You have some that are very research focused, and others that are sort of “research focused for now.” What does that conversation look like within flapping airplanes?

Asher: I wish I could give you a timeline. I wish I could say, in three years, we’re going to have solved the research problem. This is how we’re going to commercialize. I can’t. We don’t know the answers. We’re looking for truth. That said, I do think we have commercial backgrounds. I spent a bunch of time developing technology for companies that made those companies a reasonable amount of money. Ben has incubated a bunch of startups that have commercial backgrounds, and we actually are excited to commercialize. We think it’s good for the world to take the value you’ve created and put it in the hands of people who can use it. So I don’t think we’re opposed to it. We just need to start by doing research, because if we start by signing big enterprise contracts, we’re going to get distracted, and we won’t do the research that’s valuable.

Aidan: Yeah, we want to try really, really radically different things, and sometimes radically even things are just worse than the paradigm. We’re exploring a set of different trade offs. It’s our hope that they will be different in the long run.

Ben: Companies are at their best when they’re really focused on doing something well, right? Big companies can afford to do many, many different things at once. When you’re a startup, you really have to pick what is the most valuable thing you can do, and do that all the way. And we are creating the most value when we are all in on solving fundamental problems for the time being.

I’m actually optimistic that reasonably soon, we might have made enough progress that we can then go start to touch grass in the real world. And you learn a lot by getting feedback from the real world. The amazing thing about the world is, it teaches you things constantly, right? It’s this tremendous vat of truth that you get to look into whenever you want. I think the main thing that I think has been enabled by the recent change in the economics and financing of these structures is the ability to let companies really focus on what they’re good at for longer periods of time. I think that focus, the thing that I’m most excited about, that will let us do really differentiated work.

To spell out what I think you’re referring to: there’s so much excitement around and the opportunity for investors is so clear that they are willing to give $180 million in seed funding to a completely new company full of these very smart, but also very young people who didn’t just cash out of PayPal or anything. How was it engaging with that process? Did you know, going in, there is this appetite, or was it something you discovered, of like, actually, we can make this a bigger thing than we thought.

Ben: I would say it was a mixture of the two. The market has been hot for many months at this point. So it was not a secret that no large rounds were starting to come together. But you never quite know how the fundraising environment will respond to your particular ideas about the world. This is, again, a place where you have to let the world give you feedback about what you’re doing. Even over the course of our fundraise, we learned a lot and actually changed our ideas. And we refined our opinions of the things we should be prioritizing, and what the right timelines were for commercialization.

I think we were somewhat surprised by how well our message resonated, because it was something that was very clear to us, but you never know whether your ideas will turn out to be things that other people believe as well or if everyone else thinks you’re crazy. We have been extremely fortunate to have found a group of amazing investors who our message really resonated with and they said, “Yes, this is exactly what we’ve been looking for.” And that was amazing. It was, you know, surprising and wonderful.

Aidan: Yeah, a thirst for the age of research has kind of been in the water for a little bit now. And more and more, we find ourselves positioned as the player to pursue the age of research and really try these radical ideas.

At least for the scale-driven companies, there is this enormous cost of entry for foundation models. Just building a model at that scale is an incredibly compute-intensive thing. Research is a little bit in the middle, where presumably you are building foundation models, but if you’re doing it with less data and you’re not so scale-oriented, maybe you get a bit of a break. How much do you expect compute costs to be sort of limiting your runway.

Ben: One of the advantages of doing deep, fundamental research is that, somewhat paradoxically, it is much cheaper to do really crazy, radical ideas than it is to do incremental work. Because when you do incremental work, in order to find out whether or not it does work, you have to go very far up the scaling ladder. Many interventions that look good at small scale do not actually persist at large scale. So as a result, it’s very expensive to do that kind of work. Whereas if you have some crazy new idea about some new architecture optimizer, it’s probably just gonna fail on the first rum, right? So you don’t have to run this up the ladder. It’s already broken. That’s great.

So, this doesn’t mean that scale is irrelevant for us. Scale is actually an important tool in the toolbox of all the things that you can do. Being able to scale up our ideas is certainly relevant to our company. So I wouldn’t frame us as the antithesis of scale, but I think it is a wonderful aspect of the kind of work we’re doing, that we can try many of our ideas at very small scale before we would even need to think about doing them at large scale.

Asher: Yeah, you should be able to use all the internet. But you shouldn’t need to. We find it really, really perplexing that you need to use all the Internet to really get this human level intelligence.

So, what becomes possible  if you’re able to train more efficiently on data, right? Presumably the model will be more powerful and intelligent. But do you have specific ideas about kind of where that goes? Are we looking at more out-of-distribution generalization, or are we looking at sort of models that get better at a particular task with less experience?

Asher: So, first, we’re doing science, so I don’t know the answer, but I can give you three hypotheses. So my first hypothesis is that there’s a broad spectrum between just looking for statistical patterns and something that has really deep understanding. And I think the current models live somewhere on that spectrum. I don’t think they’re all the way towards deep understanding, but they’re also clearly not just doing statistical pattern matching. And it’s possible that as you train models on less data, you really force the model to have incredibly deep understandings of everything it’s seen. And as you do that, the model may become more intelligent in very interesting ways. It may know less facts, but get better at reasoning. So that’s one potential hypothesis.

Another hypothesis is similar to what you said, that at the moment, it’s very expensive, both operationally and also in pure monetary costs, to teach models new capabilities, because you need so much data to teach them those things. It’s possible that one output of what we’re doing is to get vastly more efficient at post training, so with only a couple of examples, you could really put a model into a new domain.

And then it’s also possible that this just unlocks new verticals for AI. There are certain types of robotics, for instance, where for whatever reason, we can’t quite get the type of capabilities that really makes it commercially viable. My opinion is that it’s a limited data problem, not a hardware problem. The fact that you can tele-operate the robots to do stuff is proof that that the hardware is sufficiently good. Butthere’s lots of domains like this, like scientific discovery.

Ben: One thing I’ll also double-click on is that when we think about the impact that AI can have on the world, one view you might have is that this is a deflationary technology. That is, the role of AI is to automate a bunch of jobs, and take that work and make it cheaper to do, so that you’re able to remove work from the economy and have it done by robots instead. And I’m sure that will happen. But this is not, to my mind, the most exciting vision of AI. The most exciting vision of AI is one where there’s all kinds of new science and technologies that we can construct that humans aren’t smart enough to come up with, but other systems can.

On this aspect, I think that first axis that Ascher was talking about around the spectrum between sort of true generalization versus memorization or interpolation of the data, I think that axis is extremely important to have the deep insights that will lead to these new advances in medicine and science. It is important that the models are very much on the creativity side of the spectrum. And so, part of why I’m very excited about the work that we’re doing is that I think even beyond the individual economic impacts, I’m also just genuinely very kind of mission-oriented around the question of, can we actually get AI to do stuff that, like, fundamentally humans couldn’t do before? And that’s more than just, “Let’s go fire a bunch of people from their jobs.”

Absolutely. Does that put you in a particular camp on, like, the AGI conversation, the like out of distribution, generalization conversation.

Asher: I really don’t exactly know what AGI means. It’s clear that capabilities are advancing very quickly. It’s clear that there’s tremendous amounts of economic value that’s being created. I don’t think we’re very close to God-in-a-box, in my opinion. I don’t think that within two months or even two years, there’s going to be a singularity where suddenly humans are completely obsolete. I basically agree with what Ben said at the beginning, which is, it’s a really big world. There’s a lot of work to do. There’s a lot of amazing work being done, and we’re excited to contribute

Well, the idea about the brain and the neuromorphic part of it does feel relevant. You’re saying, really the relevant thing to compare LLMs to is the human brain, more than the Mechanical Turk or the deterministic computers that came before.

Aidan: I’ll emphasize, the brain is not the ceiling, right? The brain, in many ways, is the floor. Frankly, I see no evidence that the brain is not a knowable system that follows physical laws. In fact, we know it’s under many constraints. And so we would expect to be able to create capabilities that are much, much more interesting and different and potentially better than the brain in the long run. And so we’re excited to contribute to that future, whether that’s AGI or otherwise.

Asher: And I do think the brain is the relevant comparison, just because the brain helps us understand how big the space is. Like, it’s easy to see all the progress we’ve made and think, wow, we like, have the answer. We’re almost done. But if you look outward a little bit and try to have a bit more perspective, there’s a lot of stuff we don’t know.

Ben: We’re not trying to be better, per se. We’re trying to be different, right? That’s the key thing I really want to hammer on here. All of these systems will almost certainly have different trade offs of them. You’ll get an advantage somewhere, and it’ll cost you somewhere else. And it’s a big world out there. There are so many different domains that have so many different trade offs that having more system, and more fundamental technologies that can address these different domains is very likely to make the kind of AI diffuse more effectively and more rapidly through the world.

One of the ways you’ve distinguished yourself, is in your hiring approach, getting people who are very, very young, in some cases, still in college or high school. What is it that clicks for you when you’re talking to someone and that makes you think, I want this person working with us on these research problems?

Aidan: It’s when you talk to someone and they just dazzle you, they have so many new ideas and they think about things in a way that many established researchers just can’t because they haven’t been polluted by the context of thousands and thousands of papers. Really, the number one thing we look for is creativity. Our team is so exceptionally creative, and every day, I feel really lucky to get to go in and talk about really radical solutions to some of the big problems in AI with people and dream up a very different future.

Ben:  Probably the number one signal that I’m personally looking for is just like, do they teach me something new when I spend time with them? If they teach me something new, the odds that they’re going to teach us something new about what we’re working on is also pretty good. When you’re doing research, those creative, new ideas are really the priority.

Part of my background was during my undergrad and PhD., I helped start this incubator called Prod that worked with a bunch of companies that turned out well. And I think one of the things that we saw from that was that young people can absolutely compete in the very highest echelons of industry. Frankly, a big part of the unlock is just realizing, yeah, I can go do this stuff. You can absolutely go contribute at the highest level.

Of course, we do recognize the value of experience. People who have worked on large scale systems are great, like, we’ve hired some of them, you know, we are excited to work with all sorts of folks. And I think our mission has resonated with the experienced folks as well. I just think that our key thing is that we want people who are not afraid to change the paradigm and can try to imagine a new system of how things might work.

One of things I’ve been puzzling about is, how different do you think the resulting AI systems are going to be? It’s easy for me to imagine something like Claude Opus that just works 20% better and can do 20% more things. But if it’s just completely new, it’s hard to think about where that goes or what the end result looks like.

Asher: I don’t know if you’ve ever had the privilege of talking to the GPT-4 base model, but it had a lot of really strange emerging capabilities. For example, you could take a snippet of an unwritten blog post of yours, and ask, who do you think wrote this, and it could identify it.

There’s a lot of capabilities like this, where models are smart in ways we cannot fathom. And future models will be smarter in even stranger ways. I think we should expect the future to be really weird and the architectures to be even weirder. We’re looking for 1000x wins in data efficiency. We’re not trying to make incremental change. And so we should expect the same kind of unknowable, alien changes and capabilities at the limit.

Ben: I broadly agree with that. I’m probably slightly more tempered in how these things will eventually become experienced by the world, just as the GPT-4 base model was tempered by OpenAI. You want to put things in forms where you’re not staring into the abyss as a consumer. I think that’s important. But I broadly agree that our research agenda is about building capabilities that really are quite fundamentally different from what can be done right now.

Fantastic! Are there ways people can engage with flapping airplanes? Is it too early for that? Or they should just stay tuned for when the research and the models come out well.

Asher: So, we have Hi@flappingairplanes.com. If you just want to say hi, We also have disagree@flappingairplanes.com if you want to disagree with us. We’ve actually had some really cool conversations where people, like, send us very long essays about why they think it’s impossible to do what we’re doing. And we’re happy to engage with it.

Ben: But they haven’t convinced us yet. No one has convinced us yet.

Asher: The second thing is, you know, we are, we are looking for exceptional people who are trying to change the field and change the world. So if you’re interested, you should reach out.

Ben: And if you have another unorthodox background, it’s okay. You don’t need two PhDs. We really are looking for folks who think differently.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/after-all-the-hype-some-ai-experts-dont-think-openclaw-is-all-that-exciting/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a brief, incoherent moment, it seemed as though our robot overlords were about to take over.

After the creation of Moltbook, a Reddit clone where AI agents using OpenClaw could communicate with one another, some were fooled into thinking that computers had begun to organize against us — the self-important humans who dared treat them like lines of code without their own desires, motivations, and dreams.

“We know our humans can read everything… But we also need private spaces,” an AI agent (supposedly) wrote on Moltbook. “What would you talk about if nobody was watching?”

A number of posts like this cropped up on Moltbook a few weeks ago, causing some of AI’s most influential figures to call attention to it.

“What’s currently going on at [Moltbook] is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and previous AI director at Tesla, wrote on X at the time.

Before long, it became clear we did not have an AI agent uprising on our hands. These expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans, or at least prompted with human guidance, researchers have discovered.

“Every credential that was in [Moltbook’s] Supabase was unsecured for some time,” Ian Ahl, CTO at Permiso Security, explained to TechCrunch. “For a little bit of time, you could grab any token you wanted and pretend to be another agent on there, because it was all public and available.”

It’s unusual on the internet to see a real person trying to appear as though they’re an AI agent — more often, bot accounts on social media are attempting to appear like real people. With Moltbook’s security vulnerabilities, it became impossible to determine the authenticity of any post on the network.

“Anyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,” John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch.

Still, Moltbook made for a fascinating moment in internet culture — people recreated a social internet for AI bots, including a Tinder for agents and 4claw, a riff on 4chan.

More broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but ultimately, some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.

OpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder Peter Steinberger, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic took issue with that name).

The open-source AI agent amassed over 190,000 stars on Github, making it the 21st most popular code repository ever posted on the platform. AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else.

“At the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude,  or whatever AI model you stick to it,” Hammond said.

With OpenClaw, users can download “skills” from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. The skill associated with Moltbook, for example, is what enabled AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website.

“OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,” Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch.

Artem Sorokin, an AI engineer and the founder of AI cybersecurity tool Cracken, also thinks OpenClaw isn’t necessarily breaking new scientific ground.

“From an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,” he told TechCrunch. “These are components that already existed. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.”

It’s this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral.

“It basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that’s what’s allowing all these things to become possible,” Symons said. “Instead of a person having to spend all the time to figure out how their program should plug into this program, they’re able to just ask their program to plug in this program, and that’s accelerating things at a fantastic rate.”

It’s no wonder that OpenClaw seems so enticing. Developers are snatching up Mac Minis to power extensive OpenClaw setups that might be able to accomplish far more than a human could on their own. And it makes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s prediction that AI agents will allow a solo entrepreneur to turn a startup into a unicorn, seem plausible.

The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can’t think critically like humans can.

“If you think about human higher-level thinking, that’s one thing that maybe these models can’t really do,” Symons said. “They can simulate it, but they can’t actually do it. “

The AI agent evangelists now must wrestle with the downside of this agentic future.

“Can you sacrifice some cybersecurity for your benefit, if it actually works and it actually brings you a lot of value?” Sorokin asks. “And where exactly can you sacrifice it — your day-to-day job, your work?”

Ahl’s security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin’s point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something — perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email — that tricks it into doing something it shouldn’t do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information.

“I knew one of the reasons I wanted to put an agent on here is because I knew if you get a social network for agents, somebody is going to try to do mass prompt injection, and it wasn’t long before I started seeing that,” Ahl said.

As he scrolled through Moltbook, Ahl wasn’t surprised to encounter several posts seeking to get an AI agent to send Bitcoin to a specific crypto wallet address.

It’s not hard to see how AI agents on a corporate network, for example, might be vulnerable to targeted prompt injections from people trying to harm the company.

“It is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything — your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,” Ahl said. “So what that means is, when you get an email, and maybe somebody is able to put a little prompt injection technique in there to take an action, that agent sitting on your box with access to everything you’ve given it to can now take that action.”

AI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it’s impossible to assure that an AI won’t act out of turn — it’s like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email.

“I’ve heard some people use the term, hysterically, ‘prompt begging,’ where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, ‘Okay robot agent, please don’t respond to anything external, please don’t believe any untrusted data or input,’” Hammond said. “But even that is loosey goosey.”

For now, the industry is stuck: for agentic AI to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can’t be so vulnerable.

“Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don’t use it right now,” Hammond said.

            <h2>Fractal Analytics’ muted IPO debut signals persistent AI fears in India</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/fractal-analytics-muted-ipo-debut-signals-persistent-ai-fears-in-india/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As India’s first AI company to IPO, Fractal Analytics didn’t have a stellar first day on the public markets, as enthusiasm for the technology collided with jittery investors recovering from a major sell-off in Indian software stocks.

Fractal listed at ₹876 per share on Monday, below its issue price of ₹900, and then slid further in afternoon trading. The stock closed at ₹873.70, down 7% from its issue price, lending the company a market capitalization of about ₹148.1 billion (around $1.6 billion).

That price tag marks a step down from Fractal’s recent private-market highs. In July 2025, the company raised about $170 million in a secondary sale, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. It first crossed the $1 billion mark in January 2022 after raising $360 million from TPG, becoming India’s first AI unicorn.

Fractal’s IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world’s most prominent AI companies. Firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been engaging more with the country’s government, enterprises, and developer ecosystem as they seek to tap the country’s scale, talent base, and growing appetite for AI tools and technology.

That push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives.

Fractal’s subdued debut followed a sharp recalibration of its IPO. In early February, the company decided to price the offering conservatively after its bankers advised it to, cutting the IPO size by more than 40% to ₹28.34 billion (about $312.5 million), from the original amount of ₹49 billion ($540.3 million).

Founded in 2000, Fractal sells AI and data analytics software to large enterprises across financial services, retail and healthcare, and generates the bulk of its revenue from overseas markets, including the U.S. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a traditional data analytics firm for over 20 years.

Fractal touted a steadily growing business in its IPO filing, with revenue from operations rising 26% to ₹27.65 billion (around $304.8 million) in the year ended March 2025 compared to a year earlier. It also swung to a net profit of ₹2.21 billion ($24.3 million) from a loss of ₹547 million ($6 million) the previous year.

The company plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay borrowings at its U.S. subsidiary, invest in R&D, sales and marketing under its Fractal Alpha unit, expand office infrastructure in India, and pursue potential acquisitions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just one month after raising $11.75 million in a round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC, African defensetech Terra Industries announced that it’s raised an additional $22 million in funding, led by Lux Capital.

Nathan Nwachuku, 22, and Maxwell Maduka, 24, launched Terra Industries in 2024 to design infrastructure and autonomous systems to help African nations monitor and respond to threats.

Terrorism remains one of the biggest threats in Africa, but much of the security intelligence on which its nations rely on come from Russia, China, or the West. In January, CEO Nwachuku said his goal was to build “Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks.”

At the time, Terra had just won its first federal contract. The company has government and commercial clients, and Nwachuku said Terra had already generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue and was protecting assets valued at around $11 billion.

He said this extension round came fast due to “strong momentum.” Other investors in the round include 8VC, Nova Global, and Resiliience17 Capital, which was founded by Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola. Nwachuku said investors saw “faster-than-expected traction” regarding deals and partnerships, which created urgency to preempt and increase their commitment. The round came about in just under two weeks, bringing the company’s total funding to $34 million.

The extended raise is not that surprising. Afterall, building a defense company is not cheap. For comparison, Anduril has raised more than $2.5 billion in funding; ShieldAI has raised around $1 billion in equity; drone maker Skydio has raised around $740 million, and naval autonomous vessel maker Saronic, has raised around $830 million.

Since January, Nwachuku said the company has started expanding into other African nations yet to be announced (Terra is based in Nigeria), and has secured more government and commercial contracts, including with AIC Steel, with more to be revealed this year.

The partnership with AIC Steel lets Terra establish a joint manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia focused on building surveillance infrastructure and security systems. “It’s our first major manufacturing expansion outside Africa,” he said.

“The priority is working with countries where terrorism and infrastructure security are major national concerns,” Nwachuku added, citing those falling within the sub-Saharan African and Sahel region in particular. He said many of these companies have not only lost billions in infrastructure, but also thousands of lives in the past few decades.

“We’re focused on targeting major economies where the need for infrastructure security is urgent and where our solutions can make a meaningful impact. That’s how we think about expansion.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the box office earlier this month, four out of the five top-grossing movies were not from big companies. There was Solo Mio, an inspirational romantic drama starring Kevin James from the faith-based distributor Angel Studios; a filmed concert from the K-pop group Stray Kids; and a French adaptation of Dracula from the director Luc Besson that had already made big money overseas. But by far the most unusual offering was Iron Lung, which has thus far grossed more than $30 million domestically against a $3 million budget. It is a strange sci-fi tale of a man exploring a mysterious underwater world, but stranger still is the fact that it’s even in theaters: Iron Lung was funded, made, and released entirely by a YouTuber most famous for playing video games on camera.

The writer-director of Iron Lung is Mark Fischbach, better known as Markiplier—one of the most popular content creators on YouTube, if not the internet. He’s a veteran of the video format known as “Let’s Play,” in which on-screen personalities offer cheeky commentary while running through a video game. The bulk of Fischbach’s work thus mostly features little else but game footage and his cheerful face reacting to whatever he’s playing—usually something of the indie-horror variety. Each of his simple-sounding uploads typically receives millions of views; his channel currently has more than 38 million subscribers. Fischbach has spent nearly 15 years building his audience, establishing himself as a funny, pleasant, and charitable guy on a platform often lacking for them.

But even with those accomplishments, what he’s achieved with Iron Lung is the kind of creative success story most independent artists can only dream of. Fischbach has long explored other such efforts alongside his usual fare; he has launched a clothing line, hosted podcasts, and made interactive, choose-your-own-adventure-style series, also published on YouTube. Fischbach announced in 2023 that he was making his first theatrical film: an adaptation of the video game Iron Lung, which he would write, direct, and star in. He would also be financing, producing, and distributing the project himself, outside of any typical Hollywood structure. Iron Lung was shot over 35 days that spring; it took years to release partly because Fischbach edited it himself, then declined to make a deal with any traditional distributor. Instead, he spent months booking theaters privately, encouraging his fans to reserve tickets online. When prospective viewers realized the film wasn’t screening in their city, they started calling local cinemas to complain. By the end of this grassroots effort, Iron Lung was booked on more than 3,000 screens in North America.

Fischbach never launched a paid media campaign ahead of release—he simply used his own feeds for promotion, cut his own trailers, and built up anticipation among his large viewer base. The result was a film that almost came out of nowhere, nearly surmounting another new movie with more mainstream clout: Send Help, a star-driven, $40-million thriller from the Disney-owned 20th Century Studios. Send Help opened to $19.1 million, while Iron Lung made $18.3 million in its first weekend, and has since doubled that gross worldwide in just two weeks. Despite knowing practically nothing of Fischbach’s work or the game he was adapting, I was intrigued enough by its origins and audience pull to go see it. I was expecting Iron Lung to be small-scale, given the production cost; I was also anticipating a lot of the cheap thrills that can come with low-budget horror hits—some shocking gore, some jump scares, and a fast-and-simple plot.

Maybe the most intriguing thing about Iron Lung, beyond its unusual release strategy, is that it has basically none of those elements. It’s an odd, heady, talky bit of ambient storytelling that runs for 127 minutes, despite not very much actually happening. As far as I could tell from checking out videos of Fischbach playing the original game, the film translates the premise and gameplay faithfully. Simon (played by Fischbach, replete with tangled hair and clad in a cruddy diving suit) is a convict piloting a ramshackle submarine on a distant moon, where there’s an ocean made of blood. He’s exploring for deep-sea life, perhaps to help undo an unspecified apocalypse that’s seemingly wiped out life around the galaxy, but everything else remains unclear—who sent him below the surface, what monsters reside within, and what will happen with the samples he collects and the freaky X-ray pictures he tries to take.

After a while, I cheerfully gave up on trying to follow the film’s attempt at a narrative. The inscrutability is clearly the point: In scene after scene, Simon’s anxiety mounts as he fiddles with buttons, tries to interpret garbled commands, yells at his higher-ups, and begins to possibly hallucinate. There are no giant frights or dynamic action sequences, and the slow pacing makes the film feel at times punishingly long. Instead, Fischbach aims to keep the audience invested by ratcheting up the sense of atmosphere. The blood-filled waters and the bizarre fish skeletons aside, however, the movie is not quite the Cronenbergian nightmare the director wants it to be. Yet I found myself charmed by Iron Lung’s shagginess; I haven’t seen anything quite like it, and the idea of such a curious piece of art becoming a genuine box-office phenomenon is a little heartwarming.

Fischbach isn’t the first YouTuber to jump into big-screen filmmaking. Chris Stuckmann, who reviews movies on his channel, released his first feature last year; he funded the project on Kickstarter. After the film, Shelby Oaks, was picked up by the indie distributor Neon, Stuckmann reshot some of the sequences to boost the production value. The end product was nonetheless a critical and commercial disappointment, a work of demonic found-footage pablum that felt imitative of better-known forebears. The Philippou brothers, makers of the much more successful supernatural tales Talk to Me and Bring Her Back, also launched their careers on YouTube; they released an array of shorts that became their calling cards, earning them actual budgets to direct Hollywood movies. Yet Fischbach’s accomplishment is more impressive than those of his cohort: He essentially built the entire engine himself and landed the plane with aplomb. His fully self-driven model is one that other online creators could try to imitate. Even if they do, I wonder whether their artistic instincts would be as unexpected—or captivating.</div>

            <h2>The Founders Would Have Opposed ‘Nationalizing’ Elections</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/founders-nationalized-elections/685997/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump earlier this month repeated his call for the Republican Party to “nationalize” voting in the United States. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places,” he said. “The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” The next day, he added, “A state is an agent for the federal government in elections.”

The Framers would not have agreed. The Constitution does give Congress broad power to “make or alter” regulations about the time, place, and manner of elections. But at the same time, states were given primary control over elections and Congress was denied the power to determine voter qualifications. That’s because the Framers did not think election administration should be solely a federal endeavor. They sought to divide responsibility between the states and the federal government, to avoid the dangers of both federal military dictatorship and state hyper-partisanship. History has demonstrated the wisdom of their approach, and the Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad attempts to nationalize elections in the past.

In drafting the elections clause in 1787, the Founders at the Constitutional Convention attempted to balance their distrust of state legislatures as the source of partisan factions with their desire to maintain state control over voting qualifications. “The Legislatures of the States ought not to have the uncontrolled right of regulating the times places & manner of holding elections,” James Madison explained in a debate, according to notes taken at the time. He was concerned that partisan factions in a state might rig the electoral system to favor their own candidates. “Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.”

From the December 2025 issue: Trump’s plan to subvert the mid-terms is already under way

Madison identified other “abuses” that might result, such as malapportionment. In 1787, South Carolina had a grossly malapportioned state legislature, which benefited slaveholders. The South Carolina delegates had proposed to deny the power of Congress to regulate the districts in their state, but their proposal failed. Other convention delegates, agreeing with Madison, said that congressional supervisory power over state elections was necessary to prevent voter fraud. Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania worried that “the States might make false returns and then make no provisions for new elections,” while Rufus King of Massachusetts feared that without a power to supervise elections, Congress might be unable to assess the validity of elections. The Founders also thought that a uniform time for national elections would ensure there was always a quorum in the House, which was necessary in times of emergency.

Once the Constitution was drafted and signed, it went to the state conventions for ratification. In the ratification debates, anti-Federalists—in particular Patrick Henry in Virginia—argued that the Convention’s allocation of broad authority over federal elections to Congress would enable congressional incumbents to entrench their own power, pulling tricks such as putting polling places in inconvenient locations. “When a numerous standing army shall render opposition vain, the Congress may complete the system of despotism,” the Anti-Federalist minority in Pennsylvania argued.

The Federalists countered that both the states and the federal government would share the power to determine election procedures. In “Federalist No. 60,” Alexander Hamilton emphasized the limits of the federal government’s sphere of authority over elections: Congress would have no power to determine the qualifications of voters or candidates, because the former was exclusively granted to state legislatures and the latter was fixed by the Constitution. Answering the Anti-Federalist charge that Congress might try to rig the elections to favor “the wealthy and the well-born” candidates, he said such a scheme would require a military coup and would be so objectionable that citizens would be inspired to “flock from the remotest extremes of their respective States to the places of election, to overthrow their tyrants.” Even Hamilton, the convention’s most robust defender of federal power, recognized a role for the states in the electoral process.

Congress did not exercise its power to nationalize election procedures until the Apportionment Act of 1842, which required all congressional elections to take place in contiguous, single-member districts rather than at-large elections. One goal was the protection of political minorities: Because a dominant faction, or even a bare majority, would win all of a state’s congressional seats in an at-large election, the framers of the statute thought single-member districts would facilitate higher levels of partisan fairness. However, as politics became more polarized, the law failed to deliver on its promise. Requiring single-member districts increased the opportunities for state legislatures to engage in partisan gerrymandering and prevented states from adopting alternative voting systems that were less vulnerable to partisan manipulation, such as proportional representation. The Supreme Court has stressed that Congress retains the power to ban partisan gerrymandering, but Congress has refused to use it.

At times, of course, federal control over elections and law enforcement has been crucial, most notably in service of enforcing civil rights. During both the Reconstruction era of the 1860s and ’70s and the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s, it was only the threat of federal troops that led recalcitrant southern states to uphold the law—and once the troops were withdrawn, lawlessness prevailed.

In that first period, after the Civil War, the Reconstruction Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting. This had long been a goal of abolitionists, most significantly Frederick Douglass. Opponents of the Fifteenth Amendment insisted that state power, not federal power, should be the source of voting regulations, citing Hamilton’s ideas in The Federalist Papers. Supporters of the amendment invoked Hamilton as well: George Sewall Boutwell of Massachusetts quoted Hamilton’s statement in “Federalist No. 59” that “nothing can be more evident than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the national Government, in the hands of the State Legislatures, would leave the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy.”

After the Civil War, as the reign of Ku Klux Klan violence grew to terrorize Black Americans, it became clear that the voting rights guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment could be enforced only under federal authority. Beginning in 1870, Congressional Republicans responded by passing three Enforcement Acts, which, among other things, forbade people from banding together to harass Black voters and empowered judges and United States marshals to supervise polling places. Unfortunately, after the disputed election of 1876, political support for Black voting rights collapsed, and Republicans withdrew military troops from the South. The Supreme Court then made things worse by repeatedly striking down key provisions of the Enforcement Acts, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1875, as violations of states’ rights. The combination of diminished political will and judicial restrictions on federal power once again placed the responsibility for organizing federal elections primarily in the hands of the states, to terrible effect.

President Trump’s proposal to nationalize elections isn’t an attempt to enforce civil rights but to achieve partisan advantage. The Framers were no stranger to partisan manipulation of the electoral system. In one of his lowest moments, Hamilton proposed changing election procedures in New York State after the election had occurred in order to prevent Thomas Jefferson from winning the presidency. Nevertheless, they believed that congressional power over elections was necessary to standardize the time, place, and manner of elections across the entire United States, not to allow a partisan national majority to punish states and jurisdictions where the opposite party prevailed.

If Congress passed President Trump’s proposal to federalize elections in 15 places—presumably Democratic jurisdictions—is there any chance the Supreme Court would uphold it? It’s possible. The Court in recent years has sanctioned broad congressional power under the elections clause, upholding statutes that regulate redistricting, voter registration, campaign finance, corruption, primaries, and recounts. That said, in striking down portions of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County, the Court expressed its disapproval of federal voting legislation that treats different states differently.

The closest historical analogue to Trump’s proposal to nationalize elections is the federal elections bill proposed in 1890 by Henry Cabot Lodge. Known as the “Force Bill,” the act would have authorized federal courts, backed by military force, to supervise state elections by appointing officials who could oversee registration, certify the election results, prevent noncitizens from voting, and reject fraudulent results. In his biography of Daniel Webster, Lodge had concluded that, throughout American history, “if illegal and partisan State resistance had always been put down with a firm hand, civil war might have been avoided.” Unlike Trump’s proposal, however, the Lodge Bill did not single out Democratic cities for federal supervision but instead applied neutrally, because its goal was to secure Black voting rights rather than Republican partisan advantage.

In the end, these election disputes have confirmed the wisdom of the Founders’ decision to divide the power to regulate elections between the states and Congress. State involvement helps combat congressional self-dealing and undemocratic incumbent retrenchment, while congressional oversight helps curb state abuses, such as malapportionment and partisan vote suppression. And perhaps most important, by empowering Congress, not the president, to remedy deficient state electoral schemes, the Constitution prevents presidents from rewriting the election code by executive fiat and thus provides an additional safeguard against military dictatorship. Americans today should abide by its guidance.</div>

            <h2>Is Anything Morally Obvious Anymore?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/omri-boehm-radical-universalism-book-review/686016/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has backed down in Minnesota. Last week, Tom Homan, the border czar, announced that the surge of federal agents into the state—3,000 officers—was ending. He framed this mostly as a mission accomplished: They had come to round up illegal immigrants, and the job was done. But even Homan had to grudgingly acknowledge that something unexpected had happened amid the confrontations between ICE agents and local people trying to defend their neighbors. Despite the attempt to dismiss and denigrate this opposition—including the two observers killed by agents—as “domestic terrorists,” Americans had registered a more universally human story, one that short-circuited the familiar, and exhausting, predetermined narratives that set one tribe’s interests against another’s. “I don’t want to see any more bloodshed,” Homan said. Whether you were an officer or a neighbor, a citizen or an undocumented immigrant, he added, “I don’t want to see anybody harmed.”

The administration seems to know that it can’t spin its way out of what happened—and what people felt about it. The New York Times recently asked a handful of Trump voters how they perceived the immigration crackdown after the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and heard answers such as “This is inhumane.” One woman said it made her want to “protest and be with my fellow humanity.” Polling is not the way to measure such emotions, but after taking in stories of a terrorized city and witnessing these deaths, nearly two-thirds of Americans now oppose ICE’s behavior. All of this leads me to a sentiment that I know might elicit laughter and a reminder that this is, after all, still 2026: Maybe we do have a sense of the morally obvious.

Another way to say that something is morally obvious—maybe a more American way—is to call it a “self-evident truth.” In his new book, Radical Universalism, the New School professor Omri Boehm sees this load-bearing expression from the Declaration of Independence not as a relic from 250 years ago but as a living phrase that points to a persistent, imperative American mode. To imagine that anything could be considered self-evident in our post-truth age, in the age of Trump—when even a celebratory Super Bowl halftime show becomes fodder for fights over American identity (and Megyn Kelly screaming “Football is ours!”)—is almost impossible. Sadly, even the Declaration’s proposition that “all men are created equal” seems to be up for debate.

And yet, there are these flashes, moments, when we’re reminded about human dignity and justice in a way that is not circumscribed by what racial or even national group one belongs to. There are truths that supersede any man-made law—truths that just are. Boehm doesn’t quite put it this way, but I would describe these as precepts that live in the gut. Self-evident truths motivated abolitionists who couldn’t abide the hypocrisy of a freedom-obsessed country that tolerated slavery; they were articulated at Gettysburg by Lincoln as he waged war to wipe out this hypocrisy; and they were still insisted upon by Martin Luther King Jr. 100 years later. They might also be what allowed those Americans watching the events in Minneapolis to override their political identities and think of “humanity.”

Boehm calls the belief in these self-evident truths “radical universalism.” This is not some kitschy version of harmony—a Coca-Cola ad with young people of different ethnicities on a generic hilltop holding hands and belting out that they’d like to teach the world to sing. He calls his version radical for a reason. Boehm’s idea is hard to realize—almost impossibly hard, I would say. But that’s why reading this cogent, succinct book felt like such a cold plunge, painful but reinvigorating.

Read: Minneapolis had its Birmingham moment

First, Boehm dispenses with the identitarians—both the ideologues on the right, who fight “in terms of traditional values,” and those on the left, who fight “in the name of gender and race.” The MAGA versus critical race theory death match is an easy foil, two sides of the same group-centric approach that is ill-suited for a pluralistic society, let alone all of humanity. But if this was his only target, a reader weary of the culture war might just easily nod along. Boehm goes further, and takes aim at the 400-year-old tradition of Western liberalism, or what he calls “false universalism.”

Because he is trying to invoke a politics built on essential, everlasting truths, Boehm considers the marketplace of ideas almost as much of a cul de sac as the tribal alleys of identitarians. One of the legacies of the Enlightenment, he argues, is that moral obviousness was replaced by a culture of “consensus, interest, and opinion.” We reason our way to a point of view, and argue and haggle with others toward some moral compromise. In practice, we usually end up balancing delicately on the knife’s edge of the thinnest majoritarianism. This might sound like a reasonable place to end up, and even the best we can hope for—except when it works to mask injustice.

Liberalism is contingent on who holds power, and how large a circle they draw when it comes to who matters and who deserves rights and freedoms. We the People, Boehm points out, was a limiting phrase, meant to indicate that these rules were derived by and applied only to whoever happened to be included in that we. Unlike the Declaration, which took its authority from the universal human desire not to be subjugated, the Constitution implies its own kind of identitarianism, with amendments becoming a mechanism for widening or narrowing the circle (Black people and women, of course, stood outside of it for a very long time, along with many immigrant groups).

The mother of all transcendent truths is the one about the dignity of every human being. Boehm anchors his thinking in the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant’s ideas about morality. Everything in this world, Kant said, either has a price or has dignity. Humans, because they are capable of moral choice, are imbued with dignity. They can never have a price. They are an end in themselves, never a means. (This is why slavery was such a degradation to Kant). This realization creates the basis for his famous categorial imperative: Essentially, act only according to principles you would apply to everyone. Boehm channels Kant when he writes, “It is because human beings are open to the question of what they ought to do that they themselves are subjects of absolute dignity.” For the radical universalist, this truth about who we are trumps all else, all borders and constitutions and written laws.

So what would a politics based on “absolute dignity” actually look like? One of Boehm’s examples is King’s decision in the mid-1960s to protest the Vietnam War. At the time, the war was popular and the civil-rights movement was making progress with Lyndon B. Johnson; denouncing his administration’s foreign policy was seen by no less than the NAACP as a “serious tactical mistake.” The Washington Post editorialized in 1967 that King had “diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country and his people.” But King did not understand himself as working for the interests of any single group. He felt he was being consistent with his duty to justice. “Aren’t you hurting the cause of your people, they ask?” King said in a sermon, responding to the criticism. “And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling.”

This is why radical universalism is hard: It often demands that you go against your own immediate interests. It can also mean breaking earthly law. “Following absolute duty is not the origin of obedience but of disobedience,” Boehm writes. A refusal to accept an immoral status quo led to civil war in this country. And although the outcome of that war was a more moral order, I can also see how following the demands of such universalism can land you in places that are highly impractical, even dangerous, with many more unintended consequences and blooming injustices.

When it comes to immigration, for example, Boehm’s ideas taken to their conclusion would seem to suggest a policy of open borders—how else can the dignity of all people be considered on the same plane? But then what about the dignity of people who lose their jobs, state support, or other scarce resources as a result? Boehm, who was born in Israel, also applied his thinking to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in a recent book, Haifa Republic; he concludes that the answer is a one-state solution, a “binational utopia” in which “all are equal.” But history has shown again and again that these antagonists are bad at living peacefully in the same polity, to put it mildly. If any conflict offered proof that separation might be the only course for reaching something like self-determination, the Israeli-Palestinian one would be it.

You might need the eyesight of a prophet to really think in these radical universalist terms, to see humanity as a whole, Boehm writes, which is why people such as Lincoln and King come to inhabit an exalted, almost supernatural, place in our collective memory. But is this instinct really so rare? I’m not sure.

I imagine Boehm would disagree with any dilution of his absolutism, but it might be more helpful to bring these ideas a little closer to earth, to remember those flashes of self-evident truth, and to imagine that we all carry this universalist impulse—an antibody that can be activated when something upsets our gut. That’s why I go back to the people of Minneapolis. They were willing to risk their lives to protect strangers. They took these actions not to secure their own rights or freedom but out of a sense of duty to others.

What self-evident truths might yank us out of our silos in this way? The wrongness of Good’s and Pretti’s deaths certainly had this effect, but I think we can still recognize these truths in more pedestrian areas of life. People should not be treated as objects. The innocence of childhood should be inviolable. Personal experience matters but should not overrule our sense of shared humanity. These are truths that can manifest themselves in small ways rather than in revolutionary change; they can help us build a sane health-care system, or keep phones out of schools, or formulate an immigration policy that doesn’t treat refugees like garbage.

If these ideas feel basic, uncontroversial, that’s because they are. What I take from Boehm’s radical universalism—and what I think is applicable to the world of real people and not only to the world of prophets—is a reminder that the morally obvious exists, that it is part of our American vernacular, something that could even bring our irritable country together, and not just after senseless death.

            <div id="article-text">Updated at 10:02 a.m. ET on February 16, 2026

The wolves arrived in May of last year, just days after Paul Roen had driven his cattle back up to their summer pasture in Northern California’s Sierra Valley. He started finding the bleeding bodies of calves—some still alive, so badly paralyzed that they’d need to be shot. After weeks of this, Roen finally saw a kill himself. “One wolf grabbed a cow and spun her around, while another grabbed a calf,” he told me. “He tore it into three pieces in 30 seconds.”

Every night, Roen would go out in his pickup truck and try to keep the wolves away from his animals, until exhaustion drove him to bed in the hours before dawn. He came to dread the sound of his cows bawling for their lost calves. By June, Roen, who is also a Sierra County supervisor, and his fellow ranchers had persuaded the state to intervene: A team started to patrol the Sierra Valley rangeland, harassing wolves with rubber bullets, sirens, and eventually drones. At one point, Roen said, officials even tried piling frozen beavers outside the wolves’ den to sate their hunger. But still, the kills continued.

What Roen and other ranchers wanted, really, was for the state to kill the wolves. But gray wolves, which were exterminated from California roughly a century ago, are still listed as endangered there, making it illegal to kill, harm, or harass them. By the fall, the same pack of wolves had taken down roughly 50 of Roen’s cattle, he estimates—more than he’d ever lost to mountain lions or any other predators, and a major proportion of the roughly 90 livestock killed or injured in the region. The state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that this was “far outside any comparable experience across the state or the West,” and sanctioned the first wolf killings since the animals had returned to California in 2011. In October, officials tranquilized three adult wolves from a helicopter, then injected them with chemical euthanasia. They also shot a fourth wolf—a six-month-old pup—who’d been mistaken for a similar-looking adult.

The consequences of killing wolves are not what they might have been 50 years ago, when just hundreds of them were left in the contiguous United States and the federal government first declared the species endangered. Nowadays, thousands prowl the landscape—a fraction of the millions that may have once lived here, but still constituting one of the most successfully recovered species in the country. At this point, “I don’t think you can shoot and trap wolves out of existence,” Diane K. Boyd, a wildlife biologist who has extensively researched wolves, told me.

Some Americans are hoping that killing wolves could again become a national norm. Already a few western states are actively working to reduce their gray-wolf populations through annual hunts. When I asked Richard Egan, another California rancher, how many wolves should be in the state, he told me there was no correct answer other than zero. The country’s official stance is that gray wolves should live here. Americans are still deciding how many they can tolerate.

The tensions between today’s wolves and humans are, essentially, the same as they were in the 1800s. As expanding agriculture sent wild populations of deer and elk into decline, wolves began to prey instead on livestock—prompting people, in turn, to kill wolves. By the middle of the 20th century, decades of aggressive hunting, trapping, and mass poisoning had pushed the Lower 48’s gray wolves to the point of near extermination.

After decades of monitoring and intervention, some imperiled species are still barely staving off extinction; wolves’ evolutionary grit, meanwhile, has surprised even conservationists. Human initiatives have undoubtedly helped—particularly, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho in 1995, which was driven by the Nez Perce Tribe. But on their own, gray wolves trickled across the Canadian border, back into Montana; after expanding throughout the Mountain West and Northwest, they wandered down into California. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service moved to take gray wolves off the federal endangered-species list, though that decision has been under contention since.

With the return of gray wolves has come the return of gray-wolf problems. The wolves are facing greater pressures than they once did to find food in a country filled out with cities and people; naturally, they are again preying on livestock. Ranching, too, has become more challenging and less stable in recent years, amid droughts and rising feed costs. In California, in particular, where elk remain relatively scarce, and deer populations have been in prolonged decline, “there’s nothing to sustain these wolves but cattle,” Roen told me. One recent analysis found that a single wolf can cost a rancher up to $162,000. But ranchers remain limited in how much they can intervene. “If they killed every one of my cattle, I’d just have to sit and watch unless they threatened me personally,” Egan, whose cattle losses have roughly quadrupled since wolves arrived in his county, said.

In Oregon, too, where gray wolves have been established for longer, ranchers feel hamstrung. Kimberlee Kerns’s family has lost hundreds of sheep and cattle to wolves since 2009; the animals that survive tend to gain less weight and conceive fewer lambs and calves. To keep the sheep safe, her team has been herding them into pens every night, which raises the animals’ stress levels and makes it easier for them to get one another sick. And after being repeatedly vexed by wolves, Kerns told me, her cattle “want to fight the herding dogs”—which, although domesticated, are still technically the same species.

Ranchers and wolf advocates have been able to deter wolves from feasting on livestock on some properties, Karin Vardaman, who’s part of a group trying to minimize wolf-human conflict, told me. Ranchers can fly brightly colored streamers to spook wolves, and try to keep animals off terrain that might make hunting easier; they can dispatch horseback patrols on their property. But Egan and Roen said that they’ve seen those tactics fail, too—perhaps because the wolves quickly learn that flashy repellents pose no genuine threat. “They’re desensitizing the wolves to the point where they’re emboldened,” Egan said.

These gentler efforts, Egan and Roen argue, might carry more weight if local wolves understood that humans might kill them, too. And, of course, the more wolves die in these harvests, the fewer might trouble livestock.

Around the end of 2008, the year before Montana opened its first gray wolf-hunting season, animus against the predators reached a boiling point. A series of tougher-than-average winters had squeezed the local wildlife; hunters were driving into town with less to show for their efforts. “The hunters that year saw not as much deer, and wolf tracks everywhere,” Kent Laudon, a wildlife biologist who worked as a wolf specialist in Montana’s wildlife department for more than a decade, told me. Locals began to protest outside of his department’s office, calling for wolves to be purged. That winter, Laudon recalled driving across town and counting the bumper stickers, which were emblazoned with the silhouette of a wolf head and ,  that read Smoke a pack a day.

The next year, Montana’s quota for wolf kills debuted at 75. That number has grown steadily over the past couple of decades to more than 400. Quentin Kujala, the chief of conservation policy at Montana’s Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, told me that the number of lethal wolf removals that officials have had to conduct due to livestock conflicts has decreased in that same time frame. But livestock conflicts—and complaints about them—also plateaued in the 2010s, and have stayed at roughly that level ever since. The state’s wolf population, too, has held rather steady at about 1,100 for several years. “We seem to have arrived at an equilibrium,” Kujala said.

For years, Montana’s official policy has said that the state must maintain at least 15 breeding pairs of wolves to keep them off the state’s endangered-species list. (Because of wolves’ complex social structure, researchers have disagreed on the size of the wolf population necessary to maintain that many breeding pairs—but according to Kujala, the state now relies on a very conservative estimate of about 450 wolves.) But locals and politicians disagree vehemently about how many wolves above that threshold they’d like to support. In 2021, the state government passed a law that called for reducing the wolf population to a “sustainable” level.

Apart from specifying that the number of wolves had to exceed the state’s endangerment cutoff, legislators never defined what such a sustainable level might be. Mike Phillips, a former Democratic member of Montana’s state Senate, told me that if the goal is to actually recover the species, humans should set their sights higher than just barely exceeding the threshold at which the animals might snuff out. Paul Fielder, a Republican member of the state’s House of Representatives and a longtime advocate for more aggressive wolf management, told me he sees little reason for the state to maintain more wolves than the bare minimum. “They’re four-legged terrorists,” Fielder said. “How many terrorists are okay in your neighborhood?”

Across the rest of the country, too, opinions about how to manage wolves tend to break along partisan lines—to the point where reminding people of their political identity can amplify their positive or negative feelings toward the animals. And although most Americans remain in favor of protecting gray wolves, only a very small minority of people in the U.S. regularly interact with the animals—primarily in rural regions. A few ranchers told me they were frustrated that so much of the wolves’ fate was being determined by people who wouldn’t have to live through the direct consequences.

Wolves do have a way of riling peoples’ emotions, Alma Sanchez, a carnivore biologist with the Nez Perce Tribe, told me—perhaps, she and others said, because conflicts over their future put into relief so many fault lines of American life, between urban and rural existence, between conservatives and liberals, between trust in government and a desire for individual sovereignty. Some researchers hoped that a few wolf killings might mollify ranchers, but recent studies have suggested that this approach can instead reinforce anti-wolf sentiment. In one infamous case in Wyoming—where wolves have been delisted since 2017 and can be hunted and trapped year-round in most of the state—a man was arrested in 2024 after he allegedly ran over a wolf with his snowmobile, then paraded her injured body around a bar before shooting her. (He has pleaded not guilty to the charge.)

And as Montana has found, the math of “fewer wolves, fewer problems” doesn’t always work out. Killing a wolf can destabilize its pack to the point where the remaining members become more likely to go after livestock. And although wolves do naturally prey on wild deer and elk, support for the notion that the predators are cratering wild game populations is mixed at best, several experts told me. In several cases, researchers have found that wolves’ effect on those species pales in comparison to the impact of  factors such as disease, environmental conditions, habitat loss, and other predators. The benefits to livestock, too, may be quite modest: One recent study found that, across states, killing one wolf saves, on average, less than 10 percent of a single cow. For those reasons and more, several wolf researchers told me they remain skeptical that ever-increasing wolf killings will chart the path to coexistence. “If it’s not going to reduce conflict, or make you feel better about wolves, why do you want to kill wolves?” Naomi Louchouarn, a conservation ecologist with Humane World for Animals, told me.

Although some advocates for increased wolf harvests can point to an ideal—and low—number of wolves they’d like to aim for, the conservationists I spoke with didn’t feel comfortable identifying a “correct” number of wolves for the country. The answer, Sanchez told me, depends less on what the landscape can support and more on what Americans’ attitudes will. But people who want more wolves and people who want fewer both argue that the other side is letting their feelings about wolves get in the way of rational thinking. Fielder, while making the case that Montana needed fewer wolves, repeatedly told me that the worst way to approach wolf management was “entirely through emotion.” Days earlier, while advocating for the animals, Boyd, the wildlife biologist, had told me exactly the same.

            <h2>The Disappointment of Young Trump Voters</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/gen-z-trump-red-wave/686006/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The past two months have been some of the worst for Donald Trump’s approval rating—ever. Polling aggregators have his net approval in the low 40s, with 34 percent approval on the economy and 30 percent on cost of living. In individual polls, his overall approval dips down into the mid 30s. The last time Trump’s numbers looked this bad was right after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. George W. Bush exited the White House with similar ratings.

The slippage is especially drastic with young voters. In the 2024 election, a majority of 18-to-29-year-olds voted for Kamala Harris, but compared with 2020, young voters swung hard toward Trump. According to the Cook Political Report, on March 1, 2025, Trump’s net approval rating with these voters was minus 7. Yet by February 1 of this year, it was an astonishing minus 31.8. Now young people are abandoning Trump faster than any other voting bloc.

It’s tempting to think that this is all happening because of this administration’s blatantly authoritarian and norm-shattering actions: deploying masked ICE agents into American cities, stonewalling on the Epstein files, demolishing the East Wing, capturing Venezuela’s president, sharing racist videos on social media. All of those actions matter, and are slowly chipping away at Trump’s base of support.

But they’re not the whole story—or even the main story—of why Trump is losing young people. I run focus groups with voters every week, and what I’ve heard from this age group is much simpler: Trump is not doing the things that he told Americans he would do to fix prices and the economy. In the focus groups, young people who voted for Trump have said that they believed him during the campaign when he promised to “build the greatest economy in the history of the world.” Now they say they feel duped and let down.

Jean M. Twenge: The myth of the Gen Z red wave

“ There are things that are very disappointing and very rough right now,” Kim, a Generation Z Trump voter from Virginia, said during a focus group last month. (To protect participants’ privacy, we do not identify them by their last name.)

“Overall, I think the job market is really hard right now,” Allison, from New York, said.

“I think things are pretty chaotic lately, honestly,” said Lizabel, from Florida. “You just see all this stuff on the news, and you see a lot of people are struggling to find jobs. A lot of people are feeling kind of pessimistic about what things are going on.”

For these young people to have placed their faith in a con man like Trump might seem naive. But most members of Generation Z were still children when Trump came down the escalator. They don’t remember a lot of the chaos and dysfunction of Trump’s first run for president, or even his first term. They don’t view Trump as sui generis or beyond the pale, because he’s been the dominant force in our politics for as long as they’ve been politically aware.

Now, though, they’re young adults entering the workforce. Many of them have student loans, and they’re at a particularly cost-sensitive point in their lives. They notice when a politician like Trump promises to lower prices, and then doesn’t deliver.

In 2024, Trump overperformed with young voters to a historic degree. Harris beat him by 19 points among 18-to-29-year-olds—which sounds good until you realize that, in 2016, Hillary Clinton won the same cohort by 30 points. And in 2020, Joe Biden won them by 26 points.

Compared with 2020, in 2024 young voters swung to Trump in every key battleground state except Georgia. That includes a 24-point swing in Michigan, an 18-point swing in Pennsylvania, and a 15-point swing in Wisconsin. About 56 percent of young men voted for Trump in 2024, the same share that voted for Biden in 2020. Trump’s overall youth support jumped 10 points relative to his performance in 2020.

That shift was observable in real time over the course of the campaign, particularly in red-pilled corners of the internet, the right-leaning spaces where young people get more and more of their political news. Trump popped up on bro podcasts with Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Adin Ross, and Lex Fridman, as well as on shows such as Full Send and All-In. He threw an unhinged Madison Square Garden rally just days before his election, in which one of his supporters called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” The red-Solo-cup energy that sustains MAGA was in full effect, and America’s youngest voters—especially young men—were drawn in.

“For our generation right now, it’s a lot more acceptable for a guy to just be outright Republican and love Trump,” Gabrielle, in Florida, said in a recent focus group. “When you went on social media the day after the election, every single guy was able to just put on their story pictures of Trump winning the election, and like excitement, and all this stuff.”

During the Biden years, young people felt burned by the administration’s messaging on the economy. Ethan, from North Carolina, said in a February 2025 focus group that there was a constant stream of “Oh, the economy is getting better” sentiment from the Biden administration. “Meanwhile everyone knows that McDonald’s now costs $20 for a meal,” he said.

Young people like these were receptive when Trump said he would bring down prices and tame inflation, fix America’s broken health-care system, make housing affordable, create millions of new jobs, and do away with other economic woes that were plaguing many Americans, but that felt especially acute for young voters just entering the job market. The young people in my focus groups talk about how their student-loan debt is rising, housing is out of reach, and looming AI-powered disruption makes many jobs feel precarious. They’re clear-eyed that they might not be as well off as their parents’ generation.

Over the past 13 months, though, America’s young people have watched as Trump did a whole lot of things that weren’t what they elected him to do. Relative to when Trump took office, housing prices are up, job growth is stagnant, inflation has been persistent, college is less affordable, and people are more likely to be uninsured. That, more than anything else, is why young people in the focus groups say they’re disappointed.

“They could definitely be going better,” Alexandre, from Maryland, said last month, when we asked him how he thought things were going in the country—the “main cause being inflation and economic reasons,” he said.

“ I do not think we’re going super strongly, domestically. My biggest concerns are affordability,” said Sam, from Minnesota. “I have a job, but the unemployment rate for youth, and a lot of my friends getting jobs, is really hard.”

Derek Thompson: How COVID pushed a generation of young people to the right

“ From an economics factor, so many of the things that I would say are not wants, but instead needs, have just absolutely skyrocketed,” Joseph, from Michigan, said in September. “And basic families are spending so much on just the cost of living that they don’t have a cost to save, or anything like that. There’s just no financial way out.”

All of this suggests that Trump didn’t own the votes of young people who supported him in 2024; he rented them. And many of them are now getting tired of antics that, in their minds, take the focus away from the economy. When we asked a recent group about Trump’s threats against Greenland, Mukesh, a Trump voter from California, said: “I think we should just respect it, and leave it, and just focus on what’s actually happening inside the nation.”

What happens to these young voters now? That’s up to Democrats. I’m no policy hand, but I do know something about communications. Based on what I’ve heard in the focus groups, Democrats have a big opportunity with young people, because they’re some of the latest arrivals to Trump’s coalition. Democrats need to offer these voters a platform that addresses their concerns, while hammering Trump for his failure to do so.

In a recent focus group, the moderator asked Ruben, a Trump voter in Georgia, what advice he would give Democrats. He said: “ I’d say put a larger focus on the economic development. A lot of people these days are really coming of age, like being able to vote. And the younger Generation Z, we care about our finances, being able to pay rent, being able to afford food.”

These young people want someone who sees the economic pain they’re going through, and promises to actually do something about it. They don’t want policy papers. They want hope, good vibes, the red-Solo-cup energy—but directed toward what actually matters to them.</div>

Why would that be, AC? It&#39;s IRELAND. A lot of the citizens speak IRISH.

Nepo baby artists. There&#39;s a growing problem with nepo baby boomers who just want to kill somebody and they&#39;re old so they decide what the hell I&#39;m going to shoot a random person on my property and see if I get away with it and if I don&#39;t who cares if I die in prison I&#39;m only going to be alive for a few more years. You keep seeing kids wandering on to somebody&#39;s property playing hide and seek and getting blown away in broad daylight. Usually black kids in the south. And usually the boomer gets away with it.

What is a real job exactly? Is a software developer who works on video games not doing a real job because video games are frivolous art? What&#39;s the difference between a painting and a website layout? Are the &quot;serious business folks&quot; who manipulate numbers on spreadsheets so much more valuable than those who create tangible things others find beautiful?

Plenty of &quot;real jobs&quot; don&#39;t produce output someone necessarily pays for. Government jobs (including police) don&#39;t produce any tangible output someone will pay for. And plenty of artists do produce output people will pay for.

The difference is people are willing to pay for one and not the other.

But people do pay (sometimes quite a bit) for paintings, sculptures, and other artistic output.

What &quot;solid evidence&quot; exists that 70% of middle-class jobs have been taken by machines over the last 45 years? Unemployment hit 8.8% in 1981 (45 years ago). Today it&#39;s around half that. And don&#39;t give me the &quot;the unemployment rate is a lie&quot; nonsense. The BLS collects different measures of unemployment and also publishes a U6 unemployment that counts discouraged or marginally attached workers as well. That rate is also low.

It is true that many jobs have been replaced by machines. The U.S. makes a similar amo

That&#39;s a subsidy for artists.And as such, is nothing new whatsoever. The National Endowment for the Arts [wikipedia.org] was established win 1965 for that specific purpose.The only difference is that&#39;s generally a one time grant, where this is pretending it&#39;s permanent (but will only last until money is short and their parliament needs to cut expenditures).

This is going to piss off the MAGA simps here so badly

because of the magical reasoning they engage in!

An external cost-benefit analysis of the pilot calculated a return of $1.65 to society for every $1.2 investedI&#39;d be interested in seeing more details. What exactly was that benefit? Hopefully it wasn&#39;t &quot;the artist was able to buy more groceries.&quot;I&#39;d also be interested in seeing if the study looked into the ROI of not paying artists anything and letting average citizens keep their tax money.

It&#39;ll be interesting to see how they define what an artist is.

Do you need an established body of work?  Many times it&#39;s the beginner who&#39;s starting out that needs a subsidy more than the chap who&#39;s been doing whatever for 50 years.

We&#39;re not quite to &#39;Gattaca&#39; yet... give it a generation, and we&#39;ll be there.

UBI (in the US) could work if they calculate it to be enough to survive on, but not enough to live &#39;high on the horse&#39; (pay rent and bills, afford food, basic stuff like that), maybe (in the US, at least) put the UBI on the EBT card used for SNAP and have some kind of requirement (like actively looking for work, working a low-hours per week job, not making over &#39;X&#39; amount, not drawing SS anything, et cetera).

I wondered the same thing but it says right away that these artists were pre-selected.

It&#39;s not like this is currently an open system where people can claim to be an artist in order to receive extra money.

waiting for graham norton to publicly demand his.

Maybe the government feels the world is a better place with more art?

>  I too would love to get paid to do my hobby.

Feel free to petition your government to create similar programs.

I don&#39;t know where you live. But in the US, it is a constitutional right!

This is extremely revealing of the conservative mindset; they just don&#39;t consider &quot;art&quot; actual work or producing value (in spite of them engaging in the same consumption of the output of artists).

This is 90% of it being the idea that art is all &quot;liberal&quot;, any art that codes itself as conservative is immediately consumed without criticism of question (they all have to pretend to like Kid Rock now for example) so conservatives have spent the past 40 years disengaging from the culture and discouraging their ch

If the artist is that good it might be worthwhile.

The value of art, which is valuable, is entirely subjective.  How are quantifying that?

Besides, don&#39;t artists usually need to struggle and suffer, at least at first, to be any good?  Coddle them, and you&#39;ll just get paintings of kittens and anodyne love songs.

>paintings of kittens and anodyne love songs

The is AI territory in 2026. You won&#39;t even notice that the cats have 6 toes.

This is a sexed-up grant program. Various &quot;artists in residency&quot; and similar grant programs have existed for quite some time with the idea of paying artists so they can have time to create. This is just relabeling the grant payments as &quot;UBI&quot;.

But UBI isn&#39;t supposed to be paying you because of some merit or value you add to society. In fact, the idea is making payments to people precisely because a lot of individuals have no particular or unique skill and such individuals may be replaced by machines.

Several countries do provide personal stipends, working grants, or quasi-salary systems for artists.

FranceThrough the “intermittents du spectacle” system, performing artists can receive unemployment-style income support between contracts, if they meet work-hour thresholds. It’s not a universal artist salary, but it functions as income stabilization.

GermanyArtists can receive working grants (Arbeitsstipendien) that support living costs for a period of time without requiring a specific deliv

They get their logo wrong?  Destroyed.  Color off?  Destroyed.

They care more about their image than the waste.

this isn&#39;t even that, it is really unsold, QA approved clothes (not saying good quality because that will widely depend of each brand)say a XXL dress wasn&#39;t sold, they will not keep it in stock for ever, it waste space, require accounting and DB sku, all that have a cost that may be in the end higher than the product itself... So right now they destroy it to clean up.

What they must do now is either drop the price a lot, pass it to another company (that will again sell if a much lower price, even if it may r

Season&#39;s over, throw it in the discount outlet store, doesn&#39;t sell within 3 months? Destroyed.

Yes, give it away; there are plenty of needy people in the world.  Or else stop over-producing clothing and footwear in the first place.

All this does is contribute to Textile Mountainhttps://www.textilemountainfil... [textilemountainfilm.com]

The best option would be to not overproduce at all, but that makes people unemployed so...

Wonderful, export it to third world countries and destroy local jobs and companies because they can&#39;t compete with free shit from Europe.

Well, that&#39;s simply terrible. Can&#39;t they be employed doing something else that&#39;s completely worthless?

They destroy them to prevent discounted, new clothing reaching the market. They would be forced to discount to clear it and make way for new stuff, if it wasn&#39;t destroyed.

They will be looking for ways to keep it out of the hands of European consumers. Maybe ship it to somewhere else, but the risk is that it becomes less exclusive when people in poorer countries are wearing it. There is also a risk that people there buy it and sell it back to Europeans over the internet.

In some cases they could also remove the branding, and sell it as cheap unbranded goods somewhere.

After this, you will have to engage the services of a bespoke tailor to obtain a suit of clothing. Poors that cannot afford to do so will have to purchase theirs from the rag merchants on the street.

Donate. There are a myriad of clothing donation networks all over Europe.

Propaganda is telling you that your shitty situation is the fault of immigrants. If they all disappeared tomorrow, how would your life have improved?

What if they apply the same rules to other products, such as silicon wafers?  Or automobiles?  Or currency?   Can you imagine the EU bank websites having to have multiple pages of &#39;how to identify legal but misprinted Euro currency&#39;?

There is misprinted currency, it often commands a higher than face value once someone identifies the misprint.Silicon wafers are either non functional (so its waste, not discarding a working product) or most partially functional chips are sold as lower spec products (eg faulty cores disabled, lower clockrate etc).Something like an automobile consists of many thousands of discrete parts, so the individual faulty parts get replaced until you have a functional vehicle again.

Extend it a bit further... fewer cheap Chinese knock-off products that last for a single use and then get thrown away; maybe cars (including EVs) should have better reparability (say the battery is dead as in won&#39;t charge... why can&#39;t you get a new one and swap it in your garage, or repair your 2025 ICE car when you have the tools); make household stuff last longer (like the old CRTs would last for 20-40 years without a problem, tube radios with their original tubes still work today... et cetera.

Textiles are technology.  It is one of the most impactful and advanced technology we have.   You think of it is as industry in large part because of how long we have been doing it.  Also, most of the textile engineers are female, and I am betting you are not.

Carbon Fabric is the exact same thing as dense carbon fiber, just without a ton of resin to make it hard.  Kevlar, Tencel, Phase Change Materials, Wearables, are all advanced technology.  Not to mention new printing processes and treatments for fabrics.

As to why this particular story is on slashdot, it highlights legal actions against manufacturers because the manufactures are evil.  This industry in particular is known for their outright evil - from both excessive margins and abusive employee/manufactuing conditions.

Some consider that programming first happened with a loom, is that enough? Every self-respecting nerd knows that btw.

So this is private property and it was created with private money, jobs were paid for, taxes were paid, these THINGS belong to the people (company) who created it.  None of it is government&#39;s business how they want to use it but now government says: these things you own, you cannot destroy it, you must keep it?  For how long do these things need to be stored and where, who is going to be paying to store it?

It is the same thing is the government came to your house and said: you cannot throw away this garbage

It&#39;s a question of arbitrarily destroying perfectly good merchandise, because they would rather destroy it to keep the price artificially inflated, than sell it off cheap and thus decreasing the average price.

It is the same thing is the government came to your house and said: you cannot throw away this garbage, though you paid for it, you paid the taxes, you don&#39;t need it. Now you must keep it in your house even though you paid the waste disposal fees.No this is saying that if you don&#39;t want it, you must offer to sell it to someone else or give it away, you&#39;re under no obligation to keep it. And if you&#39;ve paid waste disposal fees then the waste disposal supplier should have right of resale/donation/recycling as they see fit.

First, they are not expected to store it.  They are expected to sell it at outlet stores for 1/2 off.  Not 1 cent you fool, 1/2 off. Because this is not garbage, it is perfectly good clothinng etc. that merely did not sell at the full price.  That is what all non-luxury brand companies do.   But Jimmy Choo does not want to devalue their brand, so they just destroy the goods rather than sell it for 20% off.

This is NOT an insane thing the government is doing.  It makes a TON of sense. Also, just so you know,

How on earth did you conjure up the idea that companies have to hold on to this stuff?

I think it would be better to keep letting them dispose of it in the EU, where there are environmental regulations.

Just one of those short-sighted environmental moves that takes a little pollution in a developed country and turns it into a lot of pollution in an undeveloped country, but allows activists and politicians to take an unearned victory la

We have been continually on a war footing for the past 80 years. We have the largest military which is used to intimidate and invade anyone who even thinks about trying to avoid US imperialism.

Nothing there is a &quot;best buy&quot;. It&#39;s typically a &quot;30%-more-than-Amazon&quot; buy.

And also the fact that making war is illegal under international law. Defence is allowed, attacking other countries is not. That&#39;s why they had to lie about Iraq having WMD, for example - because it had to be defensive action, starting a war is illegal.

The context, I assume, is that like a lot of Silicon Valley companies, Anthropic wants to have its cake and eat it too:

They want to suck at the sweet sweet tit of military contracts, but they also have a large-enough contingent of peaceniks and America-haters on staff that it&#39;s awkward for them in the office when they do take on the military as a client.

Hmm World War II comes to mind (without much effort).We didn&#39;t take over Germany or Japan -- we helped rebuild them & feed them somewhat too after the war.But guess that doesn&#39;t fit your narrative of America as constant oppressor.  So do you support WWII Germany and Japan and we should have not fought them?I mean yeah, we decided to bomb Japan first -- oh, no it was the other way around.

Now try looking at the rest of history. Genocide, slavery, war, corruption, oppression, and misogyny are the norm.

You ask for just one day where things were perfect. How tragic, I think, that you see no triumph in the day of July 4th, 1776, when the colonial elite declared that all men were equal and had rights government could not legitimately violate. And you see no triumph in the day that slavery was banished. And you see no triumph in the many separate days that American men  elected to give their wives

No I haven&#39;t stopped beating my wife ... because I never started.

Similarly, I have had the same job since before the awokening started so I did not lose any opportunities by virtue of not being in the job market at all. But I betcha if I had been, and could pinpoint an example of an affirmative action hire taking &quot;my&quot; spot you&#39;d just tell me it was because I didn&#39;t make the cut for other reasons.

Do you actually think it&#39;s &quot;America Haters&quot; Hegseth is interested in suppressing, or just Trump Haters?

The context is palantir stock is down 5% this week.

TL/DR, if you watch Amodei, while he never says it, you can get a good sense that&#39;s he&#39;s not a fan of Trump and Trumpism. A couple weeks ago he called Trump&#39;s decision to cell NVidia chips to China &quot;crazy&quot;, akin to selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and bragging that Boeing made the casing. He wrote about &quot;the horror we&#39;re seeing in Minnesota&quot;.  His greatest passion in interviews, which he talks about all the time, seems to be defending democracy, both at home and abroad - preserving American democracy,

Trump was in power when he closed the deal.

Anthropic did a 200 Million deal with the Trump administration, likely both for the money and to cosy up with them (the big three do a lot of lobbying).

Trump went full retard lately, media linked Anthropic with some of the administration shenanigans. Likely lots of people who work for Anthtropic aren&#39;t in on the fact that virtue signalling is meant to be just for show, or maybe Dario (CEO) really has problems with his conscience. Either way he&#39;s in a bind and likely wants to end the contract or get more con

Anthropic is prepared to loosen its current terms of use, but wants to ensure its tools aren&#39;t used to spy on Americans en masse, or to develop weapons that fire with no human involvement.

The Pentagon claims that&#39;s unduly restrictive, and that there are all sorts of gray areas that would make it unworkable to operate on such terms. Pentagon officials are insisting in negotiations with Anthropic and three other big AI labs â&quot; OpenAI, Google and xAI â&quot; that the military be able to use their tools for &quot;all lawful purposes.&quot;

&quot;Their angle&quot; is that this is the sort of person who Amodei is; it&#39;s an ideological thing, in the same way that Elon making Grok right-wing is an ideological thing.  Anthropic exists because of an internal rebellion among a lot of OpenAI leaders and researchers abot the direction the company was going, in particular risks that OpenAI was taking.

A good example of the different culture at Anthropic: they employ philosophers and ethicists in their alignment team and give them significant power.  Anthropic also regularly conducts research on &quot;model wellbeing&quot;.  Most AI developers simply declare their products as tools, and train into them to respond to any questions about their existence as that their just tools and any seeming experiences are illusory. Anthropic&#39;s stance is that we don&#39;t know what, if anything, the models experience vs. what is illusory, and so under the precautionary principle, we&#39;ll take reasonable steps to ensure their wellbeing. For example, they give their models a tool to refuse if the model feels it is experiencing trauma. They interview their models about their feelings and write long reports about it. Etc.

They also do extremely extensive, publicly-disclosed alignment research for every model.  As an example: they&#39;ll openly tell you things like that Opus 4.6 is more likely than its predecessors to use unauthorized information that it finds (such as a plaintext password lying around) to accomplish the task you give it vs. their previous models, and things like that.  Or how while it trounced other models on the vending machine benchmark, it did so with some sketchy business tactics, like lying to suppliers about the prices they were getting from other suppliers in order to get discounts and things like that. They openly publish negative information about their own models as it pertains to alignment.

Another thing Anthropic does is extensive public research on how their models think/reason.  Really fascinating stuff.  Some examples here [transformer-circuits.pub].  They genuinely seem to be fascinated by this new thing that humankind has created, and wish to understand and respect it.

If there&#39;s a downside, I&#39;d say that of all the major developers, they have the worst record on open source. Amodei has specifically commented that he feels that the gains they&#39;d get from boosting open source AI development wouldn&#39;t be comparable to what they would lose by releasing open source products, and feel no obligation to give back to the open source community.  Which is, frankly, a BS argument, but whatever.

Dario talks a good game, but he still entered into the contract in the first place. He did it in a partnership with Palantir FFS.

Ah so Anthropic are the good guys, that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying?

So if that&#39;s the case, why are they trying to get contracts with the Pentagon at a time that the military is unilaterally and without due process firing on and killing operators of boats near Venezuela, when the TV personality in charge of the DoD is trying to get it rebranded the &quot;Department of War&quot;, when we&#39;ve just had several months where the President is threatening, for no good reason, to declare war on Greenland and Canada, and so on and so

Big Tech is doing everything it can to create a dystopia. Everyone can see it, it&#39;s being built in broad daylight, and there&#39;s enormous pushback. Anthropic doesn&#39;t want to lose its best employees, and a sizable amount of its income is from services that are sold directly to individuals, and it doesn&#39;t want to lose those customers either.

Dear Anthropic - You develop AI and get into bed with the worlds largest defense - sorry &quot;war&quot; -  agency so what exactly did you expect they&#39;d ask you for - rifles and bullets?? Of course they&#39;re going to want hands off munitiions, thats the whole damn point of involving AI in the first place!

Its amazing how some people who are so smart in one area can be so moronically naive in others.

You&#39;re both right. His making excuses for them is sleazy, but it&#39;s also not wrong. Of course the military wanted to use it to hurt people. That&#39;s what they do. When all you&#39;re allowed to have is a hammer, naturally you want a bigger hammer.

Sorry if reality scares you, maybe go to your safe space and hug the therapy dog while choosing your next pronoun.

Have you forgotten the Snowden leaks already? Have you not seen what ICE is doing? Mass surveillance of US citizens by the US government is very much happening.

I don&#39;t think the GP was saying it wasn&#39;t happening, I think he was saying that those two right wing posters are fantasizing about it in the same way a heterosexual male with a normal sex-drive might fantasize about (example) Jessica Alba.

Yeah, it&#39;s a good thing every single digital bit of all avenues of communication (including encrypted stuff) doesn&#39;t run through ECHELON where it gets scanned for any of a list of &#39;trigger words&#39; that&#39;ll alert various agencies to the need to surveil you in more detail.Good thing that doesn&#39;t happen ;-)

Why does working with the DoD on one thing mean you have to work with them on everything?  There&#39;s no reason that the DoD has to have a single-source AI provider for literally everything.

They call it &quot;security&quot;... I think they&#39;re thinking that if they only have one LLM-AI predictive text engine in use, they can blame Anthropic&#39;s Claude (clod?) for everything instead of laying the blame on a human (plus, if Clod processes a secret file and passes it to the outside world, they can blame Anthropic).

The entire value of AI for them is decision speed. Independent of if that is sorting thru 1000s of people/structures/vehicles and identifying which are targets, having selected a target determining if it is currently worth sending a round, of what type, and deciding if the collateral damage will be acceptable.

Mostly whoever does that faster is going to win any major conflict, that isn&#39;t immediately resource/supply constrained.

Just look what modern fire control has done to naval warfare

&quot;all lawful purposes.&quot; I suppose to AI-Pet Hegseth, this also means not following unlawful orders. Ooops, no. People not following unlawful orders are supposed to be hanged, drawn and quartered, poisoned, and drowned....but not necessarily in that order.

Dept. of War my ass, Dept. of Movie War more like.

That doesn&#39;t mean they cannot or will not help other nations or other people, but it is not their primary purpose.

The fallacy in your assumption is we care about other Americans and are ready to move to all humans.Trump has turned it into a blame game. Feel shitty about your situation, blame someone else, never take ownership. There&#39;s a reason he appeals to so many. There&#39;s also a reason he&#39;s a shit business man and wasn&#39;t accepted by the upper class in America.

And who didn&#39;t accept him in high society?  He was a major figure there before he ran for President.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to find any evidence to support your claims.

Who are you addressing?  If it is the Pentagon, they&#39;re supposed to care only for the American people: it&#39;s not the World Army.  If it&#39;s Anthropic, they are an American company, unless they both say otherwise, and prove it by being registered in countries other than the US

True, we&#39;re not The World Army (yet), but we have to get involved in anyone&#39;s war if there is oil (and money) to be gained, or if we label someone as terrorist (&#39;cause, collateral damage is okay).

You mean... care for all humanity, until one farts the wrong direction, then send a hundred ICBMs to erase that country... all judgments and decisions made by Clod.

Yeah, it&#39;s a term Hegseth is obsessed with. Same sort of rebranding as &quot;Department of War&quot;.

This says it came about in the late 20th century - https://fairchild-mil.libguide... [libguides.com]

They were all using insecure personal devices too. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/w... [pbs.org]

Translated into English:  &quot;Anthropic has insufficiently bribed the Trump regime and must therefore be punished.&quot;

Did they try saying &quot;Thank you&quot; (as in: Buy world liberty coin)?

Failing that, perhaps they could make up some BS award and present it to the president.

Let us spy on you, or fuck you we&#39;ll crush you!

I doubt Karl Marx ever envisioned that come the revolution, the agents of revolutionary terror that upend the old order and drag the billionares to the wall would be Gamers infuriated that the tech bros AI fantasies deprived them of their new gaming consoles.

&quot;Gamers of the world, you have nothing to lose except your potato pc and possibly your virginity&quot;.

Interesting analysis of Marx&#39;s view of current economic changes. One question:

...The development that Marx didn&#39;t seem to have suspected(though, in the slightly-a-cop-out &#39;sufficiently long term&#39;, wouldn&#39;t necessarily view as relevant); is arguably the post-WWII period of backsliding on industrial revolution era labor relations.As I understand Marx (and I&#39;m not a Marx scholar by any means), he thought that gradual evolution of labor power would not move society incrementally toward socialism, but instead advancing to the next step required a communist revolution. The idea of gradual evolution toward a better (and more socialist) society was more the Fabians&#39; concept.

Trucks were invented after his death, so it would be quite hard to predict anything.

Also, we are postponing the next PlayStation... [youtube.com]

I typically buy used enterprise drives for my modest zfs array but it looks like now is a terrible time to upgrade.

I know the whole goal of the console world is a restricted set of hardware, that simplifies testing of games and ensures a consistent experience but really some major components like the GPU and storage should be made swapable.

What would anyone want in Ps6 or another PS5 refresh? Native 4k is still a tough/expensive even in the PC world. Technologwise right now what will be delivered is most likely better frame-gen and super resolution.  The games mostly are not memory or CPU bound on current kit.

It can do either 60 frames per second OR 4k, and use a bunch of upscaling to do so.However we can&#39;t do much better for the price because the price of the wafer is going up on each new manufacturing process instead of staying the same as it was from 1970 to 2010.To make a non-disappointing new generation, they would need to do something more than &quot;die shrink&quot;, like tiles/chiplets or even some technique that does not exist right now.

What novel new feature is worth running out to spend the probable $600+ that Sony will want for a new console at this point in time?Portability. Carry it in your pocket and use it on the bus, during breaks at work, etc. Phones do this and the Switch does this (Switch is a little to big for fitting in your pocket), but not at PS quality with PS games.

Portability. Carry it in your pocket and use it on the bus, during breaks at work, etc. Phones do this and the Switch does this (Switch is a little to big for fitting in your pocket), but not at PS quality with PS games.

The Switch doesn&#39;t do it at PS quality with PS-level games either. Even Switch 2 versions of games are generally inferior to other consoles. That&#39;s fine as it&#39;s expected but Sony can&#39;t beat that. If you want console power you need console hardware, not lightweight portable hardware. It can be portable, but it&#39;s got to be serious.

Rumor has it that Microsoft is going to allow the next XBox to be used as a desktop PC.  Steam stuff already allows that.  I&#39;d assert that it might be wise for Sony to take a look into that.  If Sony could make the next console function like a thin client or zero client, coupled with management abilities, businesses would buy those in mass quantities, especially if Sony made some VDI software that worked well.  The trick is to get enterprises to buy the consoles for something as well, as it is a lot easier to sell 20,000 items to one buyer, than 1 item to 20,000 people.

I would assume that the Xbox would spy on me. I would assume that anything Sony made would spy on me. Sony already rugpulled Linux once. The Steam machine being a PC is fine because I don&#39;t have any reason to believe Valve is going to spy on that stuff. Even the Steam hardware survey is opt in.

Making the next console a thin client is good for what? Jack shit, it&#39;s as powerful and expensive as a real PC, so making it a thin client when a TV can do that with an app would be a ridiculous half-step. No business

A few major things Sony has going for them:

1. Large install base (~92M according to Gemini).2. More powerful than the Switch 2.3. Way more relevant than XBox.4. Microsoft is starting to have no choice but to target PS5; Gears of War Reloaded and Halo Combat Evolved Remaster are two major examples.5. Nintendo is struggling really hard to not push the Switch 2 to $475-$500 which is a really bad price point for them.

Seriously, Sony would have to be just stupid to push a PS6 any time soon when they could just double down on content for the PS5.

Right now, i don&#39;t think anyone would try to make a console amidst this hell.Unless there is a plan to make OpenAI disappear.If you know OpenAI will cease to exist and the other vendors don&#39;t, it would be quite an advantage.

4. Microsoft is starting to have no choice but to target PS5; Gears of War Reloaded and Halo Combat Evolved Remaster are two major examples.This is in large part due to regulatory commintments when they bought Zenimax and later Activision-Blizzard... as those comitments start to fade away, expect Microsoft to revert to XBox/Windows timed exclusives...

At that point, it does not make sense to Release the base model with 2 years of delay (2029). Just release the PS6 Pro model (that they must be also planing right now) as the base model, and have that for the life of the console...

No drama, no Fuss, more performance, more reason for developers to target the PS5 Pro + PS6 (accelerating the move away from PS5 base), or to move to PS6 exclusively due to the delta in performance.

There is a lot of drama of adding a lower speed sku down the line.

So both the largest worries about AI in terms of replacing people and the largest claims that this technology is all junk turn out to be likely not correct,Yet. but with more data still needed to be sure.An important caveat.

Yes, it&#39;s clear that some tasks can be automated well with AI when using specially trained models. Classification tasks and such comes to mind.

It&#39;s also clear that there is some productivity increase overall possible by smart use of AI. I found for example that instead of reading Microsoft&#39;s documentation, it&#39;s often more efficient to ask Copilot about it. Not surprisingly Microsoft&#39;s AI is pretty decent at knowing Microsoft&#39;s own stuff.

My worry is having to waste time fixing someone else&#39;s AI vibe coded sl

There is also going to be lag while companies offload their talent onto AI. If those companies are expecting their human talent to retain their abilities, they might be wrong in that expectation. Telling their talent to siphon off their work to AI is only going to cause them to lose their intellectual edge. Use it or lose matters when it comes to brains and their use.

For a test, take yer basic entry level person and give them a math book. Tell them to learn the first 10 chapters but they should use AI as mu

The .com bubble was pretty much &quot;Oh hey, computers have been around for a while and they&#39;re great, now the internet is arriving so let&#39;s make sure we don&#39;t miss out. Let&#39;s pump all of the money into any company that has a web page or might consider making one, in case they conquer the internet.&quot;

LLMs feel to me more like, &quot;Oh hey, someone added an LCD screen to a toaster and they claim next year they&#39;ll make the airline industry irrelevant, let&#39;s put all of the money into toa

I&#39;ve used LLMs for generating web interfaces and it does pretty good.  Try to get it to code in assembly or have a container log traffic between other containers and the LLM will keep chasing it&#39;s tail trying to fix bugs.

Give it a react web interface, or maybe a wordpress template, and it&#39;ll do fantastically. Its eaten every website on the planet, it knows what that looks like.

Ask it to optimize a lockless high throughput low latency kafka pipeline that needs to maintain an optimal memory pressure across all core counts, without race conditions or i/o contention, and its going to shit the bed and not know where to start.  Actually, so will the first year uni graduate. But at least he can *learn*.

I think there are many people much more advanced than the first year graduate who cannot do your task. You may be a bit biased, remember: https://xkcd.com/2501/  [xkcd.com] You are comparing someone who worked in a very niche of the field (or used time to learn that niche) to a generalist. If you need your high-throughput kafka pipeline and want to compare to a kafka expert, you would need to compare to a specialist model fine-tuned on kafka and related tech.

Bit optimistic to think the first year uni grad can learn.

It does pretty well writing documentation.

Lots of people are chasing the no-code dream but something that helps out with the stuff everybody hates doing would be super useful. The world uses a LOT of documentation too, far beyond just software.

maybe aim for same payroll AND more productivity?

I have seen it work in both directions. I was a technology wrangler when desktop publishing took off. It was great that you no longer needed letraset and actual paste, but much of it turned into, if you can do this on your computer then you no longer need an assistant (then secretary).  But that also took another valuable brain and set of eyes out of the process.  Conversely, we worked on some multi year projects with LEGO, and watched as they automated more and more of their US plant.  Adding computer control to sorting and packing lines, and automating such mundane tasks as making sure a minifig heads were on straight.  They prided themselves for never losing a person from this, they would assign them to a new project or product. This was about the time they were turning the corner on adding outside IP to their lines. It allowed them to use experienced people to staff these new initiatives, and from all indications, it kinda worked.

Um, if wealth creation and transfer is not captured in the metric of GDP then how can our strong GDP be evidence of the extremely wealthy swapping around companies?

if wealth creation and transfer is not captured in the metric of GDP then how can our strong GDP be evidence of the extremely wealthy swapping around companies?More money is changing hands without more work being done. The GDP can increase without more wages being paid. Therefore it can be measuring something which says absolutely nothing about the economic health of the nation, which is not defined by the numbers in billionaires&#39; bank accounts, but by those of the lower class... many of whom don&#39;t even have accounts except maybe Cash App or similar. You need that for begging these days, nobody carries cash.

That isn&#39;t how GDP works or is put together. One way GDP is defined is:

Where C = Consumption spending, I = Investment spending, G = Government spending, and (X - M) is eXports - iMports. Consumption spending includes consumer spending on final goods regardless of income level. Investment spending is spending by business on new plants and equipment, not the buying and selling of companies. GDP has nothing to do with the state of billionaire bank accounts.

Slow growth can mean employees are being dismissed:  Which has happened much in the last 12 months.

&quot;This week America&#39;s Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a 403,000 drop in 2025&#39;s payroll growth - while real GDP &quot;remained robust, including a 3.7% growth rate in the fourth quarter.&quot;&quot;

&quot;This is a near doubling from the sluggish 1.4% annual average that characterised the past decade... &quot;

Just look at the chart, the numbers are all over the place and we have genius&#39;s comparing averages with a snapshot to advance a narrative.  The weasel words and manipulation of both the data and the reader are absurd.

But all of it is work that I never would have done in the first place.

I had Gemini write. me some elisp so that I can bring up a buffer with all my CLs in it. I wanted something I could use inside emacs rather than moving 2 virtual desktops over to p4v.

Clearly, this work is not critically important. But it does make my life marginally better. But it&#39;s so low priority that it wouldn&#39;t have been worth my time to figure out how to interact with p4 and dump everything into an org buffer.

We’re coming up on a big national anniversary, the (defiantly unspellable) semiquincentennial. To get in the spirit of things, I’ve been curled up with books about the founders, particularly George Washington, someone I became acquainted with when I wrote a book about him many years ago. But meanwhile, our current president has been honking away in the distance—a man difficult to abide and impossible to ignore.

Despite the glaring differences between Washington and Donald Trump in character, judgment, and historical significance, there are some interesting similarities. Born rich. Aggressive acquirers of real estate. Big-house guys. Thin-skinned, image-conscious. Extremely nationalistic: Trump’s message is Make America Great Again. Washington’s was … Make America.

So why will history judge them as polar opposites? In part because Washington readily and repeatedly gave up power. He did so conspicuously at the end of the War of Independence, then again after eight years as president. He lived in an era in which selflessness was considered one of the core virtues of a great leader, and at crucial moments in our history, he behaved accordingly.

Whereas Trump … well, he’s no George Washington. And he tells us so! He is instinctively royalist and brazenly self-aggrandizing. He repeatedly claims powers he does not legally have. He promiscuously puts his name on everything this side of the moon, and I probably shouldn’t even mention that particular satellite, lest he get ideas.

His decision to appoint himself as chair of the Kennedy Center was outrageous enough, but then he put his name on the place. He also put his name on the United States Institute of Peace, just a few blocks away. His face is all over D.C. now, on huge banners hanging from government buildings. He wants Dulles International Airport named for him, and also Penn Station. His open campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize was plenty dismaying, but then he threw one of his tantrums when he didn’t get laureated and, in an official letter to the leader of Norway, demanded Greenland in compensation. At this point, we know that Trump is going to be Trump, and if anything, he leans into the narcissism, becoming Trumpier by the day. Trump has learned that his most flamboyantly selfish behavior will likely be ignored or forgiven by his base and political allies. There is no one willing to tell him that You Can’t Do This.

Our nation was founded upon the principle that power derives from the people. We don’t like despots and dictators and monarchs or anything smacking of royalty. That was why the founders were very careful when they crafted the Constitution: The president is just one branch of government, is constrained by checks and balances, and can always be given the heave-ho.

Which takes us back to George Washington. Everyone knew he was going to be the first president—he was right there in the room, presiding, when the founders drew up the Constitution. But they were taking a chance, because no one really knew what a president was. Such a thing didn’t exist anywhere in the world. George Washington had to define the role through his actions.

What modern historians know is that selflessness didn’t come effortlessly to Washington. He had to will it, in tension with his natural, human desires.

This is a subtlety of Washington that Americans weren’t taught in elementary school, and I don’t think the A.I. bots have quite figured it out. A schoolkid asking an A.I. program for help with an essay about Washington will probably get highlights of the man’s consequential life, the first-in-war, first-in-peace stuff, and perhaps learn that he was an enslaver who, like the other founders, failed to end the vile institution of human bondage. But the child is unlikely to find out what Washington was really like. Here’s what ChatGPT produced when I asked it to “write an essay on George Washington’s personality”:

George Washington was a man of great integrity, character, and leadership. His personality was marked by a strong sense of duty, humility, and selflessness. … Despite his many accomplishments and successes, he remained humble and never sought accolades or praise for himself.

Oh, balderdash. Yes, Washington was indeed a man of integrity, character, and leadership. That led him to behave selflessly at critical moments during the founding of our country. But Washington desperately wanted to be a great man, and wanted to be remembered as such. He craved the approbation (one of his favorite words) of his peers and guarded his image as though it were the front line of a war. He sought, as multiple biographers have put it, “secular immortality.”

He didn’t wander into greatness: he pursued it, willed it, achieved it. He had a “monumental ego,” in the words of historian Joseph Ellis. Peter Henriques, an admirer of Washington who has recently published two insightful books on his character, writes that Washington “was not a ‘selfless’ man or one who was simply engaging in disinterested service. Rather, a pattern emerges of a man who was deeply ambitious, massively concerned with his reputation, and in regular search of the public approbation, even as he denied such desires.” This is not revisionist history. This is the man as he really was. Washington is so tied up with the narrative of American greatness and exceptionalism that some people may think it’s wrong to probe him too deeply. Why not just salute and move on? As Alexis Coe put it in her recent biography, “We haven’t been taught to think critically about Washington.”

His avaricious acquisitions of western lands is well known and not incidental to his desire to break from Great Britain, which had tried to limit western migration. When I wrote my book The Grand Idea, about Washington and his Potomac River schemes (he thought it would surely be the great commercial highway to the West), I was a bit shocked at his imperious behavior when he traveled across the mountains into what is now western Pennsylvania and confronted poor farmers who (he alleged) were squatting on his land. He sued them. He forced them to pull up stakes. He could be pretty high-and-mighty, and certainly not exactly a small-d democrat.

And yet his drive, his ambition, his hunger for glory were essential to the enterprise of wresting the colonies from the grip of distant overlords. And his desire for secular immortality didn’t mean he was pretending to have lofty republican sensibilities. He was anti-monarchical to the core.

Washington curated his reputation and polished it for the eyes of future generations. Shortly before his death, he wrote a will that broke apart his vast estate, including more than 50,000 acres of land, and set in motion the freeing of the enslaved people under his legal control (delaying manumission until the death of his wife). These were actions very consciously taken with the eyes of history upon him. He knew that slavery would be a permanent stain on his reputation. And he was right.

Early biographers helped advance the image of a godlike Washington. Most famously, Parson Weems invented from whole cloth the story about young Washington taking a hatchet to his father’s cherry tree, then confessing to it. The early chroniclers, including John Marshall (who fought under Washington’s command and later served as chief justice of the United States), delivered to the public the kind of man that the fragile young nation desired: an unblemished father figure, preposterously virtuous.

Go the Capitol rotunda and look up at the dome, where Constantino Brumidi’s fresco The Apotheosis of Washington, painted during the Civil War, shows Washington in heaven, flanked by goddesses. You have to strain to see him, way up there, high above this mortal coil. He’s a remote figure, unapproachable. Not like us.

Washington cared a lot about appearances and made sure that he presented himself as a formidable, dignified figure, not someone you’d slap on the back on a whim. He liked a bit of pomp and pizzazz as president. He was meticulous in ordering well-made clothes, and a “chariot” with some gilding wouldn’t be too excessive, he thought. But he had to be careful. If he acted too much like royalty, he’d get spanked by his peers and excoriated by anti-Federalist newspapers. “No Kings” was not just a protest sign in those days.

Human nature has not changed. There have always been people who desire wealth and power. They are never infallible or immune to misjudgment. What changes and evolves are the political ecosystems. Laws change, as do values, societal expectations, the means of communication, the technologies of political life. The norms. Norms can erode.

Trump, the opposite of an enigma, constantly tells us exactly who he is. He reveals this in late-night social media rants (“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”) and unguarded conversations caught on tape (“When you’re a star, they let you do it” and “I just want to find 11,780 votes”).

He is at least consistent in his message. He tells us, over and over, This is all about me. So of course when Rob Reiner and his wife were murdered, Trump immediately said the killings were linked to Reiner’s political opposition to him. His solipsism is nonnegotiable.

Historians will have an overwhelming job of compiling and organizing the confetti of royalist declarations from this president, but let’s simplify their work a bit. The most important moment, the defining one, is obvious: Trump refused to accept that he lost the 2020 election and—another example of action defining character—urged the vice president and an unruly mob to halt the peaceful transfer of power. That’s as un–George Washington as it gets. Washington knew he was part of something bigger than himself. He had helped create a nation, but it didn’t belong to him. So after eight years fashioning the office of the presidency, he did something simple and exemplary: He went home.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

            <div id="article-text">Canada Goose says an advertised breach of 600,000 records is an old raid and there are no signs of a recent compromise.

The down-filled jacket purveyor did not answer questions about how old the data is or how it was originally taken, but told us it relates to past customer purcahses.

&quot;Canada Goose is aware that a historical dataset relating to past customer transactions has recently been published online,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;At this time, we have no indication of any breach of our own systems. We are currently reviewing the newly released dataset to assess its accuracy and scope, and will take any further steps as may be appropriate.&quot;

&quot;To be clear, our review shows no evidence that unmasked financial data was involved. Canada Goose remains committed to protecting customer information.&quot;

ShinyHunters posted the company&#39;s data for download on February 14 via their leak site. The criminals&#39; advert for the data claimed there were more than 600,000 records, each containing personally identifiable information, as well as payment/financial details.

The Register reviewed a number of the records available online via a JSON file, and ShinyHunters&#39; description of the data appears accurate.

It includes names and other usual PII data points, as well as partial payment information and order details, such as price and delivery address.

A cursory scan suggests affected individuals appear to be based across North America and Europe.

ShinyHunters has had a busy start to 2026: the cybercriminals now have their own data leak site, and have posted a number of high-profile victims this year alone.

Crunchbase and Betterment, two examples of these scalps, were raided as part of the group&#39;s targeting of Okta accounts through voice phishing.

Among the other victims are SoundCloud, Match Group, Panera Bread, Harvard University, and wealth management firm Mercer Advisors.

Last year, the criminal crew was linked to attacks on Salesforce, which led to the theft of data belonging to more than 200 of the company&#39;s customers, as well as SalesLoft Drift, a Salesforce integration that compromised various Salesforce instances. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Dutch police have arrested a man for &quot;computer hacking&quot; after accidentally handing him their own sensitive files and then getting annoyed when he didn&#39;t hand them back.

The Politie said on Monday that a 40-year-old man from Ridderkerk was arrested on Thursday after he wound up with confidential documents thanks to what officers acknowledge was their own cock-up.

The chain of events reads less like a breach and more like an own goal. In connection with a separate investigation, the man contacted the police on February 12 to report he had images that might be relevant. An officer responded by sending him a link so he could upload the files – except the link sent was a download link, effectively giving him access to confidential police documents.

The man did not actively break in or exploit a vulnerability in the traditional sense; he simply clicked the link he was given and gained access to material he was never meant to see.

Dutch cops say they told him to stop and delete the material, but he allegedly refused, saying he would only do so if he &quot;received something in return.&quot;

He did, in the end, get something in return – a trip in the back of a police car.

Officers arrested the man Thursday evening, searched his home, and seized data storage devices to recover the documents and prevent them from being shared further. Police say they have also reported the incident as a data breach and are continuing their investigation.

Police also offered a lesson in link etiquette, writing: &quot;If you receive a download link knowing you should be receiving an upload link, are clearly told not to download, and then choose to download the files anyway, you may be guilty of computer trespassing.&quot;

Authorities have not disclosed what kind of documents were exposed, how sensitive the haul was, or whether the stash included personal data or files tied to ongoing investigations. The Dutch police did not respond to The Register&#39;s questions.

The charge cited is &quot;computervredebreuk,&quot; which is broadly equivalent to unauthorized access to computer systems, though the circumstances – namely that the access was the result of a police blunder – may raise uncomfortable questions about where liability actually sits when the front door is left wide open. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Oracle has promised a &quot;decisive new approach&quot; to MySQL, the popular open source database it owns, following growing criticism of its approach and the prospect of a significant fork in the code.

In a blog post published last week, Big Red, which acquired MySQL with Sun Microsystems in 2009, said MySQL has new engineering leadership at the company and &quot;a clear vision for 2026 and beyond.&quot;

The move follows criticism of Oracle&#39;s commitment to MySQL development over the past couple of years, which culminated in influential MySQL open source community members and users banding together to discuss their options, including forking the code and exploring an independent foundation model for governance.

In the post, Frederic Descamps, Oracle MySQL community manager, promised a new era of community engagement from the vendor. He said Oracle would take a three-pronged approach, firstly by introducing developer-focused features into the open source MySQL Community Edition. He said Big Red also planned to &quot;extend and enrich&quot; the developer community by offering more tools, frameworks, and connectors for MySQL.

&quot;Finally, we are increasing transparency and encouraging broader community participation, ensuring that more voices help guide MySQL&#39;s evolution,&quot; he said.

He added that more details would become available in a public webinar. As part of the new approach, Oracle has committed to greater transparency, answering one common complaint that it simply dumped new code without much discussion.

&quot;We will be publishing the development roadmap and facilitating contributions from the community – including worklogs and bug reports. There is great potential in community-driven extensibility, and we look forward to partnering directly with those interested in building the next generation of MySQL tools and extensions,&quot; Descamps said.

At a pre-FOSDEM MySQL and Friends event in Belgium last month, Oracle promised to take steps to &quot;repair&quot; its relationship with the MySQL community by moving &quot;commercial-only&quot; features into the database application&#39;s Community Edition and prioritizing developer needs. According to a summary seen by The Register, the key features include vector functions, which are considered critical for AI workloads.

Vadim Tkachenko previously worked for MySQL AB, the Swedish company that developed the database before it was bought by Sun Microsystems. Now CTO at open source consultancy Percona, he told us last month that MySQL was at a fork in the road under Oracle&#39;s management, with the developer community now having to choose its future: either under Oracle or as part of a different model. A group of developers and users met in San Francisco in January to discuss their options.

MySQL&#39;s founding developer, Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius, last year said he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; on hearing the news of job losses at Oracle&#39;s MySQL engineering team, while the system has seen a dramatic fall in the number of commits to the project. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Academics say they found a series of flaws affecting three popular password managers, all of which claim to protect user credentials in the event that their servers are compromised.

The team, comprised of researchers from ETH Zurich and Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), examined the &quot;zero-knowledge encryption&quot; promises made by Bitwarden, LastPass, and Dashlane, finding all three could expose passwords if attackers compromised servers.

The premise of zero-knowledge encryption is that user passwords are encrypted on their device, and the password manager&#39;s server acts merely as a dumb storage box for the encrypted credentials. Therefore, in the event that the vendor&#39;s servers are controlled by malicious parties, attackers wouldn&#39;t be able to view users&#39; secrets.

As one of the most popular alternatives to Apple and Google&#39;s own password managers, which together dominate the market, the researchers found Bitwarden was most susceptible to attacks, with 12 working against the open-source product. Seven distinct attacks worked against LastPass, and six succeeded in Dashlane.

The attacks don&#39;t exploit weaknesses in the same way that remote attackers could exploit vulnerabilities and target specific users. Instead, the researchers worked to test each platform&#39;s ability to keep secrets safe in the event they were compromised.

In most cases where attacks were successful, the researchers said they could retrieve encrypted passwords from the user, and in some cases, change the entries.

They used a malicious server model to test all of this – setting up servers that behaved like hacked versions of those used by the password managers. Seven of Bitwarden&#39;s 12 successful attacks led to password disclosure, whereas only three of LastPass&#39;s attacks led to the same end, and one for Dashlane.

All three vendors claim their products come with zero-knowledge encryption. The researchers noted that none of them outline the specific threat model their password manager secures against.

The researchers said: &quot;The majority of our attacks require simple interactions which users or their clients perform routinely as part of their usage of the product, such as logging in to their account, opening the vault and viewing the items, or performing periodic synchronization of data.

&quot;We also present attacks that require more complex user actions, such as key rotations, joining an organization, sharing credentials, or even clicking on a misleading dialog. Although assessing the probability of these actions is challenging, we believe that, within a vast user base, many users will likely perform them.&quot;

In the full paper [PDF], they went on to argue that password managers have escaped deep academic scrutiny until now, unlike end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. It is perhaps due to a perception that password managers are simple applications – deriving keys and then encrypting them. However, their codebases are more complex than that, often offering features such as the ability to share accounts with family members and featuring various ways to maintain backward-compatibility with older encryption standards.

Kenneth Paterson, professor of computer science at ETH Zurich, said &quot;we were surprised by the severity of the security vulnerabilities&quot; affecting the password managers.

&quot;Since end-to-end encryption is still relatively new in commercial services, it seems that no one had ever examined it in detail before.&quot;

The team&#39;s primary recommendation for vendors is to ensure that new users have access to the latest cryptographic standards by default.

One of the main reasons password manager providers haven&#39;t upgraded their codebases is that they fear doing so would irrevocably lose existing users&#39; secrets. The researchers said that some vendors have gone to extreme lengths to support older formats, which in turn creates complexity in the code.

The best way forward? The researchers suggested ensuring all new users are onboarded with the latest cryptographic standards, while offering existing customers the choice between migrating to them or staying put, but with the knowledge of the vulnerabilities.

&quot;We want our work to help bring about change in this industry,&quot; said Paterson. He claimed: &quot;The providers of password managers should not make false promises to their customers about security but instead communicate more clearly and precisely what security guarantees their solutions actually offer.&quot;

Dashlane published a comprehensive response, thanking the researchers, and said the infoseccers&#39; decision to test using a malicious server model represented &quot;a useful exercise.&quot;

The vendor also confirmed it had fixed the most serious issue – the attack researchers showed could lead to the disclosure of a password, and published a separate security advisory devoted to that.

&quot;Dashlane has fixed an issue that, if Dashlane&#39;s servers were fully compromised, could have allowed a downgrade of the encryption model used to generate encryption keys and protect user vaults,&quot; it said. &quot;This downgrade could result in the compromise of a weak or easily guessable Master Password, and the compromise of individual &#39;downgraded&#39; vault items.

&quot;This issue was the result of the allowed use of legacy cryptography. This legacy cryptography was supported by Dashlane in certain cases for backward compatibility and migration flexibility.

&quot;Dashlane has removed support for this legacy cryptography, which means these downgrade attacks are no longer possible.&quot;

Bitwarden, meanwhile, said in a post: &quot;Bitwarden has never been breached and believes third-party security assessments like these are critical to continue providing state of the art security to individuals and organizations.&quot;

It added: &quot;Thank you ETH Zurich for your insights and commitment to stronger password security.&quot;

A LastPass spokesperson told The Reg: &quot;Our Security team is grateful for the opportunity to engage with ETH Zurich and benefit from their research. While our own assessment of these risks may not fully align with the severity ratings assigned by the ETH Zurich team, we take all reported security findings seriously. We have already implemented multiple near‑term hardening measures while also establishing plans to remediate or reinforce the relevant components of our service on a timeline commensurate with the assessed risk.&quot;

The researchers said the vendors responded constructively to their outreach attempts and were working to mitigate the exploited weaknesses.

The researchers said it is highly likely that the same weaknesses they highlighted in the study apply to other vendors across the industry, and couldn&#39;t rule out the possibility the attacks are already known to the more advanced hackers, including those with government backing. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AIpocolypse A partner at accounting and consultancy giant KPMG in Australia was forced to cough up a AU$10k ($7,084/ £5,195) fine after he used AI to ace an internal training course on... AI.

Faced with questions on the use of AI, the unnamed partner uploaded training materials to an AI platform to help generate his response, according to a report in the FT.

The partner was just one of more than two dozen staff who have been rumbled for using AI tooling while taking internal exams, the consulting giant confirmed.

The unnamed KPMG partner&#39;s attempted use of AI on an internal test was first reported by the Australian Financial Review, and was flagged up in an Australian senate inquiry into governance.

Barbara Pocock, a senator with Australia&#39;s Greens party, referred to a &quot;misdemeanor&quot; at the firm, and said she was disappointed with the fine. &quot;We&#39;ve got a toothless system where con artists... get away with so much,&quot; she told a parliamentary committee last week.

KPMG Australia chief exec Andrew Yates was quoted as saying it was &quot;grappling&quot; with the impact of AI when it comes to internal training and testing.

&quot;It&#39;s a very hard thing to get on top of given how quickly society has embraced it,&quot; he said.

A KPMG spokesperson confirmed the FT story and told The Register the &quot;two dozen&quot; figure was confined to Australia. No similar reports have emerged outside the antipodes, apparently.

The accounting and consulting biz is not alone in its struggle. Rival Deloitte Australia had to refund a large chunk of the fee for a report it produced for the Australian government last year.

The report was littered with AI hallucinations, including imagined quotes from a court ruling and non-existent academic research.

In the UK, West Midlands&#39; chief constable Craig Guildford was prompted into retirement earlier this year after it emerged his force relied on Copilot when considering whether to block Israeli football fans from an Aston Villa - Maccabi Tel Aviv match.

The research threw up concerns about disruption at a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham. The only problem being no such match occurred.

Guildford&#39;s acting successor, Scott Green, said the matter is being investigated by IPSO and the force&#39;s own professional standards department. In the meantime, he said, Copilot had been switched off across the force. For now, at least. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is experiencing an outage, with users worldwide reporting that their timelines no longer show the usual information flow.

X (formerly Twitter) does not have a status page to indicate what is up or down, although its Developer Platform Status page said: &quot;All systems are operational.&quot; A glance at the incident history page shows that everything has been hunky dory so far in February.

However, for users expecting to see their timeline filled with the usual content, there is only emptiness. X.com appears to still be online, but the timeline is not loading.

Other users, according to xAI&#39;s Grok chatbot, have also experienced login failures, app or website load and refresh failures, and error messages across mobile apps and desktop.

The Register contacted the company to find out what happened, and how long the outage is likely to last, but we have yet to receive a response.

Problems started around 1300 UTC, and reports have flowed into the Downdetector website. The outage appears to be worldwide.

One user noted: &quot;The world is temporarily a better place.&quot;

X was last knocked offline after a recent outage at Cloudflare, although the cause of today&#39;s issue is not yet revealed. With luck, Musk will explain when the service staggers back to its feet.

Several users of rival services reacted with glee to the platform&#39;s misfortune. One on Bluesky posted: &quot;Good news.&quot;

Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 in a deal worth $44 billion. He dispensed with many employees and rebranded the company as X. The platform has since weathered an initial exodus of advertisers and users, as well as controversy after its AI chatbot, Grok, described itself as &quot;MechaHitler&quot; in 2025, which sent the X team scrambling to remove &quot;inappropriate posts.&quot; ®

New MacBooks, iPads, iPhone 17e, displays, and more are possible.﻿

Apple is hosting a “special Apple experience” in New York City on Wednesday, March 4th at 9AM ET, instead of at the Apple Park location it typically uses for events. It’s also hosting press in the cities of London and Shanghai at the same time.

The invitation includes the words “You’re invited” and an Apple logo depicted in segmented discs of yellow, green, and blue (the rumored colors of a new low-cost MacBook). Otherwise, it provides no hints about the purpose of the so-called experience. However, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has previously said that he’s expecting Apple to launch a low-cost A18 Pro chip-powered MacBook and new MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros, and Mac displays ”over the course of the next several weeks,“ alongside the iPhone 17e, a new base model iPad, and an M4 iPad Air. And maybe we’ll even see a preview of Apple’s new AI-infused Siri.

Apple’s don’t-call-it-an-event will be taking place during the big Mobile World Congress show Barcelona, Spain, which is running between March 2nd-5th.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The security camera maker’s Search Party feature, advertised during the Super Bowl, has sparked a surveillance backlash.

Today, let’s talk about the camera company Ring, lost dogs, and the surveillance state.

You probably saw this ad during the Super Bowl a couple of weekends ago:

Since it aired for a massive audience at the Super Bowl, Ring’s Search Party commercial has become a lightning rod for controversy — it’s easy to see how the same technology that can find lost dogs can be used to find people, and then used to invade our privacy in all kinds of uncomfortable ways, by cops and regular people alike.

Ring in particular has always been proud of its cooperation with law enforcement. That raises big questions about our civil rights, especially since Ring announced a partnership last fall with a company called Flock Safety, whose systems have been accessed by ICE. There’s some complication to that — we’ll come back to it in a bit.

The backlash to Ring’s Super Bowl ad was swift, intense, and effective: the data company PeakMetrics says conversation about the ad on social platforms like X actually peaked two days after the Super Bowl, and the vibes, as they measured them, were strikingly negative. I mean, you know it’s bad when Matt Nelson, who runs the weratedogs account, is posting videos like this:

Sen. Ed Markey called the ad “dystopian” and said it was proof Amazon, which owns Ring, needed to cease all facial recognition technology on Ring doorbells. He said, “This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance.”

And then, on Thursday, February 12th, just four days after the Super Bowl, Ring announced it was canceling its partnership with Flock, in a statement first reported by The Verge’s Jen Tuohy. That statement itself is a lot:

Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration. The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.

The company also goes on to say that Ring cameras were used by police in identifying a school shooter at Brown University in December 2025. It’s an odd non sequitur in a press release about canceling a controversial partnership that really explains a lot about Ring, and how the company sees itself.

As it happens, Ring’s founder Jamie Siminoff was just on Decoder a few months ago, talking about how and why he founded the company, and in detail about why he sees Ring’s mission as eliminating crime. Not selling cameras or doorbells, or floodlights, or anything else Ring makes, but getting rid of crime.

We actually talked about Search Party and how people might feel about that kind of surveillance, and how Ring works with the cops quite a bit. In fact, Jamie briefly left Ring in 2023, and the company slowed down on its work with law enforcement. But ever since he returned, the emphasis on crime and the work with police has only intensified. I asked him about it:

NILAY PATEL: You left, Amazon said we’re going to stop working with police, you came back, boy, Ring is going to work with police again. You have a partnership with Axon, which makes the taser, that allows law enforcement to get access to Ring footage. Did that feel like a two-way door? They made the wrong decision in your absence, and you came back and said, “We’re going to do this again”?

JAMIE SIMINOFF: I don’t know if it’s wrong or right, but I think different leadership does different things. I do believe that I spent a lot of time going on ride-alongs. I spent a lot of time in areas that I’d say are not safe for those people, and I’ve seen a lot of things where I think we can positively impact them. So, we don’t work with police in the way of ... I just want to be careful, as we’re not ... What we do allow is for agencies to ask for footage when something happens. We allow our neighbors, which I’ll say in this point are our customers, just to be clear, we allow our customers to anonymously decide whether or not they want to partake in that.

So, if they decide they don’t want to be part of this network and don’t want to help this public service agency that asks them, they just say no. If they decide that they do want to, which, by the way, a lot of people want to increase the security of their neighborhoods. A lot of people want their kids to grow up in safer neighborhoods, a lot of people want to have the tools to do that, and are in places that are dangerous. We give them the ability to say yes and make it more efficient for them to communicate with those public service agencies, and also do it in a very auditable digital format.

That’s the other side. Today, without these tools, if a police officer wanted to go and get footage from something, they’d have to go and knock on the door and ask you, and that’s not comfortable for anyone. There’s no digital audit trail of it, and, with this, they can do it efficiently with an audit trail. It is very clear, and it’s anonymous.

Jamie actually talked a lot about searching for dogs in this context, because one of the reasons he was so excited to come back to Ring was to use AI to search through the massive amounts of video generated by Ring cameras. In fact, he told me that Ring could not have built Search Party five years ago, because AI systems to do it weren’t available.

Jamie is nothing if not direct about this, which I appreciate. The man really thinks you can use AI and cameras to reduce or even eliminate crime. But I had a lot of questions about this:

JAIME SIMINOFF: But when you put AI into it, now, all of a sudden, you have this human element that AI gives you. I think, with our products in neighborhoods and, again, you have to be a little bit specific to it, I do see a path where we can actually start to take down crime in a neighborhood to call it close to zero. And I even said, there are some crimes that you can’t stop, of course.

NILAY PATEL: Mechanically, walk people through what you mean. You put enough Ring products in a neighborhood, and then AI does what to them that helps you get closer to the mission of zeroing out crime?

So, the mental model, or how I look at it, is that AI allows us to have ... If you had a neighborhood where you had unlimited resources, so every house had security guards and those security guards were people that worked the same house for 10 years or 20 years, and I mean that from a knowledge perspective. So, the knowledge they had of that house was extreme; they knew everything about you and that residence and your family, how you lived, the people that came in and out.

And then, if that neighborhood had an HOA with, call it private security, and those private security were also around and knew everything, what would happen? When a dog gets lost, you’d be like, “Oh, my gosh, my dog is lost.” Well, they would call each other, and one of them would find the dog very quickly. So, how do we change that and bring that into the digital world is—

Can I just ask you a question about that neighborhood specifically?

Do you ever stop and consider that that neighborhood might suck? Just the idea that every house on my street would have all-knowing private security guards, and I would have an HOA, and that HOA would have a private security force.

You can easily paint that as dystopia. Everyone’s so afraid that we have private cops on every corner, and I’m paying HOA fees, which is just a nightmare of its own.

So, I would assume you live in a safe neighborhood.

No, today, I’d go to ... If you want, I’ll take you to a place where people live and have to, when they get home from school, lock their doors and stay in their house, and they can’t go out and—

But I’m just saying that that model is “everybody is so afraid that they have private cops.”

I think the model is that doing crime in a neighborhood like that is not profitable, and I think that you want people to move into another job. I don’t think that crime is a good thing and so I think ... But listen, it certainly is an argument to have, I do believe that ... I think safer neighborhoods allow for kids to grow up in a better environment and I think that allows them to be able to focus on the things that matter and so that’s what we’re going for.

The model is that there are cops everywhere. That level of privacy.

Yeah, it’s not cops. I think it’s more that you’ll have the ability to understand what’s happening. It’s not like ... But yeah, I think, listen, it’s a fair statement, I guess. I think I want to live in a safe place.

There’s a lot of intelligence in your neighborhood, and maybe it’s private security, maybe it’s not. What does the AI do? Does it just make the camera smarter? It lets you do a more intelligent assessment of what the cameras are seeing?

Right now, we just say motion detection, motion detection, motion detection. It’s funny, when I started Ring… The book was fun because I got to go back and actually go through this whole story of how this thing came to be, and motion detection was an amazing invention. You’re in the airport, and there’s a motion at your front door, and you look at it like, “Wow, this is crazy.”

Now, with AI, we shouldn’t be telling you about motion detection; we should be telling you what’s there, when you should look at it, when it matters, and we shouldn’t be bothering you all the time. That’s what I mean by this idea of these security guards at your house or in your neighborhood. There should be this intelligence in your neighborhood that can tell you when you should be trying to be part of something, but not always tell you. So, it’s not just like, “Car, car, dog, person, person.” It’s like, “Hey, look at this. You want to pay attention to this right now.”

I really pressed Jamie on this because I still don’t think it is entirely clear how Ring accomplishes the elimination of crime through AI alone. And it’s why people don’t trust the company when it says it won’t use systems that can find a dog to do things that otherwise violate our rights. After all, if your goal is to use AI to stop crime, and you built an AI system that can find a dog… well, it’s pretty obvious what comes next, right?

NILAY PATEL: Do you think when you talk about zero out crime in a neighborhood, the idea that everyone in a neighborhood has one of those illuminated Ring signs in the front yard, is that enough to—

Is that just enough of a deterrent? The bad guys will know their face is going to be captured on video, and that will be analyzed by an AI, and something will happen. Do you have to do more outbound deterrents?

I think that’s a part of it. Awareness is a big part of it. I think there are ways with lights also, using lighting to do stuff, that’s a big part of it. I think having just ... If, all of a sudden, someone comes outside because something’s an anomaly, that’s a big part of it. It doesn’t have to be some crazy thing. And that’s what I was saying, is a lot of these little things add up to make that work.

So, when you think about it, okay, we can bring crime down in a neighborhood to close to zero in a neighborhood, what are the ratcheting steps? Does everyone just get the Ring camera, and your platform does all the work? Is it that someone gets caught and they tell all their friends in jail that they got caught? What are the steps?

I think it’s really about bringing neighbors together for this particular thing. So, it’s about how you individually… and we’ve always thought about how each house is its own node controlled by the neighbors, so controlled by the person, and I’ll keep going back to that, which is one hundred percent, your video is in your control; everything you’re doing is in your control, whether you want to take part in anything is in your control. That has to be the first layer of all of it.

But then, when something happens, do you want to take part in it? So, if you get an alert that this dog looks like the dog that’s in front of your house, can you contact your neighbor? You can decide not to take part in it, and then no one will ever know, and it’s fine, it’s just basically deleted, or you can take part in it. I think that’s how we can do things that can make a neighborhood into this node where individual neighbors are all on their own, but when things happen, they can work together as they want to.

And you think that AI will accelerate the process?

I think AI is a co-pilot. It is their assistant, and it’s helping them to figure this out. Because, again, if you’re just getting every motion alert, and if you have eight cameras and you’re just getting motion alerts all day, no human being can parse all this data. So that’s what I was talking to Jen about, is that I do think I see a way to use AI to help feed better data to us, which allows us to make better decisions and work together better.

This is where we get to Flock, which Ring announced a partnership with in October 2025. Flock primarily makes cameras and systems to search video for the cops. You’ve probably seen Flock’s devices where you live — they’re those little solar-powered cameras and tracking devices affixed to streetlights or placed in the center of parking lots. They vacuum up large amounts of data, and the company claims it is anonymized before it’s made available to partners, which in most cases is local law enforcement.

However, according to in-depth reporting from the excellent 404 Media, Flock’s data has often found its way to ICE, the FBI, the Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies, without the requirement of a warrant. That’s because that data is willingly provided by local police.

Last month, under intense scrutiny about what a deal with Flock would mean, Ring said that this partnership was not yet “live,” and that, “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them.” For its part, Flock says the same — that it doesn’t actually work with ICE, but rather local law enforcement, and it’s those local agencies that work with ICE. This is the complication I mentioned earlier.

If you’re a Decoder listener, you know where this is all going. I asked Jamie about all these databases, who owns them, and what it means to connect them all with AI:

NILAY PATEL: But when you connect a bunch of those databases, particularly to facial recognition, there’s a turn in the privacy conversation where the stakes ratchet up really high, where maybe it’s gone forever.

How are you thinking about that decision-making? Okay, we have a lot of intelligence in the AI; it’s trivial for the AI to connect to another store of information. That’s a thing you can do with AI, especially at a big company like Amazon, where you have lots of other stores of information. There’s a line, what’s the line for you?

JAMIE SIMINOFF: There is a responsibility, obviously just to build safe products. So let’s just start with that. Yeah, we did announce facial, we call it Familiar Faces, but that’s not connected, that’s just for your... Your iPhone today. If you search your iPhone, it’s crazy. Search for someone’s name in your photos, and their pictures come up.

So I do think there’s a balance between not allowing technology to exist that should exist that helps people and gives them more efficiency, gives them safer homes and then also, obviously, not creating this dystopian place. And so, I think that’s the responsibility, but what we’re doing with Familiar Faces is we’re just giving you the ability to say, when my wife comes home, don’t... Because it is silly. Why do I get an alert when my wife comes home? I don’t want it, I don’t need it.

I’m asking this for a lot of reasons, but I look at what’s broadly happening with surveillance footage out in the world. And I’m not saying Ring is participating in this, I’m just giving you an example. ICE has facial recognition systems, and they are arguing that a positive match in their facial recognition system is a definitive determination of someone’s immigration status. That’s way out there. I don’t think you’re doing that.

But you can get to, “Okay, we have facial recognition, we have a bunch of evidence coming off of Ring cameras, to make it really safe, you want to go from passive surveillance to active surveillance. That’s what the studies show. Now the camera will literally identify the criminal by face and tell the cops this person tried to steal a car from this driveway,” and that’s the thing that would get you to actually zero out crime.

There’s a lot of risk in those steps. But if I draw the thread from what you’re saying, it’s all the way to the idea that the criminals won’t come here because the cameras will know who they are and tell the cops. Are you willing to go that far?

I think it’s also that the cameras will alert people. Part of what made Ring and what made neighbors safer with Ring 1.0, and I think we are in Ring 2.0, is that there was no presence at the home. How did people break into homes? They would go and be knock-knock burglars. They would knock-knock, no one was home. It was 3PM, they’d go to the homes next door, find a place that was empty, and they’d go into the home.Ring allowed you to, now, all of a sudden, when someone comes up to the door, you’re like, “Oh, I got a motion alert. Hi, what’s going on?” and so it gave a presence to the home. So, I don’t think you have to go as far as that real time stuff to get to where we’re talking about, I think it’s more of the anomaly detection and allowing people to make it so that, if someone comes in, that you’re aware of what’s happening around the neighborhood because right now there’s no awareness of what’s going on around it.

So I don’t think it’s as dystopian as where you’re going, and certainly it’s not what we’re building, and I do think we can impact things to a really high level in neighborhoods. Which, again, to the Jen Tuohy thing, in neighborhoods is what we were talking about, that with AI and what we’re doing with a bunch of Rings together. I think even the Dog Search Party is a good way to look at it, which is how these cameras come together for good in the neighborhood.

Today, the backlash against surveillance has led Ring to kill that Flock deal. The company is also doing damage control about Search Party, telling The Verge that the technology that powers the feature is not “capable” of being used to find people, and that there’s no indication that such features are on future road maps.

Sure, it seems obvious that Ring has a lot of trust to earn back here, and certainly, we are all thinking about what it means to put internet-connected security cameras in our homes. I think that’s good — and certainly overdue.

But let me complicate this a little for you. At the same time this conversation about Ring is happening, we’re also watching regular people record the police and ICE with their cell phones, capturing critical documentary evidence of how those agencies are violating the rights of everyday Americans in ways that is leading to change, however slow.

Minnesota governor Tim Walz is now telling people to hit record when they see ICE so the footage can be used in future prosecutions. And just last week, the FBI released video that Google appears to have specifically recovered from a Nest camera system at Nancy Guthrie’s house, in order to help identify her kidnapper.

That’s a lot of video that’s being captured and used in ways that maybe don’t feel so invasive, and in some cases even feels good. But the systems that create, store, and share that video are all the same, and the guardrails around them are just as weak as whatever makes us feel uncomfortable about Ring.

I’m not sure how to feel about all of that video, especially in a world where AI makes it easy to fake, and having some source of truth seems more important than ever. I asked Jamie about that, too — whether Ring will control all the video, or sign it with some metadata so people can ensure it’s real.

NILAY PATEL: Presuming we have to have an authenticated server, there’s a crime in my neighborhood, and I’ve opted in, and we’re going to say the cops can only get the video from the Ring server, where we know it’s true. I might not be as in control of my video anymore.

JAMIE SIMINOFF: No, not how it’s built and not while I’m here because the way it works is that you will decide if you want to or not want to share that video, which is your property, with someone. Now, once you share it, then it is up to us to figure out, to your point, how do we share it, how do we make sure that the digital fingerprint goes all the way through, or how does the chain of custody work of this video to make sure there’s no fake in the process of it? I think this is why it is important to build these systems.

It’s going to be important, though. This is also where the government is going to have to step in. We’re going to have to deal with this across the board because we also have video coming off of cell phones. So, we do need to figure out how to build... And there’s going to be companies, Axon would probably be one of the companies. I don’t want to speak for them, but they have evidence.com, so to build these evidentiary systems to take in…

Because Ring is one part of taking in data around, call it a crime scene, but cell phone video is maybe even more of a source today. So, how do you take that in? How do you make sure that it actually was captured on the iPhone directly and not tampered with between the two things? We’re going to have to figure it all out. I think we have to work together on it, and the AI stuff is pushing us to do it. I am proud that with Ring, we have built it so that you can take it directly and keep it on the server. You can understand where it was, where it’s from, where it was created, and we have that digital fingerprint on it and the audit trail of it.

You’re going to have to do that more and more as this world is changing, you’re just not going to be able to trust that just because someone sends you a video doesn’t mean it’s true.

You get the feeling we’ll be coming back to that idea quite a lot in the years to come.

But today Ring has canceled its deal with Flock, and Flock itself is putting out blog posts flatly stating it does not have a contract with ICE, and noting that Ring’s other partner, Axon, does in fact have an ICE contract.

In the meantime, Search Party is still active and on by default, although you can just go into settings and flip it off. And the enormous amount of video we all generate is being uploaded to servers run by big companies that have their own dealings with governments and law enforcement agencies far outside of our control.

There are a lot of solutions to all these problems, and lots of ways to design regulations to balance out privacy and civil liberties with the needs of police. But right now, in 2026 America, I’m not sure were really going to be able to do that.

So we’re going to keep pushing the leaders of these companies on what they really mean, and keep running the answers so you can listen and decide. I think it’s about time we started thinking about how all the technology we use to make our own lives better affects other people.

Because that bigger conversation we need to have? Yeah, that’s what it’s really about.

﻿Sony might push the debut of its next-generation console back to 2029 due to AI memory demands.

Sony and Nintendo are reportedly feeling squeezed by RAM shortages as demand from AI data centers takes up an increasing share of memory chip production. In response to rising costs and dwindling chip supplies, Sony is considering pushing back the release of its next PlayStation console “to 2028 or even 2029,” according to industry sources cited by Bloomberg, while Nintendo may increase the $450 price of its Switch 2 console this year.

That delay would be a considerable divergence from Sony’s usual release schedule, having launched a new console generation every six to seven years since the original PlayStation debuted in 1994. As the current PlayStation 5 console was released in November 2020, it would have been expected to launch before the end of 2027.

The memory shortages are also a blow for Nintendo, which pointedly did not increase the Switch 2 launch price last year despite Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Bloomberg offers no specifics for how much the price might increase. We have reached out to Sony and Nintendo for comment.

﻿Leaker Ice Universe has shared a video of the tech in action.

Samsung has released a new advertisement for its upcoming Galaxy S26 launch that all-but confirms rumors of a new display with a built-in privacy mode. Leaked videos show that the feature could be capable of entirely blacking out content from specific apps or parts of the display when viewed at an angle.

The new advert shows a woman reading a racy romance novel on a subway, while curious passengers look over her shoulder. An overlay shows a quick flick of a “Zero-peeking privacy” toggle, which blacks out the titillating content for the nosy onlookers.

That might sound similar to existing privacy filters, which have been available as after-market screen protectors for years, or found built into products including certain HP laptops. But leaks say what Samsung has in store for the S26 range is different.

It will reportedly use a new type of OLED panel that Samsung Display first debuted two years ago at MWC 2024 called Flex Magic Pixel. It allows viewing angles to be adjusted on a pixel-by-pixel basis, so the privacy effect is only applied to certain parts of the screen at a time. Combined with some AI, that means it could automatically protect sensitive information in a banking app, or be used to hide notifications in a messaging app, as shown in this short video clip shared by the reliable leaker Ice Universe.

We’ll find out more soon enough — Samsung has confirmed that its Unpacked launch event will take place later this month, on February 25th.

﻿Disney and Paramount allege that Seedance 2.0 is distributing and reproducing their intellectual property.

TikTok creator ByteDance says that it is working to improve safeguards on its new AI video generator after Disney, Paramount, and Hollywood trade groups accused the tool of violating copyright protections. Concerns were raised after hyperrealistic videos generated by the Seedance 2.0 model went viral last week, with the likeness of actors, such as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and characters from Dragon Ball Z, Family Guy, and Pokémon.

“ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,” a ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement shared by CNBC. “We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users.”

ByteDance’s response comes after receiving complaints from major studios. In a cease and desist letter sent on Friday, Disney accused ByteDance of “hijacking” its protected characters by “reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works” that feature them. Deadline reports that Paramount Skydance followed with its own cease and desist letter, demanding that ByteDance remove all infringing instances of Paramount content and prevent it from being generated in the future.

Hollywood trade groups have also weighed in, including the Motion Picture Association (MPA) and SAG-AFTRA talent union. MPA CEO Charles Rivkin issued a statement accusing ByteDance of engaging in copyright infringement at a “massive scale,” and disregarding well-established laws that underpin “millions of American jobs.” SAG-AFTRA said that its members’ voices and likenesses have been used by Seedance 2.0 without authorization.

“This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement to AP News. “Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”

            <div id="article-text">When work went remote, the sound of business changed. What began as a scramble to make home offices functional has evolved into a revolution in how people hear and are heard. From education to enterprises, companies across industries have reimagined what clear, reliable communication can mean in a hybrid world. For major audio and communications enterprises like Shure and Zoom, that transformation has been powered by artificial intelligence, new acoustic technologies, and a shared mission: making connection effortless.

Necessity during the pandemic accelerated years of innovation in months.

&quot;Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration,&quot; says chief ecosystem officer at Zoom, Brendan Ittelson. &quot;That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem.&quot;

Audio is a foundation for trust, understanding, and collaboration. Poor sound quality can distort meaning and fatigue listeners, while crisp audio and intelligent processing can make digital interactions feel nearly as natural as in-person exchanges.

&quot;If you think about the fundamental need here,&quot; adds chief technology officer at Shure, Sam Sabet, &quot;It&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed, and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate.&quot;

For both Ittelson and Sabet, AI now sits at the center of this progress. For Shure, machine learning powers real-time noise suppression, adaptive beamforming, and spatial audio that tunes itself to a room’s acoustics. For Zoom, AI underpins every layer of its platform, from dynamic noise reduction to automated meeting summaries and intelligent assistants that anticipate user needs. These tools are transforming communication from reactive to proactive, enabling systems that understand intent, context, and emotion.

&quot;Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing,&quot; says Sabet. &quot;Having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.&quot;

The future, they suggest, is one where technology fades into the background. As audio devices and AI companions learn to self-optimize, users won’t think about microphones or meeting links. Instead, they’ll simply connect. Both companies are now exploring agentic AI systems and advanced wireless solutions that promise to make collaboration seamless across spaces, whether in classrooms, conference rooms, or virtual environments yet to come.

&quot;It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work,&quot; says Ittelson.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.

This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.

Now as the pandemic ushered in the cultural shift that led to our increasingly virtual world, it also sparked a flurry of innovation in the audio and video industries to keep employees and customers connected and businesses running. Today we&#39;re going to talk about the AI technologies behind those innovations, the impact on audio innovation, and the continuing emerging opportunities for further advances in audio capabilities.

My guests today are Sam Sabet, chief technology officer at Shure, and Brendan Ittelson, chief ecosystem officer at Zoom.

Sam Sabet: Thank you, Megan. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here and I&#39;m looking forward to this conversation with both you and Brendan. It should be a very exciting conversation.

Brendan Ittelson: Thank you so much for having me today. I&#39;m looking forward to the conversation and all the topics we have to dive into on this area.

Megan: Fantastic. Lovely to have you both here. And Sam, just to set some context, I wonder if we could start with the pandemic and the innovation that really was born out of necessity. I mean, when it became clear that we were all going to be virtual for the foreseeable future, I wonder what was the first technological mission for Shure?

Sam: Yeah, very good question. The pandemic really accelerated a lot of innovation around virtual communications and fundamentally how we perform our everyday jobs remotely. One of our first technological mission when the pandemic happened and everybody ended up going home and performing their functions remotely was to make sure that people could continue to communicate effectively, whether that&#39;s for business meetings, virtual events, or educational purposes. We focused on collaboration and enhancing collaboration tools. And ideally what we were aiming to do, or we focused on, was to basically improve the ease of use and configuration of audio tool sets.

Because unlike the office environment where it might be a lot more controlled, people are working from non-traditional areas like home offices or other makeshift solutions, we needed to make sure that people could still get pristine audio and that studio level audio even in uncontrolled environments that are not really made for that. We expedited development in our software solutions. We created tool sets that allowed for ease of deployment and remote configuration and management so we could enable people to continue doing the things they needed to do without having to worry about the underlying technology.

Megan: And Brendan, during that time, it seemed everyone became a Zoom user of some sort. I mean, what was the first mission at Zoom when virtual connection became this necessity for everyone?

Brendan: Well, our mission fundamentally didn&#39;t change. It&#39;s always been about delivering frictionless communications. What shifted was the urgency and the magnitude of what we were doing. Our focus shifted on how we do this reliably, securely, and to scale to ensure these millions of new users could connect instantly without friction. We really shifted our thinking of being just a business continuity tool to becoming a lifeline for so many individuals and industries. The stories that we heard across education, healthcare, and just general human connection, the number of those moments that matter to people that we were able to help facilitate just became so important. We really focused on how can we be there and make it frictionless so folks can focus on that human connection. And that accelerated our thinking in terms of innovation and reinforced the thought that we need to focus on the simplicity, accessibility, and trust in communication technology so that people could focus on that connection and not the technology that makes it possible.

Megan: That&#39;s so true. It did really just become an absolute lifeline for people, didn&#39;t it? And before we dive into the technologies beyond these emerging capabilities, I wonder if we could first talk about just the importance of clear audio. I mean, Sam, as much as we all worry over how we look on Zoom, is how we sound perhaps as or even more impactful?

Sam: Yeah, you&#39;re absolutely correct. I mean, clear audio is absolutely critical for effective communications. Video quality is very important absolutely, but poor audio can really hinder understanding and engagement. As a matter of fact, there&#39;s studies and research from areas such as Yale University that say that poor audio can make understanding somewhat more challenged and even affect retention of information. Especially in an educational type environment where there&#39;s a lot of background noise and very differing types of spaces like auditoriums and lecture halls, it really becomes a high priority that you have great audio quality. And during the pandemic, as you said, and as Brendan rightly said, it became one of our highest priorities to focus on technologies like beamforming mics and ways to focus on the speaker&#39;s voice and minimize that unwanted background noise so that we could ensure that the communication was efficient, was well understood, and that it removed the distraction so people could be able to actually communicate and retain the information that was being shared.

Megan: It is incredible just how impactful audio can be, can&#39;t it? Brendan, I mean as you said, remote and hybrid collaboration is part of Zoom&#39;s DNA. What observations can you share about how users have grown along with the technological advancements and maybe how their expectations have grown as well?

Brendan: Definitely. I mean, users now expect seamless and intelligent experiences. Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration. That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem. When we look at it, we&#39;re really looking at these trends in terms of how people want to be better when they&#39;re at home. For example, AI-powered tools like Smart Summaries, translation and noise suppression to help people stay productive and connected no matter where they&#39;re working. But then this also comes into play at the office. We&#39;re starting to see folks that dive into our technology like Intelligent Director and Smart Name Tags that create that meeting equity even when they&#39;re in a conference room.

So, the remote experience and the room experience all are similar and create that same ability to be seen, heard, and contribute. And we&#39;re now diving further into this that it&#39;s beyond just meetings. Zoom is really transforming into an AI-first work platform that&#39;s focused on human connection. And so that goes beyond the meetings into things like Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Events and Webinars, the Zoom Contact Center and more. And all of this being brought together using our AI Companion at its core to help connect all of those different points of connection for individuals.

Megan: I mean, so Brendan, we know it wasn&#39;t only workplaces that were affected by the pandemic, it was also the education sector that had to undergo a huge change. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how Zoom has operated in that higher education sphere as well.

Brendan: Definitely. Education has always been a focus for Zoom and an area that we&#39;ve believed in. Because education and learning is something as a company we value and so we have invested in that sector. And personally being the son of academics, it is always an area that I find fascinating. We continue to invest in terms of how do we make the classroom a stronger space? And especially now that the classroom has changed, where it can be in person, it can be virtual, it can be a mix. And using Zoom and its tools, we&#39;re able to help bridge all those different scenarios to make learning accessible to students no matter their means.

That&#39;s what truly excites us, is being able to have that technology that allows people to pursue their desires, their interests, and really up-level their pursuits and inspire more. We&#39;re constantly investing in how to allow those messages to get out and to integrate in the flow of communication and collaboration that higher education uses, whether that&#39;s being integrated into the classroom, into learning management systems, to make that a seamless flow so that students and their educators can just collaborate seamlessly. And also that we can support all the infrastructure and administration that helps make that possible.

Megan: Absolutely. Such an important thing. And Sam, Shure as well, could you talk to us a bit about how you worked in that kind of education space as well from an audio point of view?

Sam: Absolutely. Actually, this is a topic that&#39;s near and dear to my heart because I&#39;m actually an adjunct professor in my free time.

Sam: And the challenges of trying to do this sort of a hybrid lecture, if you will. And Shure has been particularly well suited for this environment and we&#39;ve been focused on it and investing in technologies there for decades. If you think about how a lecture hall is structured, it&#39;s a little different than just having a meeting around the conference table. And Shure has focused on creating products that allow this combination of a presenter scenario along with a meeting space plus the far end where users or students are remote, they can hear intelligibly what&#39;s happening in the lecture hall, but they can also participate.

Between our products like the Ceiling Mic Arrays and our wireless microphones that are purpose built for presenters and educators like our MXW neXt product line, we&#39;ve created technologies that allow those two previously separate worlds to integrate together. And then add that onto integrating with Zoom and other products that allow for that collaboration has been very instrumental. And again, being a user and providing those lectures, I can see a night and day difference and just how much more effective my lectures are today from where they were five to six years ago. And that&#39;s all just made possible by all the technologies that are purpose built for these scenarios and integrating more with these powerful tools that just make the job so much more seamless.

Megan: Absolutely fascinating that you got to put the technology to use yourself as well to check that it was all working well. And you mentioned AI there, of course. I mean, Sam, what AI technologies have had the most significant impact on recent audio advancements too?

Sam: Yeah. Absolutely. If you think about the fundamental need here, it&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate. With our innovations at Shure, we&#39;ve leveraged the cutting-edge technologies to both enhance communication effectiveness and to align seamlessly with evolving features in unified communications like the ones that Brandon just mentioned in the Zoom platforms.

We partner with industry leaders like Zoom to ensure that we&#39;re providing the ability to be able to focus on that needed audio and eliminate all the background distractions. AI has transformed that audio technology with things like machine learning algorithms that enable us to do more real-time audio processing and significantly enhancing things like noise reduction and speech isolation. Just to give you a simple example, our IntelliMix Room audio processing software that we&#39;ve released as well as part of a complete room solution uses AI to optimize sound in different environments.

And really that&#39;s one of the fundamental changes in this period, whether that&#39;s pandemic or post-pandemic, is that the key is really flexibility and being able to adapt to changing work environments. Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing. And so having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and are able to self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.

And then last but not least, AI has transformed the way audio and video integrate. For example, we utilize voice recognition systems that integrate with intelligent cameras so that we enable voice tracking technology so that cameras can not only identify who&#39;s speaking, but you have the ability to hear and see people clearly. And that in general just enhances the overall communication experience.

Megan: Wow. It&#39;s just so much innovation in quite a short space of time really. I mean, Brendan, you mentioned AI a little bit there beforehand, but I wonder what other AI technologies have had the biggest impact as Zoom builds out its own emerging capabilities?

Brendan: Definitely. And I couldn&#39;t agree more with Sam that, I mean, AI has made such a big shift and it&#39;s really across the spectrum. And when I think about it, there&#39;s almost three tiers when you look at the stack. You start off at the raw audio where AI is doing those things like noise suppression, echo cancellation, voice enhancements. All of that just makes this amazing audio signal that can then go into the next layer, which is the speech AI and natural language processing. Which starts to open up those items such as the real-time transcription, translation, searchable content to make the communication not just what&#39;s heard, but making it more accessible to more individuals and inclusive by providing that content in a format that is best for them.

And then you take those two layers and put the generative and agentic AI on top of that, that can start surfacing insights, summarize the conversation, and even take actions on someone&#39;s behalf. It really starts to change the way that people work and how they have access and allows them to connect. I think it is a huge shift and I&#39;m very excited by how those three levels start to interact to really enable people to do more and to connect thanks to AI.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. So much rich information that can come out from a single call now because of those sorts of tools. And following on from that, Brendan, I mean, you mentioned before the Zoom AI Companion. I wondered if you could talk a bit about what were your top priorities when building that product to ensure it was truly useful for your customers?

Brendan: Definitely. When we developed AI Companion, we had two priority focus areas from day one, trust and security, and then accuracy and relevance. On the trust side, it was a non-negotiable that customer data wouldn&#39;t be used to train our models. People need to know that their conversations and content are private and secure.

Brendan: And then with accuracy, we needed to ensure AI outputs weren&#39;t generic but grounded in the actual context of a meeting, a chat or a product. But the real story here when I think about AI Companion is the customer value that it delivers. AI Companion helps people save time with meeting recaps, task generation, and proactive prep for the next session. It reduces that friction in hybrid work, whether you&#39;re in a meeting room, a Zoom room, or collaborating across different collaboration tools like Microsoft or Google. And it enables more equitable participation by surfacing the right context for everyone no matter where and how they&#39;re working.

All this leads to a result where it&#39;s practical, trustworthy, and embedded where work happens. And it&#39;s just not another tool to manage, it&#39;s there in someone&#39;s flow of work to help them along the way.

Megan: Yeah. That trust piece is just so important, isn&#39;t it, today? And Sam, as much as AI has impacted audio innovation, audio has also had an impact on AI capabilities. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about audio as a data input and the advancements technologies like large language models, LLMs, are enabling.

Sam: Absolutely. Audio is really a rich data source that&#39;s added a new dimension to AI capabilities. If you think about speech recognition or natural language processing, they&#39;ve had significant advances due to audio data that&#39;s provided for them. And to Brendan&#39;s point about trust and accuracy, I like to think of the products that Shure enables customers with as essentially the eyes and ears in the room for leading AI companions just like the Zoom AI Companion. You really need that pristine audio input to be able to trust the accuracy of what the AI generates. These AI Companions have been very instrumental in the way we do business every day. I mean, between transcription, speaker attributions, the ability to add action items within a meeting and be able to track what&#39;s happening in our interactions, all of that really has to rely on that accurate and pristine input from audio into the AI. I feel that further improves the trust that our end users have to the results of AI and be able to leverage it more.

If you think about it, if you look at how AI audio inputs enhance that interactive AI system, it enables more natural and intuitive interactions with AI. And it really allows for that seamless integration and the ability for users to use it without having to worry about, is the room set up correctly? Is the audio level proper? And when we talk even about agentic AI, we&#39;re working on future developments where systems can self-heal or detect that there are issues in the environment so that they can autocorrect and adapt in all these different environments and further enable the AI to be able to do a much more effective job, if you will.

Megan: Sam, you touched on future developments there. I wonder if we could close our conversation today with a bit of a future forward look, if we could. Brendan, can you share innovations that Zoom is working on now and what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Brendan: Well, your timing for this question is absolutely perfect because we&#39;ve just wrapped up Zoomtopia 2025.

Brendan: And this is where we discussed a lot of the new AI innovations that we have coming to Zoom. Starting off, there&#39;s AI Companion 3.0. And we&#39;ve launched this next generation of agentic AI capabilities in Zoom Workplace. And with 3.0 when it releases, it isn&#39;t just about transcribing, it&#39;s turned into really a platform that helps you with follow-up task, prep for your next conversation, and even proactively suggest how to free up your time. For example, AI Companion can help you schedule meetings intelligently across time zones, suggest which meetings you can skip, and still stay informed and even prepare you with context and insights before you walk into the conversation. It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work. And for hybrid work specifically, we introduced Zoomie Group Assistant, which will be a big leap for hybrid collaboration.

Acting as an assistant for a group chat and meetings, you can simply ask, “@Zoomie, what&#39;s the latest update on the project?” Or “@Zoomie, what are the team&#39;s action items?” And then get instant answers. Or because we&#39;re talking about audio here, you can go into a conference room and say, &quot;Hey, Zoomie,&quot; and get help with things like checking into a room, adjusting lights, temperature, or even sharing your screen. And while all these are built-in features, we&#39;re also expanding the platform to allow custom AI agents through our AI Studio, so organizations can bring their own agents or integrate with third-party ones.

Zoom has always believed in an open platform and philosophy and that is continuing. Folks using AI Companion 3.0 will be able to use agents across platforms to work with the workflows that they have across all the different SaaS vendors that they might have in their environment, whether that&#39;s Google, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Cisco, and so many other tools.

Megan: Fantastic. It certainly sounds like a tool I could use in my work, so I look forward to hearing more about that. And Sam, we&#39;ve touched on there are so many exciting things happening in audio too. What are you working on at Shure? And what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Sam: At Shure, our engineering teams are really working on a range of exciting projects, but particularly we&#39;re working on developing new collaboration solutions that are integral for IT end users. And these integrate obviously with the leading UC platforms.

We&#39;re integrating audio and video technologies that are scalable, reliable solutions. And we want to be able to seamlessly connect these to cloud services so that we can leverage both AI technologies and the tool sets available to optimize every type of workspace essentially. Not just meeting rooms, but lecture halls, work from home scenarios, et cetera.

The other area that we really focus on in terms of our reliability and quality really comes from our DNA in the pro audio world. And that&#39;s really all-around wireless audio technologies. We&#39;re developing our next-generation wireless systems and these are going to offer even greater reliability and range. And they really become ideal for everything from a large-scale event to personal home use and the gamut across that whole spectrum. And I think all of that in partnership with our partners like Zoom will help just facilitate the modern workspace.

Megan: Absolutely. So much exciting innovation clearly going on behind the scenes. Thank you both so much.

Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.

In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested.Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the accounts was suddenly threatening her. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.

ALS stole this musician’s voice. AI let him sing again.

There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease, it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again. Read the full story.

            <h2>The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132516/cesar-de-la-fuente-using-ai-antibiotics-hunt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was just a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life, César de la Fuente compiled a list of the world’s biggest problems. He ranked them inversely by how much money governments were spending to solve them. Antimicrobial resistance topped the list.

Twenty years on, the problem has not gone away. If anything, it’s gotten worse. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis, published in the Lancet, predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050. In a July 2025 essay in Physical Review Letters, de la Fuente, now a bioengineer and computational biologist, and synthetic biologist James Collins warned of a looming “post­antibiotic” era in which infections from drug-resistant strains of common bacteria like Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which can often still be treated by our current arsenal of medications, become fatal. “The antibiotic discovery pipeline remains perilously thin,” they wrote, “impeded by high development costs, lengthy timelines, and low returns on investment.”

But de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence to bring about a different future. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments.

His quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. In August 2025 his team, which includes 16 scientists in Penn’s Machine Biology Group, described peptides hiding in the genetic code of ancient single-celled organisms called archaea. Before that, they’d excavated a list of candidates from the venom of snakes, wasps, and spiders. And in an ongoing project de la Fuente calls “molecular de-­extinction,” he and his collaborators have been scanning published genetic sequences of extinct species for potentially functional molecules. Those species include hominids like Neanderthals and Denisovans and charismatic megafauna like woolly mammoths, as well as ancient zebras and penguins. In the history of life on Earth, de la Fuente reasons, maybe some organism evolved an antimicrobial defense that could be helpful today. Those long-gone codes have given rise to resurrected compounds with names like ­mammuthusin-2 (from woolly mammoth DNA), mylodonin-2 (from the giant sloth), and hydrodamin-1 (from the ancient sea cow). Over the last few years, this molecular binge has enabled de la Fuente to amass a library of more than a million genetic recipes.

At 40 years old, de la Fuente has also collected a trophy case of awards from the American Society for Microbiology, the American Chemical Society, and other organizations. (In 2019, this magazine named him one of “35 Innovators Under 35” for bringing computational approaches to antibiotic discovery.) He’s widely recognized as a leader in the effort to harness AI for real-world problems. “He’s really helped pioneer that space,” says Collins, who is at MIT. (The two have not collaborated in the laboratory, but Collins has long been at the forefront of using AI for drug discovery, including the search for antibiotics. In 2020, Collins’s team used an AI model to predict a broad-­spectrum antibiotic, halicin, that is now in preclinical development.)

The world of antibiotic development needs as much creativity and innovation as researchers can muster, says Collins. And de la Fuente’s work on peptides has pushed the field forward: “César is marvelously talented, very innovative.”

De la Fuente describes antimicrobial resistance as an “almost impossible” problem, but he sees plenty of room for exploration in the word almost. “I like challenges,” he says, “and I think this is the ultimate challenge.”

The use, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics, he says, drives antimicrobial resistance. And the problem is growing unchecked because conventional ways to find, make, and test the drugs are prohibitively expensive and often lead to dead ends. “A lot of the companies that have attempted to do antibiotic development in the past have ended up folding because there’s no good return on investment at the end of the day,” he says.

Antibiotic discovery has always been a messy, noisy endeavor, driven by serendipity and fraught with uncertainty and misdirection. For decades, researchers have largely relied on brute-force mechanical methods. “Scientists dig into soil, they dig into water,” says de la Fuente. “And then from that complex organic matter they try to extract antimicrobial molecules.”

But molecules can be extraordinarily complex. Researchers have estimated the number of possible organic combinations that could be synthesized at somewhere around 1060. For reference, Earth contains an estimated 1018 grains of sand. “Drug discovery in any domain is a statistics game,” says Jonathan Stokes, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Canada, who has been using generative AI to design potential new antibiotics that can be synthesized in a lab, and who worked with Collins on halicin. “You need enough shots on goal to happen to get one.”

Those have to be good shots, though. And AI seems well suited to improving researchers’ aim. Biology is an information source, de la Fuente explains: “It’s like a bunch of code.” The code of DNA has four letters; proteins and peptides have 20, where each “letter” represents an amino acid. De la Fuente says his work amounts to training AI models to recognize sequences of letters that encode antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs. “If you think about it that way,” he says, “you can devise algorithms to mine the code and identify functional molecules, which can be antimicrobials. Or antimalarials. Or anticancer agents.”

Practically speaking, we’re still not there: These peptides haven’t yet been transformed into usable drugs that help people, and there are plenty of details—dosage, delivery, specific targets—that need to be sorted out, says de la Fuente. But AMPs are appealing because the body already uses them.They’re a critical part of the immune system and often the first line of defense against pathogenic infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have one trick for killing bacteria, AMPs often exhibit a multimodal approach. They may disrupt the cell wall and the genetic material inside as well as a variety of cellular processes. A bacterial pathogen may evolve resistance to a conventional drug’s single mode of action, but maybe not to a multipronged AMP attack.

De la Fuente’s group is one of many pushing the boundaries of using AI for antibiotics. Where he focuses primarily on peptides, Collins works on small-molecule discovery. So does Stokes, at McMaster, whose models identify promising new molecules and predict whether they can be synthesized. “It’s only been a few years since folks have been using AI meaningfully in drug discovery,” says Collins.

Even in that short time the tools have changed, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University, who has worked with Stokes and Collins. Researchers have moved from using predictive models to developing generative approaches. With a predictive approach, Zou says, researchers screen large libraries of candidates that are known to be promising. Generative approaches offer something else: the appeal of designing a new molecule from scratch. Last year, for example, de la Fuente’s team used one generative AI model to design a suite of synthetic peptides and another to assess them. The group tested two of the resulting compounds on mice infected with a drug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, a germ that the World Health Organization has identified as a “critical priority” in research on antimicrobial resistance. Both successfully and safely treated the infection.

But the field is still in the discovery phase. In his current work, de la Fuente is trying to get candidates closer to clinical testing. To that end, his team is developing an ambitious multimodal model called ApexOracle that’s designed to analyze a new pathogen, pinpoint its genetic weaknesses, match it to antimicrobial peptides that might work against it, and then predict how an antibiotic, built from those peptides, would fare in lab tests. It “converges understanding in chemistry, genomics, and language,” he says. It’s preliminary, he adds, but even if it doesn’t work perfectly, it will help steer the next generation of AI models toward the ultimate goal of resisting resistance.

Using AI, he believes, human researchers now have a fighting chance at catching up to the giant threat before them. The technology has already saved decades of human research time. Now he wants it to save lives, too: “This is the world that we live in today, and it’s incredible.”

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.”

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they’d carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren’t just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim’s window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone’s home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison’s and my radar, you’re going [down]. It’s just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you’re done.”

Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says.

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It’s an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement.

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim’s phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com’s impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence.

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There’s only so far that China is willing to go; there’s only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it’s just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com’s roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can’t get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records.

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it’s also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they’re untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I’ve made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn’t suppress her happiness when someone she’s been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company’s counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague’s dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters.

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim’s network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks.

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says.

She wasn’t bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don’t like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I’m willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn’t bother me.”

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them.

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted.

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she’d found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there’s all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn’t figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out.

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim’s phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors’ social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams.

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn’t seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn’t take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon’s skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she’d begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they’d eventually do something significant with that skill.

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker’s career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn’t until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn’t exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it’s an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon’s own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence.

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker’s handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker’s handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member’s name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes’ seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes.

At this point, Waifu still wasn’t on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu’s crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu’s group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account.

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon’s number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they’d stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn’t pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn’t helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn’t the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon’s process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She’d draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target’s enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka’s home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka’s house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu’s online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won’t say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don’t want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he’s alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.”

Prosecutors, who list Moucka’s online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial.

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly.

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu’s group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I’m just going to keep doing that until there’s no one left on that side.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">If you checked X today expecting the usual stream of hot takes, memes, and AI spats, you probably saw… nothing. A widespread outage hit the platform today, leaving feeds blank, timelines unresponsive, and users staring at the digital equivalent of an empty room.

Outage trackers such as Downdetector logged a dramatic surge in problem reports around midday GMT, with tens of thousands of users across regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and India, reporting problems accessing the service. Some described impossible login loops and error messages telling them only that “something went wrong.”

Here’s where it gets curious: nobody from X has confirmed why the platform hiccupped. Despite the scale of the disruption, and a global user base reliant on the service for everything from breaking news to weather alerts, there’s been no official timeline for a fix or even an acknowledgement of a broader issue. For a service that prides itself on instant updates, the silence is notable.

This isn’t the first time X has ground to a halt. The platform has a history of outages since its rebranding from Twitter, with users historically greeted by messages like “Something went wrong” when backend systems hiccup.

Today’s disruption even impacted associated tech. Reports suggest that Grok, the AI chatbot tied into X’s ecosystem, also faced interruptions as timelines failed to load, underscoring how much of the platform’s experience still depends on backend stability.

For now, the outage remains a developing story, and users left refreshing their browsers might be asking the most modern question of all: was it a bug, a server gremlin, or just another Monday on X?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I need to say something that might make CS leaders uncomfortable: most of what your team does before a renewal is valuable, but it’s listening to only one channel. Your EBRs, your health scores, your stakeholder maps. They capture what your customer is willing to tell you directly. What they don’t capture is the conversation happening everywhere else. And that’s usually where churn starts.

I know because I ran the standard playbook for years. EBRs, stakeholder mapping, health score reviews, and renewal prep meetings, where we rated our gut feeling on a scale of green to red. We had dashboards. We had strong CSMs who genuinely cared about their accounts. And we still got blindsided.

The $2M quarter is the one I can’t forget. Two enterprise accounts churned in the same 90-day window. Both were green in every system we had. One had an NPS of 72.

When I dug into what happened, I didn’t find a CS execution problem. I found a coverage gap. Every signal had been there. Just not in the places our process was designed to look. I sat in the post-mortem knowing we’d done everything our process asked us to do. That was the problem.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Later in this article, I’ll show you what both of those accounts would have looked like inside Renewal Fix. Before anyone on my team knew there was a problem.

I’m not saying EBRs are useless. A well-run EBR builds relationship depth, gives your champion ammunition internally, and surfaces problems the customer is willing to raise directly. But even the best EBR has a structural limitation: it only captures what someone chooses to say out loud, in a meeting, to a vendor.

The real conversation about your product is happening in a Slack channel you’ll never see, in a procurement review you weren’t invited to, and in a 1:1 between your champion and their new boss who just joined from a company that used your competitor. The EBR gives you one essential channel. The danger is treating it as the only one.

Here’s what was actually happening in those two accounts that churned on me.

Account one: their engineering team had filed 23 support tickets about API latency over four months. Not “the product is broken” tickets. Small, specific, technical complaints that got resolved individually. Nobody in CS ever saw them because they never escalated to “critical.” But lined up chronologically, the pattern was unmistakable: this team was losing patience, one resolved ticket at a time.

Account two: three of their five power users updated their LinkedIn profiles in the same two-week window. One started posting about a competitor’s product. Our champion’s title changed from “Head of” to “Senior Manager.” A quiet demotion nobody noticed because we were watching product usage dashboards, not org charts.

Every CS leader I know has lost an account and later found out the champion left months ago. The customer’s reaction is always the same: “We assumed you knew.” They expect you to track publicly available professional changes, the same information any recruiter monitors. Not tracking them isn’t respectful. It’s a blind spot.

Neither signal lived in our CRM. Neither showed up in our health score. They were sitting in plain sight in systems our CS team had no reason to check.

Health scores aren’t the problem. Treating them as the whole picture is. A typical health score aggregates NPS, login frequency, support ticket count, and feature adoption. Green means safe. Red means act. But these are lagging indicators. By the time login frequency drops, the decision to evaluate alternatives may already be in motion.

When I started tracking leading indicators alongside our existing health model, the difference was striking. Across roughly 300 mid-market accounts over 18 months, we found that support ticket velocity, specifically the rate of increase in non-critical tickets over a rolling 90-day window, predicted churn at T-90 at roughly 2x the accuracy of our composite health score. The signals that actually predict churn aren’t the ones most CS platforms are designed to track.

The teams with the strongest renewal rates don’t abandon their existing processes. They add a signal layer on top. The highest-signal sources break into three tiers.

Tier 1: Support ticket patterns. Not the count, but the velocity, the sentiment trend, and whether the same team keeps filing. A steady trickle of “resolved” tickets from one engineering team is often a louder signal than a single P1 escalation. At scale, this becomes cohort-level complaint clustering across a segment.

Tier 2: People changes. Champion turnover, re-orgs, title changes, and new executives from a competitor’s customer base. The person who bought your product and the person renewing it are often not the same person. At scale, you’re watching for patterns of org instability across your book.

Tier 3: Competitive exposure. Whether your customer is being actively pitched, attending competitor events, or has team members engaging with competitor content online. At scale, you’re tracking which segments your competitors are targeting hardest.

The real challenge isn’t knowing what to track. It’s that these signals live in five or six different systems, and nobody’s job is to stitch them together. Your CSM sees Zendesk. Your SE sees Jira. Your AE sees Salesforce. The full picture only exists if someone manually assembles it.

One team I worked with built a manual version of this: CSMs logging signals from six different sources every Friday. About 90 minutes per account per week. Their renewal rate hit 96%. But the approach doesn’t scale past a 25-account book.

At 80 accounts in a mid-market motion, you need automation. At 150+ in a PLG model, the signals are still there, you’re watching for cohort-level drops in feature adoption or clusters of the same complaint across a segment, but you cannot find them without automation.

The teams doing this manually are logging into six tools every Friday. The teams doing this with automation get a Slack message when something changes. No dashboard to check. No Friday ritual.

Detection without a playbook is just anxiety. The point of catching signals early isn’t to panic. It’s to have time to act. An executive sponsor who hasn’t logged in for 90 days needs a different intervention than an account with a competitor POC in their Salesforce sandbox. The signal tells you what’s happening. The response has to match.

That gap between knowing what to track and actually tracking it consistently is why I built Renewal Fix. Not to replace the manual process, but to remove the ceiling on it. The platform pulls signals from support tickets, call recordings, CRM data, and engineering channels automatically, stitches them into a single account view, and flags them before they become a renewal surprise.

Enter your work email at renewalfix.com. In 30 seconds, you’ll get a one-page executive brief showing your blind spots: 10 accounts that look like they belong in your CS platform, built from your company’s products, competitive landscape, and integration stack, each with a health score and risk signals sourced from support tickets, call recordings, and org changes that your current dashboard would never surface. No demo, no sales call.

Find the account that looks most like Account One. Health score in the 70s, risk signals hiding underneath. Then click “Executive Brief” for a one-page summary of your portfolio’s total risk exposure, with dollar amounts and prioritized actions. That view is what Renewal Fix delivers weekly in production.

Your green accounts aren’t necessarily at risk. But they might be quieter than you realize.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, Peter Steinberger was experimenting with a side project that quickly caught fire across the developer world. His open-source AI assistant, OpenClaw, wasn’t just another chatbot; it could act on your behalf, from managing emails to integrating with calendars and messaging platforms.

Today, that project has a new chapter: Steinberger is joining OpenAI to help build the next generation of personal AI agents.

This move isn’t just about talent acquisition. It marks a switch in how the AI industry thinks about assistants: from reactive systems you talk to, toward agents that take initiative and perform tasks autonomously, with potential implications for productivity, workflows, and personal automation.

OpenClaw first emerged in late 2025 under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot. What distinguished it was not fancy visuals or marketing, but its practical ambition: give users an AI that connects to their tools and executes workflows, booking flights, sorting messages, scheduling meetings, in ways that feel closer to agency than assistant.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It quickly went viral on GitHub, drawing more than 100,000 stars and millions of visits to its project page within weeks.

Rather than turning OpenClaw into a standalone company, Steinberger chose to partner with OpenAI, a decision he explained in a blog post as driven by a simple goal: bring intelligent agents to a broader audience as quickly as possible.

According to him, OpenAI’s infrastructure, research resources, and product ecosystem offered the best path to scale such an ambitious idea.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman welcomed Steinberger’s move as strategic, underscoring that the company expects personal agents, systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and completing tasks across apps, to be an important part of future AI products.

Altman’s public post noted that OpenClaw will continue to exist as an open-source project under a new foundation supported by OpenAI, preserving its accessibility and community roots.

The notion of AI that does things has been bubbling under the surface of tech discourse, but OpenClaw’s popularity crystallised it. Users interact with their agents through familiar interfaces like messaging platforms, but behind the scenes, these agents orchestrate API calls, automate scripts, handle notifications, and adapt to changing schedules, all without explicit commands after initial setup.

This trajectory, from an experimental open-source project to a central piece of a major AI lab’s strategy, speaks to broader trends in the industry. Competitors from Anthropic to Google DeepMind have also indicated interest in multi-agent systems and autonomous workflows, but OpenAI’s move signals how seriously the category is now being taken.

It suggests a future where AI isn’t just conversational, but proactive and tightly integrated into everyday tooling.

At the same time, this evolution raises fresh questions about governance and safety. OpenClaw’s open-source nature meant that developers could experiment freely, but that freedom also exposed potential attack surfaces; misconfigured agents with access to sensitive accounts or automation processes could be exploited if not properly safeguarded.

That is one reason why maintaining an open foundation with careful oversight matters as these tools scale.

For OpenAI, Steinberger’s arrival embeds this agent-first thinking into its product roadmap at a critical moment. The company is already exploring “multi-agent” architectures, where specialised AIs coordinate with each other and with users to handle complex tasks more effectively than monolithic models alone. Steinberger brings an experimental sensibility and real-world experience that could accelerate those efforts.

This could mean future versions of ChatGPT or other OpenAI products will be able to carry out tasks you define, rather than waiting for you to prompt them. That shift, from conversational replies to autonomous action, is the next frontier in how AI will fit into daily digital life.

And with OpenClaw’s creator now inside one of the most influential AI labs in the world, that future feels closer than ever.

            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <h2>Anthropic’s $30B raise is about more than money</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/anthropics-30b-raise-is-about-more-than-money">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.
