            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/attached-to-tragedy-tracing-challenger-remove-before-flight-tags/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forty years ago, a stack of bright red tags shared a physical connection with what would become NASA’s first space shuttle disaster. The small tags, however, were collected before the ill-fated launch of Challenger, as was instructed in bold “Remove Before Flight” lettering on the front of each.

What happened to the tags after that is largely unknown.

This is an attempt to learn more about where those “Remove Before Flight” tags went after they were detached from the space shuttle and before they arrived on my doorstep. If their history can be better documented, they can be provided to museums, educational centers, and astronautical archives for their preservation and display.

To begin, we go back 16 years to when they were offered for sale on eBay.

The advertisement on the auction website was titled “Space Shuttle Remove Before Flight Flags Lot of 18.” They were listed with an opening bid of $3.99. On January 12, 2010, I paid $5.50 as the winner.

At that point, my interest in the 3-inch-wide by 12-inch-long (7.6 by 30.5 cm) tags was as handouts for kids and other attendees at future events. Whether it was at an astronaut autograph convention, a space memorabilia show, a classroom visit, or a conference talk, having “swag” was a great way to foster interest in space history. At first glance, these flags seemed to be a perfect fit.

So I didn’t pay much attention when they first arrived. The eBay listing had promoted them only as generic examples of “KSC Form 4-226 (6/77)&quot;—the ID the Kennedy Space Center assigned to the tags. There was no mention of their being used, let alone specifying an orbiter or specific flight. If I recall correctly, the seller said his intention had been to use them on his boat.

(Attempts to retrieve the original listing for this article were unsuccessful. As an eBay spokesperson said, “eBay does not retain transaction records or item details dating back over a decade, and therefore we do not have any information to share with you.”)

It was about a year later when I first noticed the ink stamps at the bottom of each tag. They were marked “ET-26” followed by a number. For example, the first tag in the clipped-together stack was stamped “ET-26-000006.”

“ET” refers to the External Tank. The largest components of the space shuttle stack, the burnt orange or brown tanks were numbered, so 26 had to be one of the earlier missions of the 30-year, 135-flight program.

A fact sheet prepared by Lockheed Martin provided the answer. The company operated at the Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, where the external tanks were built before being barged to the Kennedy Space Center for launch. Part of the sheet listed each launch with its date and numbered external tank. As my finger traced down the page, it came to STS 61-B, 11/26/85, ET-22; STS 61-C, 1/12/86, ET-30; and then STS 51-L, 1/28/86… ET-26.

To be clear, the tags had no role in the loss of Challenger or its crew, including commander Dick Scobee; pilot Mike Smith; mission specialists Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik, and Ellison Onizuka; payload specialist Gregory Jarvis; and Teacher-in-Space Christa McAuliffe. Although the structural failure of the external tank ultimately resulted in Challenger breaking apart, it was a compromised O-ring seal in one of the shuttle’s two solid rocket boosters that allowed hot gas to burn through, impinging the tank.

Further, although it’s still unknown when the tags and their associated ground support equipment (e.g., protective covers, caps) were removed, it was not within hours of the launch, and in many cases, it was completed well before the vehicle reached the pad.

“They were removed later in processing at different times but definitely all done before propellant loading,” said Mike Cianilli, the former manager of NASA’s Apollo, Challenger, Columbia Lessons Learned Program. “To make sure they were gone, final walkdowns and closeouts by the ground crews confirmed removal.”

According to NASA, approximately 20 percent of ET-26 was recovered from the ocean floor after the tragedy, and like the parts of the solid rocket boosters and Challenger, they were placed into storage in two retired missile silos at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (today, Space Force Station). Components removed from the vehicle before the ill-fated launch that were no longer needed likely went through the normal surplus processes as overseen by the General Services Administration, said Cianilli.

Once the tags’ association with STS-51L was confirmed, it no longer felt right to use them as giveaways. At least, not to individuals.

There are very few items directly connected to Challenger‘s last flight that museums and other public centers can use to connect their visitors to what transpired 40 years ago. NASA has placed only one piece of Challenger on public display, and that is in the exhibition “Forever Remembered” at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

Each of the 50 US states, the Smithsonian, and the president of the United States were also presented with a small American flag and a mission patch that had been aboard Challenger at the time of the tragedy.

Having a more complete history of these tags would help meet the accession requirements of some museums and, if approved, provide curators with the information they need to put the tags on display.

When the tags were first identified, contacts at NASA and Lockheed, among others, were unable to explain how they ended up on eBay and, ultimately, with me.

It was 2011, and the space shuttle program was coming to its end. I was politely told that this was not the time to ask about the tags, as documents were being moved into archives and, perhaps more importantly, people were more concerned about pending layoffs. One person suggested the tags be put back in a drawer and forgotten about for another decade.

In the years since, other “Remove Before Flight” tags from other space shuttle missions have come up for sale. Some have included evidence that the tags had passed through the surplus procedures; some did not and were offered as is.

There were anecdotes about outgoing employees taking home mementos. Maybe someone saw these tags heading out as scrap (or worse, being tossed in the garbage) and, recognizing what they were, saved them from being lost to history. An agent with the NASA Office of Inspector General once said that dumpster diving was not prohibited, so long as the item(s) being dived for were not metal (due to recycling).

More recent attempts to reach people who might know anything about the specific tags have been unsuccessful, other than the few details Cianilli was able to share. An attempt to recontact the eBay seller has so far gone unanswered.

If you or someone you know worked on the external tank at the time of the STS-51L tragedy, or if you’re familiar with NASA’s practices regarding installing, retrieving, and archiving or disposing of the Remove Before Flight tags, please get in contact.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google began stuffing Gemini into its dominant Chrome browser several months ago, and today the AI is expanding its capabilities considerably. Google says the chatbot will be easier to access and connect to more Google services, but the biggest change is the addition of Google’s autonomous browsing agent, which it has dubbed Auto Browse. Similar to tools like OpenAI Atlas, Auto Browse can handle tedious tasks in Chrome so you don’t have to.

The newly unveiled Gemini features in Chrome are accessible from the omnipresent AI button that has been lurking at the top of the window for the last few months. Initially, that button only opened Gemini in a pop-up window, but Google now says it will default to a split-screen or “Sidepanel” view. Google confirmed the update began rolling out over the past week, so you may already have it.

You can still pop Gemini out into a floating window, but the split-view gives Gemini more room to breathe while manipulating a page with AI. This is also helpful when calling other apps in the Chrome implementation of Gemini. The chatbot can now access Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights right from the Chrome window. Google technically added this feature around the middle of January, but it’s only talking about it now.

Gemini in Chrome can now also access and edit images with Nano Banana, so you don’t have to download and re-upload them to Gemini in another location. Just open the image from the web and type in the Sidepanel with a description of the edits you want. Like in the Gemini app, you can choose between the slower but higher-quality Pro model and the faster standard one.

Chrome’s new browsing agent (in preview) is the star of today’s show. The promise of agentic AI is one of the freedom to be lazy. Rather than filling out forms or copying information from emails, you simply task a robot with the job and relax while it goes to work. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to go. Most of the computer-use agents we’ve seen so far have been sluggish and unreliable enough to require human supervision. That kind of defeats the purpose. Now it’s Google’s turn to show us what its browsing agent can do.

Google says Auto Browse is based on its latest Gemini 3 models, with input from the company’s work on the experimental Project Mariner agent. If you’d do something with a keyboard and mouse inside your browser, Auto Browse is theoretically able to take over. It can also access the content and tabs in your browser, asking for permission when it needs sensitive data, such as your passwords.

When you launch an Auto Browse task, Chrome will open new tabs as necessary and mark them with a sparkly AI icon so you know where the robot is active. You don’t have to keep that tab in the foreground, and you can even have multiple AI tasks going at once. The AI will ping you to check in when the task is done or when it needs your input. However, there are limits on Auto Browse similar to some of the company’s more computationally intensive chatbot functions. AI Pro subscribers get 20 AI browsing tasks per day, but those paying for AI Ultra get 200 per day.

Having the AI churning in the background may be a concern—after all, generative AI can make mistakes, and you are giving it complete control over the browsing experience. Google says it has implemented a range of security and safety rules to prevent misuse. For example, if you ask Auto Browse to research and buy something, it won’t actually buy it. Instead, it will find the item (hopefully) and progress to the purchase screen before letting you pull the trigger manually.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Auto Browse doesn’t run locally. All content from your robotically operated tab is streamed to a cloud-based Gemini model. That means page content will be shared with Google, but the extent is not entirely clear. Google says Auto Browse is governed by the established Gemini in Chrome policy, which says Google stores information from websites in the Gemini Apps Activity (if Keep Activity is enabled). Page content is also “logged to your Google Account temporarily.” We asked if Google would use page contents processed by Auto Browse to further train AI models, but a spokesperson declined to provide specifics.

Chrome Auto Browse is rolling out today in preview, but it’s not exactly free. It won’t cost anything extra, but the feature is limited to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. Google’s language suggests the feature may come to free users after the preview phase, but we’d expect strict usage limits.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/meta-blocks-links-to-ice-list-across-facebook-instagram-and-threads/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta has started blocking its users from sharing links to ICE List, a website that has compiled the names of what it claims are Department of Homeland Security employees, a project the creators say is designed to hold those employees accountable.

Dominick Skinner, the creator of ICE List, tells WIRED that links to the website have been shared without issue on Meta’s platforms for more than six months.

“I think it’s no surprise that a company run by a man who sat behind Trump at his inauguration, and donated to the destruction of the White House, has taken a stance that helps ICE agents retain anonymity,” says Skinner.

As agents from Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which are under DHS, have continued to terrorize immigrant communities and kill US citizens, activists have sought to track and record their activity online in a bid to hold them accountable. But as well as threatening to prosecute those they claim are “doxing” ICE agents, the Trump administration has pressured tech companies to block any efforts at crowdsourcing the location and activities of those agents.

ICE List has been operating since last June. Skinner says it is run by a core team of five people, including him, as well as hundreds of anonymous volunteers who share information about ICE agents operating in cities across the US.

The site went viral earlier this month when it claimed to have uploaded a leaked list of 4,500 DHS employees to its site, but a WIRED analysis found that the list relied heavily on information the employees shared publicly about themselves on sites such as LinkedIn.

Skinner said volunteers he works with across the US first reported problems with posting links on Meta’s platforms on Monday night.

On Tuesday morning, WIRED verified that posting links to the site was blocked on Instagram, Facebook, and Threads. WIRED also confirmed that links can still be sent on WhatsApp, another Meta-owned product.

While all the social media platforms where the link is blocked are owned by Meta, the reasons users are given for their inability to link to the ICE List website vary.

When WIRED attempted to post a link on Facebook, we received a message that read: “Posts that look like spam according to our Community Guidelines are blocked on Facebook and can’t be edited.” Hours later, however, that message was updated to read: “Your content couldn’t be shared, because this link goes against our Community Standards.” The message linked to Meta’s Community Standards homepage rather than a specific part of those rules.

Meanwhile on Threads, the link instantly disappeared when pasted into a new post, with a notice simply saying: “Link not allowed.”

On Instagram, a notice appearing after an attempt to post a Story read: “We restrict certain activity to protect our community. Let us know if you think we made a mistake.”

When asked about the block, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone directed WIRED to the company’s policy about sharing personally identifiable information. When WIRED pointed out that the information on the ICE List did not appear to contain any of the information listed on Meta’s policy, he said it was in relation to the policy prohibiting “content asking for personally identifiable information of others.”

In response, Skinner pointed out that ICE List has been asking for tips about the identities of ICE agents for six months.

            <h2>Report: China approves import of high-end Nvidia AI chips after weeks of uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/report-china-approves-import-of-high-end-nvidia-ai-chips-after-weeks-of-uncertainty/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, China approved imports of Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence chips for three of its largest technology companies, Reuters reported. ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent received approval to purchase more than 400,000 H200 chips in total, marking a shift in Beijing’s stance after weeks of holding up shipments despite US export clearance.

The move follows Beijing’s temporary halt to H200 shipments earlier this month after Washington cleared exports on January 13. Chinese customs authorities had told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month, even as Chinese technology companies placed orders for more than two million of the chips.

The H200, Nvidia’s second most powerful AI chip after the B200, delivers roughly six times the performance of the company’s H20 chip, which was previously the most capable chip Nvidia could sell to China. While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the H20’s performance, they still lag far behind the H200.

Chinese tech giants want access to Nvidia’s higher-powered AI chips because they dramatically speed up the process of training large AI models, a computationally intensive task of feeding data through neural networks millions of times to tune their performance. More capable chips like the H200 allow companies to train larger models faster or run more AI queries (called inference) at a lower cost.

This has made high-end AI accelerator chips a flashpoint in the ongoing AI race between Washington, DC, and Beijing, with US policymakers caught between wanting to boost sales for American semiconductor companies and fearing that exports could help China close the gap in AI capabilities.

Still, Nvidia wants the business because China is a huge market. The latest approvals came during Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s visit to China this week, according to sources who spoke with Reuters on the condition of anonymity. Other Chinese firms are now waiting for their own approvals in future rounds, though Beijing is attaching conditions to the licenses that have not yet been finalized. One source told Reuters that the license terms were too restrictive and buyers had not yet turned their approvals into actual orders.

The approval signals Beijing’s prioritization of its major Internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centers needed to develop AI services and compete with US rivals, including OpenAI. But regulators are also trying to nurture China’s domestic semiconductor industry, the South China Morning Post reported.

The first batch was expected to go to Big Tech companies in urgent need of the GPU, according to a source who spoke with that publication. However, access for state-backed firms, including telecom operators, was expected to stay tightly restricted.

Beijing has previously discouraged domestic technology companies from purchasing foreign chips unless absolutely needed, according to earlier Reuters reporting. One proposal authorities discussed in the past would require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a set ratio of domestic chips.

“Beijing’s approval of the H200 is driven by purely strategic motives,” Alex Capri, a senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore’s business school, told the South China Morning Post. “Ultimately, this decision is taken to further China’s indigenous capabilities and, by extension, the competitive capabilities of China tech.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/sc-measles-23-schools-hit-over-550-quarantined-as-outbreak-hits-record/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The explosive measles outbreak in South Carolina has now reached 789 cases, breaking Texas’s outbreak record last year of 762 cases, which at the time was the largest outbreak in the US since measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000. The country is at grave risk of losing its elimination status in the coming months due to continuous spread.

With Texas’ outbreak last year—which spanned January to August and spread to additional states—the US saw the largest measles case total since 1991, with 2,255 confirmed cases. Now, with South Carolina’s unbridled outbreak, 2026 is already looking like it will be another record year.

Though South Carolina’s outbreak began in October, the spread of the disease has dramatically accelerated this month, with cases jumping from 218 on December 28 to 789 on January 27.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting a national tally of 416 confirmed cases since the start of the year, but the total was last updated on January 22, missing the latest cases, including the 89 South Carolina cases reported Tuesday.

In addition to South Carolina, measles cases for 2026 have been reported in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. A large outbreak of the highly infectious virus is ongoing at the border of Utah and Arizona. Collectively, the states have reported 457 cases amid the outbreak, including 66 reported in 2026.

Measles is one of the most infectious viruses we know of and can linger in the airspace of a room for up to two hours after an infected person has been present. Among unvaccinated people exposed to an infectious person, up to 90 percent will become ill. Many infections are only identified when measles’ telltale rash develops, but a person can be infectious for four days before that rash develops, allowing the virus to more easily spread. People remain infectious for four days after the rash appears. In newly infected people, symptoms, which also include high fevers, typically begin 7 to 14 days after exposure, but this incubation period can be as long as 21 days, which is the length of quarantine.

In its latest update, South Carolina’s Public Health Department reported data indicating that its large case jumps will continue. In recent weeks, officials have identified 23 schools where measles has been unleashed. In 20 of the schools, unvaccinated and exposed students have been identified and quarantined, with individual schools’ quarantine totals spanning 13 to 59 students. For the remaining three schools with exposures, officials are still determining how many students need to be quarantined.

State officials have also identified eight public places where measles exposures have occurred recently, including grocery stores, a US Post Office, and a skating center.

For now, 557 students are quarantined, but additional susceptible people have likely been exposed.

Among the 789 cases, 769 (97 percent) were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated or had an undocumented vaccination status. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles, and that protection is considered lifelong.</div>

            <h2>Ryzen 9850X3D review: AMD's bragging-rights gaming CPU gets more to brag about</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/review-amds-ryzen-7-9850x3d-is-a-little-faster-and-a-lot-more-power-hungry/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AMD has released three distinct generations of its 3D V-Cache technology, which initially appeared in the Ryzen 7 5800X3D in 2022. The kernel of the idea has remained the same throughout AMD’s efforts: take an existing desktop processor design and graft 64MB of additional L3 cache onto it.

This approach disproportionately helps apps that benefit from more cache, particularly games, and the size of the boost that 3D V-Cache gives to game performance has always been enough to offset any downsides these chips have come with. In the four years since the 5800X3D was released, AMD also has steadily chipped away at those disadvantages, adding more CPU cores, improving power consumption and temperatures, and re-adding the typical Ryzen range of overclocking controls.

AMD’s new Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which launches for $499 starting tomorrow, is the very definition of a mild upgrade. It’s the year-old Ryzen 7 9800X3D but with an extra 400 MHz of turbo boost speed. That’s it. That’s the chip.

But it is mildly interesting that the 9800X3D’s 5.6GHz boost clock is now 100 MHz higher than that of the Ryzen 7 9700X, the chip’s nearest non-V-Cache equivalent. It’s not nearly as interesting as an actual new chip, but it does mean AMD has closed the last major functional gap between the V-Cache and non-V-Cache Ryzen chips (the pricing gap remains; the 9700X currently retails for around $329).

It also means that the 9850X3D behaves more like a 9700X in other ways—differences that likely won’t matter to its target audience but which do distinguish it from being “just a faster 9800X3D.”

The biggest change AMD made to the Ryzen 9000 version of the X3D chips is that the 3D V-Cache is now stacked underneath the CPU silicon rather than on top. This has the benefit of moving the CPU cores closer to your heatsink or AIO loop, making them easier to keep cool.

The 9850X3D remains an eight-core chip based on AMD’s Zen 5 architecture. All eight of those CPU cores have access to the 3D V-Cache, unlike the 12-core and 16-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D. In each of those chips, one of the CPU chiplets has access to the 3D V-Cache and one doesn’t; AMD’s chipset software is responsible for making sure apps run on the type of CPU core that will maximize the app’s performance. AMD’s software is pretty good at this, but it’s not foolproof, which can make the 9800X3D and 9850X3D more appealing and cost-effective options for PCs that will mainly be used for gaming.

The specs in our CPU testbed are the same as they’ve been for a while. We’ll be focused on comparing the 9850X3D to its predecessors, the 5800X3D, 7800X3D, and 9800X3D, as well as the non-V-Cache 7700X and 9700X. We’ll also include numbers from the higher-end 9900X3D and 9950X3D. Intel’s side of the fence will be represented by the Core Ultra 9 285K and the last few generations of Core i9 chips, though Intel has yet to release any chips that are truly performance-competitive with the 3D V-Cache chips in gaming workloads.

Though our testbed continues to rely on DDR5-6000, AMD’s slide deck takes the current (horrible) state of the RAM market into account. While DDR5-6000 or DDR5-6400 is generally still the performance sweet spot for all socket AM5 CPUs, AMD notes that game performance between the 9850X3D with DDR5-6000 and the same chip with DDR5-4800 can be as little as 1 to 2 percent. In other words, pair whatever RAM you can find with this chip and don’t worry about it too much.

The first thing to notice about the 9850X3D is that its multi-core performance is essentially indistinguishable from the 9800X3D. If anything, the 9800X3D seems marginally better behaved in our Handbrake video encoding tests, which could come down to anything or nothing—maybe it’s an actual difference between the chips, maybe it’s the silicon lottery, maybe it’s something else. Overall, it’s mostly a wash.

The 9850X3D does improve significantly on the 9800X3D’s single-core performance, closing the gap with both the Ryzen 9900X3D and 9950X3D (both of which have regular Zen 5 cores with no 3D V-Cache) and the 9700X (which has no 3D V-Cache at all).

There’s a world in which AMD can get this extra performance for “free” without changing anything about the architecture or manufacturing process. AMD could have been “binning” silicon lottery winners, or the reliability of the manufacturing process could have improved enough to allow AMD to hit better numbers that weren’t as consistently achievable a year ago.

But it looks like AMD improved the 9850X3D’s single-core performance mainly by making it behave more like a non-X3D chip. The chip’s power consumption while gaming suggests this is more or less what’s happening—the 9850X3D’s CPU package power while gaming is some 25 or 30 W higher than the 9800X3D playing the same games, despite the single-digit-at-best performance improvement (in both our testing and AMD’s advertising).

While the 9850X3D’s power consumption while gaming isn’t wildly out of step with the 9700X’s or the 9950X3D’s, it does make the tiny performance gains on display here hard to get excited about.

And this is on top of the cost trade-off you’re already making when you buy an X3D-series chip. Game performance is always impressive, but you notice those benefits the most in situations where your CPU, not the GPU, is the performance bottleneck.

Most of the time in a gaming PC, that’s only going to be the case when you’re trying to play games at extremely high frame rates at lower resolutions. It’s less useful when trying to play games at 4K or even 1440p, where your graphics card will be the limiter. If you’re building a system around any GPU slower than an RTX 4080 or 5080, going with a regular 9700X and putting the savings toward your GPU (or toward an eye-wateringly expensive RAM kit) will usually be a better use of funds.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D mostly does what it says it does: It’s a mild speed bump to AMD’s best gaming processor that, in most cases, very slightly extends the company’s performance lead over Intel chips like the Core Ultra 9 285K.

But the vanilla 9800X3D is almost as fast, uses 25 or 30 W less power during gaming (which also results in temperatures that are 10° to 15° Celsius cooler), and is $30 cheaper as of this writing.

As someone who routinely runs his own Ryzen desktop chips in Eco Mode to reduce power consumption and temperatures and hit a more efficient spot on the performance-per-Watt curve, the numbers that the 9850X3D posted in our testing make it seem like an undesirable trade-off, even if you’re in the target market for a fast-as-possible, money’s-no-object, bragging-rights gaming PC.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We all know that tech companies keep tabs on everything about our online habits. But it’s another thing to actually be confronted with just how much data they have on you.

This was the experience of tech journalist Pranav Dixit, who experimented with using Google’s new “Personal Intelligence” feature for Gemini and its search engine’s AI Mode. And boy, did things get personal. The AI was able to dig up everything from his license plate to his parents’ vacation history, sometimes without it being directly requested.

“Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook,” Dixit wrote in a piece for Business Insider.

Google rolled out Personal Intelligence to subscribers of Google AI Pro and AI Ultra last week. Once you opt in, the AI can scour your Gmail and Google Photos accounts, and a more powerful version released for the Gemini app earlier this month goes even deeper, raking your Search and YouTube history, too. In short, if you’ve ever used Google for anything, it can probably dig it up.

This represents one way Google intends to keep its edge in the AI race. Unlike competitors such as OpenAI, it has decades’ worth of user data on billions of people. It can infer plenty from your Google searches alone, and your Gmail account is probably littered with confirmations and reminders for all kinds of life events, ranging from doctor’s appointments to hotel bookings to online purchases.

If the idea of letting an AI prowl through all this sounds like a privacy nightmare to you, you’re probably not wrong. Google, for its part, maintains that it’s being careful with your personal secrets, with VP Josh Woodward insisting in a recent blog post that it only trains its AI on your prompts and the responses they generate — not stuff like your photos and emails.

“We don’t train our systems to learn your license plate number,” he summarized. “We train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it.”

Whatever the ethics, Dixit’s estimation is that giving the AI access to your data at least makes for a genuinely useful — and “scary-good,” in his phrasing — personal assistant.

When asked to come up with some sightseeing ideas for his parents, Personal Intelligence correctly inferred that they’d already done plenty of hikes on previous trips to the Bay Area, and suggested some museums and gardens instead.

Gemini told Dixit that it had deduced this from “breadcrumbs” including emails, photos of a forest they trekked in, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for “easy hikes for seniors.” It also figured out his license plate number based on photos stored in his Google library and scanned his emails to correctly report when his car insurance was up for renewal.

Privacy isn’t the only concern that the feature raises. With the data, chatbots can sound more humanlike, giving the impression that they’re intimately familiar with users’ personal lives. This is a dangerous road to go down amid reports of many people falling down delusional mental health spirals as they come to believe the AIs are trustworthy companions; Dixit touches on this when he complains about how’d he’d “pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer,” only for it to “forget I existed like a genius goldfish.” Experts have focused on ChatGPT’s “memory” as allowing it to seem too lifelike by drawing on what you’ve said in previous conversations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, tech companies have relied immensely on India’s vast workforce, from entry-level call center jobs to software engineers and high-ranking managerial positions.

But with the advent of advanced AI, which has been accompanied by employers greatly cutting back on hiring with the hopes of eventually automating tasks entirely, India’s tech workers are having to cope with a vastly different reality in 2026.

As Rest of World reports, rising anxiety over the influence of AI, on top of already-grueling 90-hour workweeks, has proven devastating for workers. While it’s hard to single out a definitive cause, a troubling wave of suicides among tech workers highlights these unsustainable conditions.

Complicating the picture is a lack of clear government data on the tragic deaths. While it’s impossible to tell whether they are more prevalent among IT workers, experts told Rest of World that the mental health situation in the tech industry is nonetheless “very alarming.”

The prospect of AI making their careers redundant is a major stressor, with tech workers facing a “huge uncertainty about their jobs,” as Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur senior professor of computer science and engineering Jayanta Mukhopadhyay told Rest of World.

While there are likely a compounding number of reasons why the United States has seen major job cuts, experts point out that entry-level jobs are at the highest risk. India’s IT industry has also been particularly vulnerable, as companies clamor to invest in AI with the hopes of cutting costs by replacing jobs like customer service representatives.

“The traditional consulting role in the service industry is going to be impacted much, much more than traditional product-development companies,” Cornell University IT assistant professor Aditya Vashistha told Rest of World.

Meanwhile, educational institutions in India are continuing to churn out graduates, compounding the issue as jobs become scarcer. India’s biggest private sector employer cut almost 20,000 jobs late last year, indicative of a much broader trend.

Those who remain employed are put under intense pressure to keep innovating. Many of them struggle to separate work from their personal lives. Extended hours and isolation arising from having to work around the clock and across time zones only worsen the situation.

On top of that is the constant threat of being made obsolete by AI, which has driven many workers identified by Rest of World to the brink — and in some cases, over the edge.

It’s a horrifying new trend, highlighting the humanitarian cost of mass layoffs and major technological shifts reshaping roles across industries.

Employers in India, much like many of their counterparts in the US, are tied up in a battle of adapting to a new world order determined by AI — or be left behind.

Even then, the prospects of being employed in IT in the country aren’t looking great.

“The number of people required to work in IT services in the world of AI will be orders of magnitude lower than where we are currently,” Marcellus Investment Managers founder and chief investment officer Saurabh Mukherjea told CNBC earlier this month.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI tech leaders have a lot to gain from striking fear into the hearts of their investors. By painting the tech as an ultra-powerful force that could easily bring humanity to its knees, the industry is hoping to sell itself as a panacea: a remedy to a situation it had a firm hand in bringing about.

Case in point, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei is back with a 19,000-word essay posted to his blog, arguing that “humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.”

In light of that existential danger, Amodei attempted to lay out a framework to “defeat” the risks presented by AI — which, by his own admission, may well be “futile.”

“Humanity needs to wake up, and this essay is an attempt — a possibly futile one, but it’s worth trying — to jolt people awake,” he wrote.

Amodei argued that “we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023,” citing the risks of major job losses and a “concentration of economic power” and wealth.

However, the incentives to invest in meaningful guardrails simply aren’t there. In his essay, Amodei took a thinly-veiled dig at Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot, which has been swept up in a major controversy over creating nonconsensual sexual images.

“Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models,” he wrote.

The CEO also cited the risk of AIs developing dangerous bioweapons or “superior” military weapons. An AI could “go rogue and overpower humanity” or allow countries to “use their advantage in AI to gain power over other countries,” leading to the “alarming possibility of a global totalitarian dictatorship.”

Amodei lamented that we simply aren’t willing to address these risks head-on, at least right now. In its current race to the bottom, the AI industry finds itself in a “trap,” Amodei argued.

“AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilization to impose any restraints on it at all,” he wrote.

“Taking time to carefully build AI systems so they do not autonomously threaten humanity is in genuine tension with the need for democratic nations to stay ahead of authoritarian nations and not be subjugated by them,” he wrote. “But in turn, the same AI-enabled tools that are necessary to fight autocracies can, if taken too far, be turned inward to create tyranny in our own countries.”

“AI-driven terrorism could kill millions through the misuse of biology, but an overreaction to this risk could lead us down the road to an autocratic surveillance state,” he argued.

As part of a solution, Amodei renewed his calls to deny other countries the resources to build powerful AI. He went as far as to liken the US selling Nvidia AI chips to China to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is ‘winning.&#39;”

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the real risks of advanced AI, a subject that remains heavily debated between realists, skeptics, and proponents of the tech. Critics have pointed out that the existential risks often cited by leaders like Amodei may be overblown, particularly as improvements in the tech appear to be slowing.

We should also consider the greater context of Amodei’s verbose warning. The CEO’s company is looking to close a massive, multibillion-dollar round of funding at a valuation of $350 billion. In other words, Amodei has an enormous financial interest in positioning himself as the solution to the risks he cites in his essay.

            <div id="article-text">Terminally online right wing dorks are falling head over heels for an AI-generated waifu — and setting themselves up to get scammed in the process.

The damsel at the center of all their fawning is “Amelia,” who, we must stress, is not real. Nonetheless, she’s everywhere on places like X, where users ask Elon Musk’s AI Grok to imagine her as a purple-haired British schoolgirl — because of course she is — who’s also the anti-woke rebel of their dreams.

Often proudly displaying a Union Jack, Amelia does things like burn pictures of British PM Keir Starmer and rail against Islam and immigrants. She’s also been shown reading the notoriously racist book “The Turner Diaries” and proudly appearing alongside a sieg heiling comrade, flagrantly betraying white supremacist and neo-Nazi sympathies.

But where did “Amelia” come from? According to reporting from The Guardian, she was initially a spoof of a goth-looking character in a video game called “Pathways.” Funded by the UK government, the game was designed to be a classroom tool for teaching teenagers how to avoid falling into online extremism, but quickly became the target of mockery by far-right figures on social media.

The trend was heavily pushed by an anonymous right-wing account on X starting on January 9, according to an analysis by Peryton Intelligence shared with The Guardian. Since then, “Ameliaposting” has surged from 500 posts per day to over 10,000.

Of course, where there’s right wing outrage involved, there’s a grift. An account roleplaying as Amelia began pushing a new Amelia-branded cryptocurrency called $AMELIAJAK, which was retweeted, and thereby effectively endorsed, by Musk, The Guardian noted. (Musk, it’s worth mentioning, has a documented fondness for AI-generated women, with even his own followers mocking him for openly “gooning to AI anime.”) The meme coin reeks of a scam called a rug pull, in which followers are baited into buying the coin to boost its value, before the founder sells all their assets at a higher price. This causes its value to crash, leaving the duped fans with worthless currency.

Not all meme coins end up as being overt scams, but clearly someone intends to profit off of Amelia’s “fame.” And in any case, the coins’ value often collapses on their own, since they’re propped up by nothing except a fleeting moment of internet virality. Amelia may be out there owning the libs and destroying woke, but she’s also emptying the wallets of many far-right memelords who see her as the imaginary, wildly racist goth girlfriend that they never had — but wish they did.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Braving poor visibility, high winds, and frigid temperatures, a team of researchers has finally established a foothold on Antarctica’s fastest melting glacier.

According to the New York Times — which embedded with the polar expedition — 10 drilling personnel and roughly 17 tons of gear have been safely deposited on top of the Thwaites Glacier on Monday. Their goal is to plant scientific instruments into the rapidly-melting berg over the next few days, in order to observe, and hopefully better understand, its faster-than-expected disintegration.

During a rare break in the weather, the NYT says helicopters airlifted the researchers and their equipment 19 miles to their planned outpost site on top of the glacier. The two helicopters involved flew a dozen total loads of cargo from the icebreaker ship to the camp site, while glacial scientists and engineers erected a small tent city, complete with bathrooms, generators, and a mess hall.

The stakes are high. At worst, experts fear that the destruction of the Thwaites — evocatively known among scientists as the “Doomsday Glacier” — could have catastrophic effects on sea levels and coast lines around the world.

The camp is rudimentary: the bathrooms are described as simple outhouses drilled into the snow, while the dining tent boasts a basic air fryer and bread machine. Most food consists of “low-effort meals,” the NYT explains, like freeze-dried fajita bowls and premade soup that can be warmed up. Still, the team also has a cooler full of frozen meat and veggies, which had to be buried within the snow.

Because the ship that carried the team to Thwaites needs to embark on another trek in just a few weeks, the drilling team will need to vacate the glacier by February 7. Before they do, they hope to deposit monitoring equipment into the ocean water half a mile below their feet.

If they’re successful, scientists will be able to remotely collect temperature data on the ocean waters thought to be contributing to the thinning ice shelf. That data is important for glaciologists, who’ve watched in horror as the Thwaites melted at a rate of two or three times faster than expected over recent years.

“We’re very lucky to be here; we also work very hard to be here,” Scott Polfrey, a mechanical engineer at the British Antarctic Survey told the NYT. “It’s important for everybody here that we do things safely and we come home with hopefully some hard-hitting scientific results that speak about our planet.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">No one is surprised that Neom — Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s $1.5 trillion-with-a-t plan to build a futuristic megacity smack dab in the middle of the desert — has turned out to be a disaster. Its centerpiece was supposed to be a towering skyscraper called The Line, over 100 miles in length, that could accommodate millions of people, something that the laws of reality always suggested would be impossible to pull off.

But, according to new reporting from the Financial Times, the saga may yet have a twist in store for us. The Saudi government is now considering drastically downsizing the linear city-skyscraper so it can instead turn Neom into a hub for — we swear we are not kidding — data centers.

It’s a proposal that reeks of a Saudi leadership desperate to find a way out of the multibillion dollar hole it’s dug for itself, as the dysfunctional monarchy rushes to follow what everyone else is doing and cash in on the AI race. But royal insiders briefed on the matter insist that, actually, it’s a testament to how flexible the Saudi government is.

“It shows that the system has a capacity to adjust its goals,” one of the people told the FT.

The pivot was proposed as Riyadh wraps up its year-long review of Neom’s progress, and continues a pattern of belt-tightening across the government’s myriad, exorbitantly expensive investments — which include everything from buying up entire sports leagues and teams to competitive video games. Ostensibly to diversify the country’s oil-dependent economy, they’re now becoming more burdensome as oil prices have been in steady decline, leaving the kingdom’s purportedly trillion dollar Public Investment Fund low on cash.

Jumping on the AI bandwagon, low hanging fruit as it is, could be lucrative for the Saudis. And according to the FT‘s source, Neom’s proximity to the Gulf of Aqaba makes it well suited for hosting data centers, even though seawater cooling is not the norm. “Data centers need water cooling and this is right on the coast so it will have seawater cooling,” the source said. “So it will be a major center for data centers.”

The extent that The Line will be downscaled remains unclear, but it apparently isn’t going away completely. The FT’s source said that architects were already working on redesigning the megastructure into a more “modest” — and radically changed — project.

“The Line will be a totally different concept. It will use the existing infrastructure in a totally different manner,” the person told the FT.

The linear city has been controversial since its conception due to its outrageous scale, exorbitant costs, and the human right abuses suffered by construction workers, with thousands believed to have died while working on the project. Now it could be facing its biggest reality check yet, though Neom has repeatedly denied previous reports suggesting it could be downsized.

As it stands, its fate hinges on the ongoing review, which is slated to finish by or near the end of the first quarter of this year.

            <div id="article-text">Organic food company Once Upon a Farm, known for its baby food and kids snacks, is resuming its IPO plans, per an SEC filing and Reuters. The company had initially planned to hold its IPO last year, though it paused it amid the government shutdown.

But it filed an updated S-1 on Tuesday which offered a price range of $17- $19 a share, indicating that the process has resumed, perhaps signalling that the overall IPO market is starting to thaw. The company is expected to make its debut on February 6, according to IPO Scoop.

Once Upon A Farm was founded in 2015 and counts actress Jennifer Garner among its co-founders (alongside serial founders Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz; Garner joined later). With Goldman Sachs and J.P Mogran as the lead bankers, the company is looking to raise at least $208.9 million at a $764.4 million valuation.

The company has raised almost $100 million in funding to date, according to PitchBook, with investors including S2G Ventures and CAVU Consumer Partners.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/ai-data-labeler-handshake-buys-cleanlab-an-acquisition-target-of-multiple-others/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI data labeling startup Handshake has acquired data label auditing startup Cleanlab, the companies tell TechCrunch.

Handshake began in 2013 as a platform for hiring college grads and launched a human data labeling business about a year ago to serve foundational AI model companies. Cleanlab, founded in 2021, is a startup that provides software for improving the quality of data produced by human labelers.

The deal’s purpose is primarily to acquire talent, aka an acqui-hire, adding nine key Cleanlab employees to Handshake’s research organization. This includes the startup’s co-founders, who earned their PhDs in computer science from MIT: Curtis Northcutt (pictured above), Jonas Mueller, and Anish Athalye. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed (though, as we previously reported, sometimes an acquihire can be surprisingly lucrative for founders.)

Cleanlab has raised a total of $30 million from investors including Menlo Ventures, TQ Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Databricks Ventures. At its peak, the startup had more than 30 employees.

Cleanlab’s researchers are experts in developing algorithms that flag incorrect data without a second human reviewer. The goal is to improve the quality of the data Handshake produces for AI labs.

“We have an in-house research team that thinks a lot about where our models are weak, what data should we be producing? How high quality is that data?” Sahil Bhaiwala, chief strategy and innovation officer at Handshake told TechCrunch. “The Cleanlab team has been focusing on this problem for years.”

Northcutt, the Cleanlab CEO who’s credited with pioneering its automating data labeling auditing, said the company received acquisition interest from other AI data labeling companies. But the startup chose to sell to Handshake because, he said, data labeling competitors including Mercor, Surge, and Scale AI frequently use Handshake’s platform to source human experts such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, for their data labeling projects.

“If you’re going to pick one, you should probably pick the source, not the middleman,” Northcutt told TechCrunch.

Handshake, which was last valued at $3.3 billion in 2022, was forecasted to end 2025 at $300 million in annualized revenue run rate (ARR), and is reportedly on track to reach an ARR of “high hundreds of millions” this year. The company has provided data for eight top AI labs, including OpenAI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, a swarm of AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company launched with the aim to replace Chrome with features like sidebar assistants and automated tasks. Now, Google is flexing its own AI muscles by adding similar features to Chrome, the world’s largest browser by market share.

While Google had introduced Gemini to Chrome last September, the assistant lived in a floating window. With this update, the company will put its AI helper into a persistent sidebar, so you can ask questions about the current website or other open tabs.

One interesting feature Google demoed to press ahead of today’s launch involved multiple tabs. When you open different tabs from a single webpage, the Gemini sidebar understands them as a context group. This is helpful when you are comparing prices or different products you’re considering purchasing.

Before today, the Gemini in Chrome feature was available only to Windows and MacOS users. With this rollout, the sidebar will be available to Chromebook Plus users as well.

Google is also taking advantage of its newly launched personal intelligence feature, which connects to your Gmail, Search, YouTube, and Google Photos accounts, allowing you to ask questions based on your own data. This feature will roll out in Chrome in the coming months, meaning that you can ask Gemini in the sidebar about things like your family’s schedule, or ask it to draft an email and send it without switching to Gmail.

There’s a new Nano Banana integration coming to Chrome, too, that allows you to modify an existing image with another image or product that you find while browsing.

However, the most ambitious feature is called auto-browse, which aims to handle tasks for you by using your personal information and traversing websites on your behalf. For instance, you can ask the agentic feature to go to a particular website and buy an item for you, and find a discount coupon. The agent will ask for your intervention when performing data-sensitive tasks, such as logging into a website or making a final purchase.

Last year, the company explained that these features would use Chrome’s password manager or saved card details, but said its AI models wouldn’t be exposed to any of these details.

This feature is rolling out initially to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S.

Browser-based agents are finicky and often fail to complete tasks. Google’s demo, just like tons of other AI demos, involved shopping and travel planning. In real-world use cases, agents often don’t get the intent or break during traversing different sites, and that would be a challenge for wider adoption.

The company said that in its early testing, users have used the feature for tasks such as scheduling appointments, filling out tedious online forms, collecting their tax documents, getting quotes for plumbers and electricians, and filing expense reports.

The company said that the Gemini sidebar support and Nano Banana integration are arriving starting today, while the personal intelligence feature will be available in the “coming months.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Creator platform Patreon is taking issue with Apple’s new mandate that forces all creators to move to a subscription billing model, which now has a new transition deadline of November 1, 2026.

While the coming changes will only impact the 4% of creators who are still using Patreon’s legacy billing models, the company’s announcement stressed that Apple’s lack of consistency around its changing terms has made it hard for creators to build healthy, long-term businesses.

What Patreon is referring to is the mandate Apple announced in 2024 around subscription billing changes. It said that Patreon must move all its creators to subscription billing using Apple’s in-app purchase system by November 2025 or else Patreon would risk removal from the App Store. Apple made this decision because Patreon was managing the billing for some percentage of creators’ subscriptions, and the tech giant saw that as skirting its App Store commission structure.

To Apple’s credit, Patreon was given plenty of time to migrate its customers to Apple’s in-app purchases.

The company said it would switch creators to subscription billing in November 2024, and creators could choose whether to increase their subscription prices to cover Apple’s fees. In addition, creators could opt to delay changes until November 2025 if they needed more time. However, they wouldn’t be able to offer subscriptions in the app until they adopted Apple’s in-app purchases.

Last May, Patreon took advantage of newly loosened App Store guidelines resulting from the U.S. court ruling in Epic v. Apple to offer creators the ability to process web payments from links in Patreon’s app. At the time, Patreon told creators that the earlier November 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. This gave creators even more time to decide what to do about their subscription businesses.

The company says now that its decision to pause the transition for its creators may have added to the confusion given that Apple is now reimposing a transition deadline of November 2026.

While Patreon is complying with Apple’s decision, it’s clearly bristling at the idea that the tech giant should have a say in how creators run their businesses.

“We strongly disagree with this decision,” its blog post states.

“Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal — the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months. Over the years, we have proposed multiple tools and features to Apple that we could’ve built to allow creators using legacy billing to transition on their own timelines, with more support added in. Unfortunately, Apple has continually declined them,” it says.

Creators can read more about the transition plan on Patreon’s website. It has also built several tools to support these changes, including a benefit eligibility tool to see who has paid or is scheduled to pay, tier repricing tools, and gifting and discount tools to offer payment flexibility. An option for annual-only memberships will be introduced before November 2026 as well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many in the industry think the winners of the AI model market have already been decided: Big Tech will own it (Google, Meta, Microsoft, a bit of Amazon) along with their model makers of choice, largely OpenAI and Anthropic.

But tiny 30-person startup Arcee AI disagrees. The company just released a truly and permanently open (Apache license) general-purpose, foundation model called Trinity, and Arcee claims that at 400B parameters, it is among the largest open source foundation models ever trained and released by a U.S. company.

Arcee says Trinity compares to Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick 400B, and Z.ai’s GLM-4.5, a high-performing open source model from China’s Tsinghua University, according to benchmark tests conducted using base models (very little post-training).

Like other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, Trinity is geared for coding and multi-step processes like agents. Still, despite its size, it’s not a true SOTA competitor yet because it currently supports only text.

More modes are in the works — a vision model is currently in development, and a speech-to-text version is on the roadmap, CTO Lucas Atkins told TechCrunch (pictured above, on the left). In comparison, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick is already multi-modal, supporting text and images.

But before adding more AI modes to its roster, Arcee says, it wanted a base LLM that would impress its main target customers: developers and academics. The team particularly wants to woo U.S. companies of all sizes away from choosing open models from China.

“Ultimately, the winners of this game, and the only way to really win over the usage, is to have the best open-weight model,” Atkins said. “To win the hearts and minds of developers, you have to give them the best.”

The benchmarks show that the Trinity base model, currently in preview while more post-training takes place, is largely holding its own and, in some cases, slightly besting Llama on tests of coding and math, common sense, knowledge, and reasoning.

The progress Arcee has made so far to become a competitive AI Lab is impressive. The large Trinity model follows two previous small models released in December: the 26B-parameter Trinity Mini, a fully post-trained reasoning model for tasks ranging from web apps to agents, and the 6B-parameter Trinity Nano, an experimental model designed to push the boundaries of models that are tiny yet chatty.

The kicker is, Arcee trained them all in six months for $20 million total, using 2,048 Nvidia Blackwell B300 GPUs. This out of the roughly $50 million the company has raised so far, said founder and CEO Mark McQuade (pictured above, on the right).

That kind of cash was “a lot for us,” said Atkins, who led the model building effort. Still, he acknowledged that it pales in comparison to how much bigger labs are spending right now.

The six-month timeline “was very calculated,” said Atkins, whose career before LLMs involved building voice agents for cars. “We are a younger startup that’s extremely hungry. We have a tremendous amount of talent and bright young researchers who, when given the opportunity to spend this amount of money and train a model of this size, we trusted that they’d rise to the occasion. And they certainly did, with many sleepless nights, many long hours.”

McQuade, previously an early employee at open-source model marketplace HuggingFace, says Arcee didn’t start out wanting to become a new U.S. AI Lab: The company was originally doing model customization for large enterprise clients like SK Telecom.

“We were only doing post-training. So we would take the great work of others: We would take a Llama model, we would take a Mistral model, we would take a Qwen model that was open source, and we would post-train it to make it better” for a company’s intended use, he said, including doing the reinforcement learning.

But as their client list grew, Atkins said, the need for their own model was becoming a necessity, and McQuade was worried about relying on other companies. At the same time, many of the best open models were coming from China, which U.S. enterprises were leery of, or were barred from using.

It was a nerve-wracking decision. “I think there’s less than 20 companies in the world that have ever pre-trained and released their own model” at the size and level that Arcee was gunning for, McQuade said.

The company started small at first, trying its hand at a tiny, 4.5B model created in partnership with training company DatologyAI. The project’s success then encouraged bigger endeavors.

But if the U.S. already has Llama, why does it need another open weight model? Atkins says by choosing the open source Apache license, the startup is committed to always keeping its models open. This comes after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year indicated his company might not always make all of its most advanced models open source.

“Llama can be looked at as not truly open source as it uses a Meta-controlled license with commercial and usage caveats,” he says. This has caused some open source organizations to claim that Llama isn’t open source compliant at all.

“Arcee exists because the U.S. needs a permanently open, Apache-licensed, frontier-grade alternative that can actually compete at today’s frontier,” McQuade said.

All Trinity models, large and small, can be downloaded for free. The largest version will be released in three flavors. Trinity Large Preview is a lightly post-trained instruct model, meaning it’s been trained to follow human instructions, not just predict the next word, which gears it for general chat usage. Trinity Large Base is the base model without post-training.

Then we have TrueBase, a model with any instruct data or post training so enterprises or researchers that want to customize it won’t have to unroll any data, rules or assumptions.

Acree AI will eventually offer a hosted version of its general release model for, it says, competitive API pricing. That release is up to six weeks away as the startup continues to improve the model’s reasoning training.

API pricing for Trinity-Mini is $0.045 / $0.15, and there is a rate-limited free tier available, too. Meanwhile, the company still sells post-training and customization options.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk is eyeing sometime in June for SpaceX’s blockbuster IPO, according to the Financial Times. The billionaire reportedly wants the offering to coincide with both his birthday (June 28th) and the rare alignment of Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter (which is happening in early June).

Regardless of when it happens, though, SpaceX’s IPO will likely be one of the largest in history: It’s looking to raise at least $50 billion at a $1.5 trillion valuation, per the FT (which also noted that those figures are likely to change).

The company wants more funding as it builds its Starship rocket, aiming to reach Mars. SpaceX is one of the nation’s most valuable private companies, and it last held a secondary sale in December that would give it an $800 billion valuation.

            <h2>America’s Convenience-Store Conundrum</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/americas-convenience-store-conundrum/685790/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a new rallying cry: Eat real food. It’s an intuitive piece of advice—snack on some grapes instead of potato chips, trade that microwaveable mystery meat for a grilled chicken breast. The tagline has accompanied the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the government’s official nutrition recommendations, which call for Americans to prioritize whole foods and limit processed ones. “It’s time to start eating real food again,” the health secretary said during a speech in Pennsylvania last week. The Trump administration has even launched a new website, realfood.gov, which welcomes visitors with an animation of a steak, a carton of whole milk, and a head of broccoli.

The path toward Kennedy’s goal runs through an overlooked piece of the food landscape: convenience stores. The purveyors of late-night hot dogs, tins of Zyn, and countless varieties of gummy worms generally don’t sell a lot of “real food.” But in America’s food deserts, convenience stores are more than just places to pick up a snack—they’re grocery stores. The USDA estimates that tens of millions of Americans live in low-income areas with limited access to grocery stores. Mini-marts such as 7-Eleven and Sheetz “have an outsized role in our food system because they are the only food access point in many neighborhoods,” Hilary Seligman, an expert on food insecurity at UC San Francisco, told me.

The Trump administration does have a tool it can use to force the humble mini-mart to stock healthier options. Food stamps are an essential part of convenience stores’ business, but to participate in the program, retailers must carry products across a range of food groups. Those standards are poised to get an overhaul: “We are requiring that every outlet that accepts food stamps double the amount of real food that it sells in its facility,” Kennedy said last week. That decision is really up to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, whose agency runs the food-stamp program, and she made similar comments at a press conference earlier this month. When I asked the Department of Agriculture for more details about the planned changes, a spokesperson directed me to a proposal released in draft form last fall. Under those new rules, stores would be required to carry seven varieties of food across four categories: protein, dairy, grains, and vegetables and fruits.

The move could put us one step closer to healthy convenience stores, which have long been a dream of some nutrition reformers. Several experiments in different cities—including in Baltimore, New Orleans, and Denver—have tried to alleviate the problem of food deserts by improving the offerings at local mini-marts. A review of these pilot programs found “consistent improvements across most of the trials in the availability and sale of healthy foods, the purchase and consumption of those foods, and consumer knowledge.”

But the Trump administration’s plan isn’t perfect. Under the draft proposal, corner stores won’t have to follow any specific nutritional guidelines, so long as they meet the food-group standards. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, has warned that the new standards mean that stores could stock Fruity Pebbles to fulfill the grain requirement, and sugary canned peaches for the fruit requirement. “It would be very easy for a retailer to meet the proposed rule by stocking foods in each staple food category that are high in added sugar, sodium, saturated fat, and refined grains,” Joelle Johnson, the deputy director of CSPI, told me.

Read: Why don’t convenience stores sell better food?

Changing mini-marts for good won’t be easy. Owners stock their stores based on what sells, and available data suggest that “real food” isn’t exactly driving sales. A recent analysis by Lula Commerce, an online-shopping tool for convenience stores, found that alcohol, soda, and energy drinks were the top items ordered by their stores’ customers. And a 2021 report by the National Association of Convenience Stores pointed to packaged beverages, cigarettes, and salty snacks as among the best sellers. Convenience stores are concerned that stocking healthy products will just mean wasted shelf space in their already crowded stores. They typically don’t have the margins necessary to swap out a section of the drink cooler to stock cauliflower or salmon filets, especially when these products may rot. NACS supports aspects of the Trump administration’s push to heighten the requirements for what these stores have to stock, Margaret Hardin Mannion, the group’s director of government relations, told me. But, she added, “we have to be able to sell what our customers want to buy.” Though the Trump administration is within its power to mandate that convenience stores participating in the food-stamps program stock as many healthy goods as it deems fit, that could easily backfire if retailers back out of the program entirely.

Until convenience stores actually give customers the option to buy strawberries instead of Slim Jims, it’s hard to know exactly how well-founded their fears really are. The smattering of experiments that stocked mini-marts with fresh produce suggest that people do have some interest in eating healthier when they can. But many of these trials also included efforts meant specifically to drum up sales of healthy items. In one experiment in Baltimore, convenience stores were encouraged to stock certain healthy foods through subsidies from researchers. Retailers hung up posters to promote these new healthy foods, and some gave out coupons to encourage specific purchases. Replicating an experiment like this on the national scale would cost some major cash. (There are more than 150,000 convenience stores in the United States.) And it would require a real leap of faith from an administration that to date has focused much of its efforts on restricting the products that can be purchased with food stamps, and on rooting out alleged fraud within the program.

For now, RFK Jr. and other health officials are stuck with a convenience-store conundrum. The mini-mart embodies how hard it is to actually improve the American diet. It’s enough of a challenge to get stores to stock their shelves with broccoli. But that still isn’t a guarantee that people will put down the Doritos.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, David opens with his reflections on the recent shootings in Minneapolis. He argues that these killings, alongside ICE’s warrantless home raids and mistaken detentions, and the reports of deaths in custody, are not isolated abuses but signs of a rapidly deepening crisis in American democracy, one in which basic rights and due process are applied unevenly and increasingly contested. David asks whether the country can find a way back from a dangerous moral and political impasse, as a majority of Americans recoil from these actions while a determined minority continue to defend them.

Then, David is joined by the New York Times columnist and Atlantic contributor David Brooks. Frum and Brooks discuss the origins of the term neocon, what the neocons got right, and why they should be listened to today. Brooks describes how America’s problems long predate Trump, and why elections alone cannot fix what has been lost. Together, Frum and Brooks explore whether the country is capable of moral renewal, what rebuilding would actually require, and why recovery, if it comes at all, will be slow, difficult, and deeply personal.

Finally, David ends the episode with his thoughts on Death by Lightning, a television series on Netflix based on the assassination of President James Garfield, and how, when watching historical dramas, we need to look back on the past with a contextual lens, one that we should bring to our present too.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. If you have listened to or watched this program before, you will notice that this present opening looks and sounds a little different from usual. Let me hasten to assure you that most of the show will look as normal. There will be a dialogue between me and David Brooks, columnist at The New York Times and contributor to The Atlantic; that will look and sound normal. And we will conclude with a discussion of the new four-part Netflix miniseries Death by Lightning, a dramatization based on the assassination of President [James] Garfield; that will look and sound like normal. But this opening will not, and does not, look and sound like normal, and I have to beg your pardon for that.

Here’s my excuse. I planned a family vacation in South America for the final two weeks in January. I prerecorded the dialogue and the book talk and also the opening monologue because I thought, What crazy things can possibly happen in the last two weeks of January? Well, you know as well as I what crazy things have happened in the last two weeks of January: NATO allies like France and Britain, Denmark and Norway moving troops into Greenland. An altercation at Davos between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Canada that concluded, or has yielded. Members of the Trump Cabinet now promoting the secession of the Canadian province of Alberta to retaliate and threatening Canada with all kinds of massive tariffs to punish Canada for its prime minister getting too much attention at Davos. President [Donald] Trump making it clear that everything he’s been doing in foreign policy is motivated by his thwarted desire for a Nobel Peace Prize. And of course, and above all, the terrible events in the city of Minneapolis, where a second American citizen has been killed by agents purportedly enforcing the law while that American citizen was, according to most, if not all, video evidence presenting no danger to anybody, least of all officers of the law. And the terrible, systematic lying that has surrounded each of these terrible incidents, with their attacks on basic norms of American rights and process.

It’s not just the American citizens who have been killed that are a scandal that shocks the nation coming from Minneapolis; forces of the law have burst into private homes without a warrant, have seized people—the wrong people—hauled them out into the streets in their underwear in a Minnesota January. We are hearing reports of deaths in detention, people being reportedly killed in detention. This is all on top of the previous cases of people being sent by American immigration authorities to torture centers in third countries, centers that have been closed down by American courts because they violate basic norms of due process, and American civil rights and civil liberties. It’s a shocking, shocking story.

And even as I record, in the final week of January, it is amazing how much of this story remains murky and mysterious. An American citizen has been killed. We don’t know the names of his killer. We don’t know whether the killer has been removed from the streets of Minneapolis. The representatives of the state of Minnesota have been debarred from investigating what happened, how this terrible event could have unfolded in the way that it did. A man has been shot in the back when he was disarmed, while he was being beaten—in a beating we all saw on camera—for the apparent offense of recording the activities of law enforcement and personnel, which was his total personal right to do, while carrying a gun, which was his right to do. I’m someone who’s pretty skeptical of the way American gun rights have unfolded, but skepticism does not mean that, if you carry a gun according to the law of your state, that that gives the agents of the state power or right to seize you, force you to the ground, remove the gun from you, beat you, and then shoot you in the back, reportedly 10 times. Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong, and it’s getting wronger.

Now, the good news is that a substantial majority of American citizens object to this wrong and oppose it, and that majority seems to be growing. The bad news is, is that an important minority continue to defend these actions, and are rallying to the support of the personnel who commit these acts and the larger structures of permission that authorize and enabled and defend these acts.

This a country that is now split on the basic question, “Can an American citizen be gunned down on the streets of his own city while carrying in his hands nothing more dangerous than a cellphone?” Opinion is split.

David Brooks and I, in our dialogue, will talk a little bit about how, someday, the MAGA forces, the people who supported MAGA, may be reintegrated into the American family, into American democracy. David Brooks advocates a very open-armed and forgiving approach; I’m not so sure that he’s right about that. But that is something that we’ll discuss, and you will form your own opinion after hearing our discussion.

For now, we have the problem that the people who are carrying out these acts, against the wishes of the great majority of Americans, with the support of a minority of Americans, they remain in power. Now, I think we all know MAGA people and we all know that, most people who supported Donald Trump, or many of the people who supported Donald Trump, did not begin as bad people, but they are justifying bad things—and things that are getting worse and worse and worse at an accelerating rate. It is sobering to consider, if this is what has happened in year one of the Trump administration, as Trump and his people come closer to whatever kind of reckoning is available in November of 2026, what will the year ahead look like? What does 2026 hold? It looks like it will hold more abuses, more offenses, more attacks, more contempt for basic American values and law. And we all have to find our way to come up with some kind of effective collective response.

We appear to be heading to a government shutdown, as Democrats in the Senate say they will not vote to fund ICE if it continues the kind of operations it’s been doing. This may be quite a long government shutdown because there’s going to be a lot at stake for everybody involved.

But we are facing a kind of crisis in American democracy that is worse than anything that even people who were really worried about it, as I was, predicted a year ago, never mind at the very beginning of the Trump experiment in 2016, 2017, 2015, when Trump declared for office. We’ve been kind of walking a path to moral degradation, and we’re trying to stay away from the finale of moral ruin.

I don’t know what’s ahead. I’m terribly worried. I hope we find a way out together, that there can become some kind of collective American agreement on what it means to hold the rights that American citizens should hold, on what it means that American citizens are being gunned down in the streets of their cities—on the sidewalk, in their cars. That American citizens, naturalized citizens, but American as anybody else, are being hauled from their houses without a warrant, and that important people in American government insist that there no warrant is due because the provisions of 1776, which listed abuses of the search power as one of the causes of separation of the United States from Great Britain, that those principles no longer apply, at least they don’t apply to Americans of certain kinds of last names, and certain kind of accents, and certain kinds of backgrounds and personal stories, and certain kind of skin colors—that other Americans have got them. that MAGA people carry guns at their events and, of course, don’t expect to be executed for it, but other Americans don’t have those rights; MAGA people expect to be served with warrants in their homes if someone needs to search their homes for something, but other people don’t have those rights. They don’t extend to others the rights they claim for themselves.

How will we find a way from this impasse? Well, David and I will talk about it, and I hope you will stick around to watch a more normal-looking version of this program.

Frum: David Brooks is a contributing editor at The Atlantic. Oh, he’s also one of the most popular writers and speakers in the entire English-speaking world, with a career that spans many decades at every distinguished institution. I was a colleague of his at The Weekly Standard in the 1990s. But you probably know him from his role at The New York Times as one of the most influential newspaper columnists in America for more than two decades, from his appearances on PBS and NPR, or you may have seen one of his innumerable appearances on public platforms, where he delights audiences in every state of this country and every country of the world, it seems. He is an indefatigable writer. He is the author of more books than I can even tally, all of which have gone on to enormous success. Most recently is the 2023 book How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen. And I’m just so grateful he has taken time away from his whirligig of activities to join me today on The David Frum Show.

David Brooks: I think we were actually colleagues at The Wall Street Journal first, before The Weekly Standard, back in the ’80s—

Frum: —that’s true. That’s true. And you went off to glory at The Wall Street Journal Europe, where you covered the ’89 uprisings, terrifying your grandmother. You had a wonderful line—I remember this—that she called you in Brussels and said, But, David, what if the revolution spreads?

Brooks: (Laughs.) True, and sure enough, it did.

Frum: (Laughs.) I wanna talk to you about your recent article for The Atlantic that appeared online in December and then in the print edition in January, called “The Neocons Were Right.” I think a lot of people are used to hearing this term used as a kind of shorthand in politics or conspiracy theory, but maybe some of us don’t know exactly what the term means. So could you explain what a neoconservative is, or was, and why it mattered once upon a time and now?

Brooks: Yeah. When people hear these days neocon, they think of the Iraq War, and they think of Republicans who supported the Iraq War. But neoconservatism, actually, it has its roots in a dining hall, a college dining hall.

The City College of New York was a school, or still is a school mostly for immigrant kids—in those days, I think no tuition; now very low tuition. So if you’ve just come to America and you wanna make it, City College is a great place to go. And in the 1930s, there were a group of young, mostly Jewish kids who were communists. And they had names like Nathan Glazer and Seymour Martin Lipset and Irving Kristol. And they were a certain kind of communist; they were Trotskyites. And the Trotskyites were the smart communists, basically. (Laughs.) And there were another kind called the Stalinists, and they were sort of the dumb conformists, to be honest. And in the dining hall, the Trotskyites, like Kristol and Nathan Glazer, ate in Alcove 1, a little part of the dining hall, and the Stalinists ate in Alcove 2. And the Trotskyites were so much better at beating the Stalinists in argument, the Stalinists, in true Stalinist fashion, forbade their members from debating with the Trotskyites.

And so they were communists in the ’30s. And then along comes the war; a bunch of the neocons, like Irving Kristol, served in World War II. And they realized communism was not gonna work. And so they became disillusioned with that. And then they became pretty standard Franklin Roosevelt Democrats. And some, like Nathan Glazer, went to work for John F. Kennedy. And in the early ’60s, there was great faith in social science. Politics didn’t have to be this big, messy ideological thing; we could just sic a lot of economists at a problem, and they would devise a rational, technocratic solution. And Irving Kristol and another, vaguely, person called neoconservative, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, formed a magazine called The Public Interest, and in the very first issue, Moynihan said, We’ve learned how to make a society work. And they were just standard-issue Democrats.

And then along comes 1968, ’69, a lot of the policies that they had so earnestly championed in the early ’60s were not working. American cities went into decay, rising crime rates, rising divorce rates, more kids born out of wedlock. There was just a lot of social anarchy. I was a kid in New York City in the 1970s, and everybody got mugged. The crime rates were incredible. There was a serial castrator on the Upper West Side who would take kids, lead ’m into Central Park, castrate them, and then murder them. And his nickname was Charlie Chop-Off. (Laughs.) And the crime was so bad in those days, Charlie Chop-Off was not even a big story. (Laughs.) But so there was so much social decay, and so the neocons, the people we now call neocons, said, Whoa, all the social planning that we had such faith in 10 years ago, we were wrong. Like, Well, the world’s a lot more complicated than we thought. And as Irving Kristol famously put it, a neoconservative is “a liberal who’s been mugged by reality.”

And the second thing that happened in the 1960s was a group of—these immigrant kids believed in the bourgeois values: Work hard. Dress neatly. Respect your parents. Along came these rich hippies, saying, Don’t work hard. Drop out. Do drugs. And they were outraged; they were just morally offended.

And so that’s really the roots of neoconservatism. It’s not some right-wing Republican thing; it started as a strategy of dissent within the Democratic Party.

Frum: Okay, but the distance in time from the 1960s to us is the same as the distance in time from when these people were young, in the 1930s, to Reconstruction.

Frum: (Laughs.) Did I just do that math right? Yeah, it’s, like, 60 years. So why would you write a magazine article in 2026 saying these people who were active from 1930-something to 1960-something were right about anything to do with us? How does this bear on our lives today in any way?

Brooks: Because I’m a human anachronism. That’s why.

Frum: (Laughs.) No, no, you have your finger on the pulse. We count on your observations to tell us what’s going on in America, so what’s going on in America that any of this helps us with?

Brooks: I think what the neoconservatives can do is they teach us, first of all, some of the things they learned in the ’60s: Life is really complicated. You should do social policy. You should try to improve government, but you should realize that most policies fail, and you should really have good reasons, and you should make it bureaucratic. But I think the core insight for the neocons—they not only grew up as policy people; they were influenced by literature, by culture, by theology, by Talmudic study. And so they made no distinction between what you would call theological, philosophical, cultural growth—moral formation—and policy. And so they brought a much more humanistic lens to see policy; it’s not just about economics and growth. [The] elemental question is (a) can we build a civilization we can be proud of, and (b) can we create policies that will nurture values, the right kind of values?

In 1985, one of the great neoconservative political scientists, a guy named James Q. Wilson, who spent much of his career at Harvard, said, All we’re trying to do is trying to inculcate certain virtues, whether we’re talking about education, when we’re talking about trying to reduce recidivism, when we’re trying to talk about conducting our fiscal policy. And we can either have good values, and for the neoconservatives, the good values were the bourgeois values—being decent to people, being neighborly, showing up on time, working hard—not lofty Kantian values, or we can have bad values. And if we run deficits, we’re basically behaving selfishly to future generations. If we subsidize nonwork, then we will discourage people from becoming industrious and that kind of person. And so I think one of the things they do—and especially in a moment right now, when we’re in a myriad of really moral [crises] in our politics, where basically 78 million Americans take a look at Donald Trump and they see nothing morally wrong.

Frum: Okay, so we are at a moment—I was wondering where you were going to go—we’re at a moment when agencies of government, Cabinet-level departments, are, for their own amusement, tweeting out variations that are obviously intended to be variations on Nazi Party slogans: “One people, one empire, one leader”; when we have masked armed men roaming American cities, detaining people without any right to detain them, beating up people, in some cases killing them. We have the most corrupt administration—not in American history, but I keep saying, if this were a Nigerian administration, it would be one of the most corrupt administrations in Nigerian history—to your point about bourgeois values, where the president of the United States was a close friend to, and seems to be operating a cover-up on behalf of, one of the most notorious child-molestation rings (Laughs.) in American history. And how is Irving Kristol going to help us with any of this?

Brooks: (Laughs.) Well, (a) ’cause he reminds us—and especially his wife, Gertrude Himmelfarb, the historian—he reminds us the power of the spirit of an age, that we live within a moral ecology tnd that moral ecology is not only constructed by each of us in our own behaviors, but it’s constructed by the arts, by literature, and by the example set by great political leaders.

This is Gertrude Himmelfarb, the great historian of Victorian England—in 1810, it was completely normal for a guy to get drunk after work, go home, and beat his wife. There was no harsh judgment about that; that’s just the way things are. And along came a group called the Clapham Sect, who were basically evangelicals, and they said, No, that is not gonna be acceptable behavior anymore. So they reset the norms of what acceptable behavior was going to be. They’re sort of the beginnings of Victorian morality. And as part of that, they said, We have such respect for human dignity, we’re gonna campaign against the slave trade. And so what Himmelfarb describes is a period of moral improvement for a whole society. We all live on the cultural capital of centuries gone by, and if we tear away at that capital, then we’re lost in the world Stephen Miller talked about last week, which is a war of all against all, where force is the only thing that matters; a shared morality does not matter.

And so I think they give us the tools to think about, How do we reconstruct a social order so we can trust one another once again and so we can treat each other decently once again?

Frum: Many of the people that you and I knew when we were young have gone on to power and prominence, and they started off sharing many of the ideas, or at least participating in many of the ideas that you’re describing. And today, we have a world in which the bright lights of the younger intellectual right are inspired at best, at best, by the idea of abolishing the difference between church and state and letting the church run everything, and at worst by outright fascism, and at very worst by flirtations with literal Nazism. So, that’s what’s happened to the conservative world in which we’ve moved. And the result is that people of conservative instinct, which I still consider myself to be and I think you may as well, find ourselves mute and voiceless when we hear things from people on the more liberal, or left, side of the spectrum, saying, Well, they have some things we don’t like, but what do we have to set against this when the choices really do seem to be wokeism or fascism? (Laughs.) How is Irving Kristol going to help us with our dilemma? If I have to choose, I’m choosing wokeism over fascism, but I’m not crazy about either.

Brooks: Yeah, you’re really cheering me up. So glad I came on the podcast. No, I’m kidding. (Laughs.) You and I—

Frum: (Laughs.) No concessions—speaking of, like, the neoconservative spirit—no concessions to the need for uplift here. We’re going for the full gloom-and-doom situation.

Brooks: (Laughs.) So you and I got out of school at about the same time and entered our business at the same time. And at that time, I was working at National Review in the mid-’80s, and another group of people came out of school at the same time. And I came out of the University of Chicago; you came out of a fancier school back east. But there were a group of students from Dartmouth—

Frum: I think you meant easier school, but you’re being polite.

Brooks: So there were a group from Dartmouth who worked at a magazine called The Dartmouth Review, and people will know some of them still: Laura Ingraham, Dinesh D’Souza. There was a guy named Ben Hart. There was a guy named Greg Fossedal. And I did not appreciate the distinction; I thought we were all on the same team. But there was a distinction—I think earnest people like me and you, we were pro-conservative. We had read Edmund Burke and Isaiah Berlin and Adam Smith, and we had these earnest ideas that was pro-a conservative vision of society. But Dinesh D’Souza and Laura Ingraham, they were not pro-conservative; they were anti-left.

And there was an episode that illustrates for me how they were different from us: that during the ’80s, to protest apartheid, students on a lot of campuses put up shantytowns, and it was to represent the suffering of Black citizens of South Africa under apartheid. And one night, a bunch of the editors of The Dartmouth Review descended on the shantytown protests and, with sledgehammers, slammed them down. And I remember being appalled, (a) because apartheid really was evil and was worth opposing, but (b) going through a protest with sledgehammers and destroying it, that’s not America; that’s [Joseph] Goebbels. That is really thuggish fascism. And I thought they were low-rent; I thought those people were intellectually mediocre. But it turns out there were a lot more people who were anti-left than there were pro-conservative, especially as the time went [by].

And so what you have in the Trump administration is people with the same profile as the Dartmouth Review crowd: They went to elite schools, but they hated what they found there. That’s Steven Miller, who went to Duke. That’s Pete Hegseth, who went to Princeton. That’s J. D. Vance, who went to Yale Law. Now, you can go down the list. It’s Elon Musk and Donald Trump went to Penn. And so these are not pro-conservative. These are oppositional nihilists who hate the liberal establishment. And I found it easy, when I was saying college, to be more conservative than my professors but still have reverence for their learning. But these people do not have reverence for learning; they just want to offend the bourgeoisie. And so that’s what it’s become. And then they’ve produced spawn of young people who just think, That’s cool. That’s edgy. And of course, you have to up the dosage when you’re giving people edgy nihilism—it just has to get worse and worse and worse. And as Richard Weaver, a philosopher from the 1950s, said, The problem with the younger generation is they haven’t read the minutes to the last meeting. And so you get a group of people who, when they see fascistic behavior, don’t understand where that eventually leads.

Frum: When you set out the stage for us, you described events or thinkers or currents that were active between the 1930s and the 1960s. How does any of this get attached to the Iraq War all those years later?

Brooks: Well, I think it got attached—and I’ll tell my story—I think what happened was, neoconservatives, as I said, really believe in the nature of a regime. They want America to stand for certain values, and they’re appalled by regimes that stand for evil values. And the Soviet Union was like that, and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was like that. And so they said, If you have a regime that is internally and domestically poisonous and oppressive, it will be dangerous to the world. And I would say, in my life in the ’90s, I was covering the end of apartheid, the end of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, the Oslo peace process in the Middle East. I was watching democracy be created, and it seemed to me we were on a tidal wave of creating societies with better democratic values. And so I think a lot of neocons like me or others and our elders supported the Iraq War for that reason: because they thought fighting for a democratic wave was the right thing to do.

What they did not sufficiently appreciate, what we, and especially me, did not sufficiently—the other thing I had said earlier about neocons: epistemological modesty. Be careful about trying to change complex circumstances, ’cause you’re gonna screw it up. And we ignored one of the core tenets of our own belief system; we were so swept up in the moment. And if we’d only gone back to the single most famous neoconservative foreign-policy essay of all time, was written by Jeane Kirkpatrick, and her argument was that if you’re gonna try to a democracy in an authoritarian context, you need generations of civic planning, of civic organization, of moral foundations of a democracy. You can’t just imagine you can do it overnight. And we forgot that lesson.

Frum: Mm. Well, we are, in many ways, living in the 2020s in the Iraq hangover, that many people—people of good faith, people of bad faith—took the lesson from the Iraq experience to stay out of everything. And so we’ve had a decade and a half where America has largely been absent from many of the great decisions of the time. And in the Obama administration, [President Barack] Obama backed away from the Syrian civil war, a war that looks more and more important the farther we get from it. He laid down some red lines, and he said he would enforce them, and he had, certainly, I think, abundant authority on his own to do it, but the moment Congress raised any objection, he backed away and then said, Okay, well, it’s because of Congress. My hands are tied. I’m powerless to intervene. And so you got this extraordinary wave of refugees from Syria—I forget the number of how many millions of people. Half the population of Syria was internally displaced; millions left. Millions of other people from other places moved at the same time and destabilized the politics of Europe and the whole world.

The United States was quite passive when the Russians invaded Crimea in 2014, and the Trump years are their own story. And now we see people in the streets of Iranian cities chanting, looking for American help, and we are in a country where people no longer feel that there is a right, a calling, or any likelihood of success in America intervening in these important conflicts. And the world is on its own now, without American guidance, at the mercy of whoever looks like the second-strongest candidate to guide the world.

Brooks: Yeah, when we withdrew, our friend Robert Kagan wrote a book called The Jungle Grows Back, which is to say, when there’s no social order holding the world, then the wolves take over. And wolves like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] and others have taken over. And people [in] this country on the populist right and sometimes on the left think, Oh, that old neoliberal order, that was all a scam. It was a scam for America to exercise imperial hegemony, but it was all just words. But that liberal world order that people built after World War II, and that people like Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman enforced, that really did restrain people. And so the world has just become a more dangerous place. And America has taken one of our great assets, which is our ideals—I’ve covered so many people around the world, and they want democracy; they want dignity—and we have squandered that strength. It’s an actual source of strength. And then the final thing, we replaced it now with Donald Trump. We’re no longer hanging back. Suddenly, we’re launching forever wars all the hell all over the place, but we’re not doing it on behalf of ideals; we’re doing it on behalf of nihilism, on behalf of oil. I feel sorry for all my left-wing friends, who used to—and when they talked about George W. Bush, they would say, He claims to be for democracy, but really, this war is all about oil. And they had the subtle ways to see what the real meaning of what Bush was saying was. But that skill’s no longer necessary because Donald Trump says, Yeah, it’s all about oil. What are you gonna do about it?

And so I would ask people, “If you thought American foreign-policy idealism was discredited by Iraq, which it largely was, how do you like the anti-idealistic foreign policy, a policy of pure material greed?”

Frum: Let’s go back to these old books and essays, and think about, What are the lessons that, in the age of Trumpism, we need, whether we are broadly sympathetic to conservative projects or if we’re broadly unsympathetic. Let’s start with the other side. If you’re someone who’s not a conservative and you think of yourself as a liberal or even a progressive, is there any value in any of these old ideas in the face of an administration, as I said, where at best we’re looking at people who wanna overthrow the separation of church and state, with the church in charge, and at worst functional fascists and on the edge outright Nazi sympathizers and apologists? Why isn’t the lesson for a person of liberal views or progressive views to say, You know what? Conservatism was always a terrible idea. I never liked any of these folks. They’re now even worse than before. I have nothing to learn from any of them?

Brooks: Well, a lot of my more progressive friends are always nostalgic for the last conservatives. And so I started saying, Well, wait ’til we have a Republican government that makes you nostalgic for Donald Trump. (Laughs.) So that seems to be the trend.

I would say there are certain things that are not liberal or conservative. They used to be consensus American positions. One is that we have a social order, that there are certain rules and certain beliefs and values that we share, that form the basis of how we live. George Marsden is a great historian, and he wrote this about Martin Luther King [Jr.]’s rhetoric: He says, What gave King’s rhetoric such force is the idea that right and wrong are written into the fabric of the universe. That slavery is not just wrong in some times and some places; it’s always wrong. Segregation is not just wrong in some times and some places; it is always wrong. Right and wrong are written into the fabric of the universe. And when you have that social order, people feel held. You can have a society ’cause we have a shared understanding of what’s right and wrong. We have a shared sense of norms about what’s right and wrong, so we’re gonna behave [with] each other; we can trust each other. Two generations ago, 60 percent of Americans said, Yeah, my neighbors are trustworthy. That’s not a liberal or a conservative thing; that was a great human achievement. And what happened? We shredded the shared moral order. And that was not just a conservative project; it was a liberal project too.

And so one of the things we did is we privatized morality. We said to people, Come up with your own values. And the problem with that is that there’s no shared morality if everyone has to come up with their own values. And the other problem with that is, unless your name is Aristotle, you can’t come up with values. Walter Lippmann, a great columnist in the 1950s, wrote a book in which he said, If what is right and wrong is based on what each individual feels according to their emotions, then we are outside the bounds of civilization. And so this moral collapse, I think, is what undergirds the rise of Trump. It undergirds the alienation. It undergirds the idea that we want a politics that’s based not on ideals and values, that it’s about power and it’s about who has more force. And so if we’re gonna get over Trumpism or the [Alternative for Democracy] AfFD or [French politician Marine] Le Pen, we need a set of ideals that can hold society together and create some social trust, and we need ideals that have some roots—and this is what the New York conservatives were good about—in universal values. It’s not just my kind. All through much of human history, my kind of people are the kind of people I care about, and I don’t care about the other kind. But it was a great achievement of civilization to say, No, I care about all people, maybe not all equally, but there are certain ideas that apply to everybody, ideas of dignity, democracy, and kindness. And that was an achievement.

And so I think the neoconservatives were inheritors, maybe more conservative than not, some not, but they were the inheritors of that idea, and they caused us to see politics and see our national culture through the lens of either a shared moral order or a lack of one.

Frum: I am, like you, formed in many ways by this tradition. I’ve got some critical distance from it. I never really felt like I was a part—I read the books; I never felt like I was part of the social circle that was such an important aspect of the neoconservative world when it was a real thing. So I knew these things through print rather than through personality. And in a way, that was kind of disqualifying because neoconservatism was as much a milieu as it was a set of ideas, and I was not a member of that milieu. Maybe I’m just anti-social. But the question I think about a lot as we are trying to move beyond Trumpism is it does seem like there’s about to be a big swing of political power in the United States in ’26 and ’28. I worried through the year 2025 that Trump would somehow be able to distort the election enough to hold on to power, the coming congressional election. I think the tide against him is now too big for those methods to work. Unless he tries an outright coup d&#39;état, I don’t know how he stops it.

So there’s likely to be a shift in power. And the question I find myself thinking about a lot—and I have no answer to this, and I’d be very interested to be guided by the wisdom you draw from these texts and your own wisdom. When President [Joe] Biden entered office in 2021, clearly, his thought, or clearly to me, his thought was, We need to get past the recent unpleasantness. We need a policy of accommodation. We need a policy of looking forward, not backward. And while, when people have actually sacked the Capitol, they have to be held to account, we’re not gonna object too much if their higher-ups—a justice system goes real, real slow on bringing justice to the people who gave the orders for the sacking on January 6, 2021. We’ll punish the actual foot soldiers, but we’ll leave the colonels and generals alone mostly, to the extent we can. The question I am struggling with is: If and when power does shift, was the Biden attitude the right one, to be reapplied in ’27 and ’29, or do we need some kind of lustration, something like what the Czechs and Hungarians and Poles did after 1989? They said, Look, we have an elite that was authoritarian, corrupt, and criminal, in some cases homicidal. And we can’t do justice in every case, but we need to find some system to hold the previous administration to a moral and legal account, and exclude them from power. I can’t make up my mind what’s the right answer. What guidance would you draw from these old texts?

Brooks: Yeah, I guess I would not be for mass defenestrations.

Frum: I’m not throwing them out the window.

Frum: No, I’m serious. What should happen—Jeanine Pirro, a U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who’s leading the charge to bring these utterly ridiculous criminal charges against the head of the Federal Reserve to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve and subordinate monetary policy to Trump’s election needs. What should happen to her?

Brooks: Yeah. So first, I think the problem with the Biden administration, one of them, was that he said, correctly, “This is a battle for the soul of America”; he had no idea how to think about that. And then he should have read more neoconservative books ’cause they would have said, Here’s the soul of America. Here’s how it’s being destroyed. [Here’s] how you can restore it.

The second thing, and one of the reasons I’m not against going after these people as aggressively—when they broke the law, if they break the law, they should break the law. George Santayana, the philosopher, said that Americans don’t solve problems; they just leave them behind. And I think what’s gonna happen after Trump is that people are gonna take a look at corruption in Washington on an unprecedented scale, and they’re gonna wanna do what Americans did after Watergate: They’re gonna wanna turn the page. And in 1976, Jimmy Carter looked like integrity. And so it’s not like—and I actually think Gerald Ford did the right thing in pardoning Richard Nixon because we didn’t need to wage the same war over and over again. I thought the indictments of Trump during the Biden administration ended up helping Trump get reelected. And so I worry that that will happen again or that will just motivate the same battle lines over and over again.

Voters who voted for him, they have real issues, real concerns, which Trump is not addressing. The job is to win them over, not to lock them in the same battle lines as before. I think societies move forward the same way human beings move forward: through a process of rupture and repair. Trump has ruptured our society from top to bottom, and I think you just move on, you turn the page, and you offer something different. After Nixon, you got something different in Carter. After Carter, you got something different in Reagan. After Reagan–[George H.W.] Bush, you got something different in [President Bill] Clinton. And people want to try something different.

Frum: You make a very compelling case, and as so often, you’re almost certainly right. But let me just keep thinking.

One of the teachings of the neoconservative world was that these moral beliefs matter, that culture matters. And they were very impatient with social scientists who said, No, what matters are deep structures of wealth and power. They didn’t like that way of thinking. But deep structures of wealth and power do often matter. And so after Trump leaves office, it will still be true that the people who became corrupt billionaires under Trump will remain corrupt billionaires, with all the political power that that entails—including, by the way, Trump’s children, who have made a corrupt fortune in the single year of his first year of his presidency through these cryptocurrency operations they’re running, which have left every purchaser losing 95 percent of their money but have left the sellers very rich. That is not just wealth; that’s power.

The changes in the media landscape that have concentrated informational power in the hands of people who are beholden to the Trump administration, whether it’s the social-media companies or the new conglomerates in what we used to call television—I don’t know what we’ll call it [as we] go on—those will still remain. The changes that have happened inside the Republican Party, those will remain. People talk about doing something about these ICE recruits, but they’re still going to remain, probably, government employees with this rogue police force that doesn’t seem to answer to any kind of—that’s all going to be there.

And how do you say, Well, we’re going to re-moralize the society, when the structures of wealth and power bequeathed by what used to be there, where those structures are all still there, just waiting for the next economic downturn to take power? That’s what happened to Biden: He just assumed, Well, we can re-moralize society, he thought and forgot, well, if there’s a little bit of inflation in ’22 and ’23, all of this changes, and everything that was sinister before reemerges from the surface of the waters to claim new victims.

Brooks: Yeah, there’s clearly a lot of weight behind your argument. I think we all acknowledge that it was a big mistake not to punish any of the 2008 financial-crisis architects. That just struck people as a moral job undone. So sometimes you do have to have truth and reconciliation, with the emphasis on truth.

On the other hand, I think the big test for people in the years ahead is to separate Trump voters, working-class voters, from the Trump cronies. And I think that will happen (a) as people are realizing that the Trump cronies ride to power on the votes of the working class. And the working class die much sooner. They earn much less. They’re much more likely to get divorced. They’re much more likely to say they have no friends. So the needs of the working class are really something that needs to be addressed, and Trump is not doing it. And the job is to separate those working-class voters from the cronies.

The Republican Party in our lifetime, in my view, is always gonna be a working-class party. That’s true of every right-wing party in the Western world. What used to be the bankers’ party is now a working-class party. And it is a great achievement to become a multiracial working-class party, if the Republicans can pull it off. And so we’re not going to go back to the Republican Party that you and I knew in 1990. It’s gonna be a working-class party.

Frum: What does that mean? What do you mean when you say it’s going to be a working-class party? My sense of the Trump vote in 2024 was that the Trump voter was more affluent, on average, than the [Kamala] Harris voter. And while Harris did better among college-educated people than Trump did, that Trump was competitive and that noncollege voters are not always the same thing as working-class voters. They may simply be older voters who finished their schooling at a time when education was less prevalent than it’s been since the 1970s.

Brooks: Yeah, there are obviously a lot of Trump billionaires floating around out there. But if you look at the upper-middle, educated sectors of our society—whether it’s Palo Alto; Bethesda, Maryland; Westchester County, New York; Boston—those are all Democratic areas. And to me, the best predictor of voting patterns is no longer income; it basically is not a predictor of voting patterns anymore. It’s education levels. And Democrats are winning over the highly educated former Republican suburbs, and Republicans are winning over the less-educated working class in rural areas. And I guess I use working class a little loosely; I really mean education levels.

And it’s simply, that’s the divide not only in this country, but across Western Europe. And why is it the divide? Because the Information Age economy rewards education with money. And a lot of people look around their societies, whether it’s here or in Hungary or in England and in France, and they see the 20 percent most-educated people living in extremely affluent lifestyles, sending their kids to the same schools, replicating a caste system based upon education and inherited privilege, and, by the way, ruling working-class and conservative voices out of the media and out of college campuses. And if you tell people that one top 20 percent is gonna rig the game generation after generation, they’re gonna flip the table. And that’s why populism is not only an American thing. This phenomenon is happening everywhere in the Western world as we screw up the need to respond to the nature of the Information Age economy.

And so, to me, the central challenge is to separate those people from MAGA. And I think [the way] that is most doable is if we try to put Trump in the rearview mirror.

Frum: Yeah, well, MAGA is doing a pretty good job of separating themselves. And the tariff policy, which is essentially a tax on purchases of goods, and the less you make, the more of your income is taken—it’s a nakedly, upwardly redistributive thing—you combine that with the other things they’re doing, not just the tax cuts, but the destruction of tax enforcement in ways that favor those who own businesses. So for the affluent self-employed, paying taxes becomes ever more optional. For the people who spend their income on goods, taxes become ever more baffling and mysterious, and are included in the prices of the things you buy. So that’s doing a separation. And I think that the way that the Trump people have chosen to do immigration enforcement is destroying the prospects of the Republican Party as a multiracial party. So that work is being done.

But we are going to be left with, yes, many of the disaffections you described, but also with a governing elite, on the conservative side of the spectrum, that really has tasted the benefits of jettisoning democratic norms, jettisoning democratic institutions, and using violence as a tool of power. Do they unlearn those ideas from mere political defeat, or does something more need to happen? What does Irving Kristol tell us about that?

Brooks: (Laughs.) He would talk about the circulation of elites, that you can circulate elites pretty quickly. And all the people who were the elites in the Republican Party under George W. Bush, they thought they were gonna be in every Republican administration going forward, but that didn’t happen because Trump and Heritage Foundation and all those people brought in a new elite. CPAC, when I was a young conservative, was considered the fringe of the fringe, and it became the mainstream.

This is not unusual in American history. The people who were the elite under John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman were no longer the elite under Gary Hart and Bill Clinton. They had an entire shift in elites. And so you can have a shift in elites. And I’m hopeful that there is a group on the Democratic Party that is now acting like an elite, and I mean that in a good way. They’re running universities, and they’re trying to be less crazy-left than they were. They’re running institutions that they’re trying to reform. Isaiah Berlin, who I mentioned, he had a phrase, I find myself on the rightward edge of the leftward tendency, and that’s where I find myself.

Frum: The analogy I should have chosen was not lustration after 1989; it’s Reconstruction. That’s the American analogy, where the traditional governing elite of one of the great parties of much of the country committed itself to something not just in the defense of slavery, but to slavery-plus, fortified and amplified by treason. And until that generation has spent its 40 years in the wilderness, and a new generation has grown up, and the policies of the country have changed, and their victims have been brought into the political system—not just their disaffected followers, but also their victims—then you’re not going to have true stability again.

So I think, What are going to be the equivalents of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments that go into place to make sure not just that we put Trumpism behind, but so it really can’t happen again. And so the people who got rich and powerful, and who will remain rich and powerful, don’t use that wealth and power to attack American institutions in the way that the Trump people did in the first year of the second term, and looks like we got three more years to go.

Brooks: Yeah, let me try a historical example on you. So in the 1920s and ’30s, we had vicious anti-immigration movements. We had the America Firsters, and we had Father [Charles] Coughlin, who was sort of a radio priest who had semi-fascist and anti-Semitic tendencies. And suddenly, along came Franklin Roosevelt, along came the Depression, along came World War II, and they were just discredited. And they were discredited from 1941 to probably 2006, at least. And they were discredited not by elites; they were discredited by the whole country. You did not wanna say the phrase “America First,” ’cause that would discredit you. And along comes Donald Trump, and when he first started saying the word “America First,” I was like, What is he doing? Everyone knows what “America First” is. (A) I’m not convinced he knew what the original “America First” was, (B) people had either no historical memory or they didn’t care, and so ideas that were discredited came back. And that is the nature of politics: It’s never over. No argument is ever settled. They come back. But, to me, it’s not what a certain set of prosecutors do. It’s whether the mass of America decides: That was despicable. That’s discredited. We don’t want any piece of that. And you can learn that lesson.

Frum: That history is not going to repeat itself, because it took the Great Depression to discredit high tariffs, it took the Holocaust to discredit anti-Semitism, and it took Pearl Harbor and then the subsequent American triumph in two oceans and the complete collapse of fascist ideas in the fascist countries and the repudiations by the fascist countries themselves of their previous fascism. (Laughs.) And that string of things is so dramatic, it’s very unlikely to repeat. So it’s much more likely to happen that the Trump people are going to have a bad election or two. There will be some of the more selfish, materialistic plutocrats who will say, You know [what]? We overdid some things. We overdid some things. We shouldn’t have shot that woman in Minneapolis. We shouldn’t have done the tariffs so much. And if you wanna get rich out of politics, you should just have the deferred gratification to wait until you’ve left office, and then we’ll make you rich. Don’t do it while you’re in office; that’s just impulsive. And maybe less denigration of women and other minorities. And also, by the way, leave the anti-Semitism for the podcasters; don’t bring it into public. So those may be the lessons. But otherwise, good job, everybody, because what we’ve learned is that the system is much more vulnerable than anybody thought it was to authoritarian means for plutocratic ends, and let’s just get smarter for the next try. That’s what I worry is going to be the outcome, not the kind of grand repudiation that you got because of the series of catastrophes of the 1930s and ’40s.

Brooks: Yeah, one of the things I think about and worry about is, I don’t think we’re ever going back to a pre-Trump presidency, which we had presidencies that were self-restrained, and they were strained by norms; they were strained by laws. But the presidents, I would interview them all, and I asked one president on his final day in office, What’d you learn being president that you didn’t know before? And he said, I learned there’s a lot of passive-aggressive behavior in government. The president says something, and nothing happens. And those were the restraints that were built into the system. Donald Trump has shown you can crash through all those restraints, both the legal and normative ones. And I have trouble believing any future president is gonna want to give back all that power, and so, whoever wins, we could be walking into an age where presidential power is ramped up and congressional power continues to deteriorate, which is a primary distortion of our system of government.

Frum: David, thank you so much for making time. Thank you for sharing all this wisdom and history. I learned a lot, and I’m sure every viewer and listener did too. We’re grateful to you. Thank you.

Brooks: It’s great to be extending our lifelong friendship.

Frum: Thanks so much to David Brooks for joining me today. Now, as I mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is not a book at all; it’s a TV series, a four-part series on Netflix called Death by Lightning, about the presidency of James Garfield and his assassination at the hands of a killer named Charles Guiteau. It’s a delightful four-part series. I strongly recommend it. I enjoyed it enormously. Michael Shannon plays President Garfield. Matthew Macfadyen plays the assassin, Charles Guiteau. There’s both humor and heartbreak, and it’s really lovely. And I’m not here to be a total buzzkill about the series, just a little bit of one. There are some historical inaccuracies; I’m going to let them go. I’ll mention a couple of them.

When we first meet James Garfield, he’s working on his farm. He seems a man of the soil. You see someone far away from the dirty word of Washington politics, utterly surprised that he’s invited to speak at the Republican convention of 1880. You wouldn’t know from the opening of the series that he was, at that time, a ninth-term congressman who had just been elevated to the United States Senate (Laughs.) and whose main residence was a three-story townhouse at the corner of 13th and I in Washington, D.C. Okay, let that go.

Nor am I going to complain about the hilarious depiction of his vice president, Chester Arthur, as a thuggish boozer, although, actually, Chester Arthur was quite a gentle man and had been, in his day, a pretty serious scholar of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. I think he was one of the stars of his class at Union College in upstate New York, and he was made Phi Beta Kappa.

So now, I’m not gonna quibble about those things. But what I am concerned about is this show introduces viewers who probably don’t know that much about it to an important period in American history, but at the price of deleting what made the period important, what the politics were about. It shows a lot of very personal quarrels, and many of these quarrels were indeed very personal, like the famous quarrel between Senators James Blaine and Roscoe Conkling, which was driven very much by ego and mutual dislike. So, yes, that’s all true, but it obscures, because it’s just too difficult to explain, what drove the politics of the period. And I wanna talk about that today because it confronts us with the tragic choices that people in the past have faced and helps us to maybe understand or have some patience for the tragic choices that we will face in our own time.

James Garfield was elected in 1880. He entered Congress during the Civil War. And in the post–Civil War period—and he retained a seat; he represented the northeastern part of Cleveland, near Lake Erie. The Civil War left behind two great issues to face for the traumatized country.

The first was what to do for and about the population of freed slaves, who had been subordinated, dehumanized, abused, who now were to be granted their freedom, but what did that freedom mean, and how was it to be made real? The 13th Amendment outlawed slavery. The 14th Amendment granted civil rights. The 15th Amendment granted voting rights. But those rights were often attacked by violence, by the neighbors of the freed slaves, and it was going to take a big military presence to continue to protect the slaves and their rights. What was to be done about that? How are they to be made full Americans? Should they be made full Americans? Should the rest of America undertake the costs and sacrifices necessary to make them full Americans? Problem one.

Problem two: Before the Civil War, the federal government of the United States was a very tiny and slapdash affair, but it didn’t matter because the federal government didn’t do much before the Civil War. During the Civil War, the United States had become the most powerful military force on planet Earth, and even after the demobilization, everyone saw the tremendous latent power of the United States, both military and economic. But the government, much bigger than before the Civil War, was still a scandal. Jobs were given by patronage. The government was financed by tariffs that were kind of random and crazy and punitive. And all of politics was about distributing government jobs to people who would help the government, whoever won the election—usually the Republican—to win. There was no rational administration. Levels of corruption were extremely high. This all had to be brought into the modern era. That was problem two.

The great tragic choice was the political coalition that supported justice for problem one—that is, bringing the freed slaves fully into national life—was a very different coalition from the coalition that might exist to pull the United States government into the modern era. And politicians of the time were forced to choose. The so-called Stalwarts, who were the group around Roscoe Conkling, who was one of the characters in the drama, said, Our job is to try to bring the freed slaves into national life. Now, that’s gonna mean some very dirty politics—because this is not a popular cause in the Northern part of the country, certainly not after about 1873; it loses all its popularity. The only way we’re going to keep winning elections is if we use the tariffs to raise a lot of money from protected industries; if we use patronage and pork barrel to get a lot of votes and persuade people to vote for us even though they don’t like very much the things we’re doing for the freed slaves, but they like what we’re doing for them; and, above all, avoid anything that smacks of reform. It’s the old flag, it’s the old cause, it’s a Republican Party based in the Protestant small towns of the North, and we remain very suspicious of the Democratic big cities and certainly suspicious of the South. That’s coalition one.

Coalition two said, No, we need to modernize. We need to bring some rationality to the tariff system. We need to suppress the post-war inflation with a new kind of monetary system and a new kind of banking system. We need to have a much more professional government. And that coalition means making inroads into the Democratic big cities of the North, and that means, of necessity, jettisoning concern for the freed slaves. And the people who took this approach to politics, unlike the Stalwarts, who took the first, they were known as the Half-Breeds. And a lot of the battle of the 1870s and 1880s are these battles between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds. Should you have a Reconstruction politics, or should you have a modernization politics?

I’ve simplified this enormously, and people who are versed in the period will detect many errors of nuance and emphasis in what I just said, but that’s basically the problem. And without telling people who are long dead (Laughs.) what they should have done, understanding that problem helps us to understand the period and it helps us to understand ourselves because their choices were ugly, and our choices are often ugly too, and political success goes to those who best manage the choice.

Garfield became president in 1880, and inaugurated in 1881, not because he was a hero—he had been a very great war hero; he’d behaved very gallantly at the Battle of Chickamauga especially. But he was not a political hero. He was a person who balanced and served political expediency. There’s a scene in the series that, when you put it into context, shows what Garfield was and what he wasn’t.

So there’s a scene in the series where Garfield is visited by men, African American men, in what appear to be Union uniforms, and they appear to be Union veterans. And he says to them, “And I tell you now, in the closing days of this campaign, that I would rather be with you and defeated than against you and victorious.” Well, that’s very inspiring. That’s very inspiring. Did it happen? So I pulled off my shelf the 1978 biography by Allan Peskin and looked up the incident. And sure enough, it did happen. And those words were spoken.

But something else (Laughs.) then happened. So the people to whom he spoke those words were not Union veterans. They were a group of singers from Fisk University, an all-Black college, who had come to serenade him, and he thanked them for the serenade, and he gave them a little speech afterwards. And he ended the speech by saying those words that the series quoted: “And I tell you now, in the closing days of this campaign, that I would rather be with you and defeated than against you and victorious.” But when the account was written up for the press by Garfield’s political team, that sentence was suppressed (Laughs.) according to his biographer. They left that out because that would cost votes. They did not wanna say to everybody—they wanted to say to the people who were there, We’ll be with you. But to everybody else, mm, maybe not. Garfield was a balancer, as political leaders so often are.

As I say, I’m not here to be Captain Buzzkill about this. I enjoyed the show; I hope you will too. But I do think we need to look back on the past with a tragic lens because we need to look at our present with a tragic lens. And understanding the past better helps us understand—and its problems, and the unsolvability and difficulty of its problems—gives us more sympathy and pity for the people who lived in the past and gives us more preparedness for our problems in the present.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the weekend, the basketball star Breanna Stewart didn’t have her normal bounce during player introductions. As soon as the announcer shouted her name, Stewart walked out holding a white sign with a message: Abolish ICE.

“I think that when human lives are at stake, it’s bigger than anything else,” Stewart said at a press conference following the game with Unrivaled, a three-on-three professional basketball league she co-founded in 2024.

Stewart’s declaration was daring because it was also personal. Her wife, Marta Xargay Casademont, was born in Spain and is in the United States on a green card. The couple is working on getting Casademont American citizenship, and Stewart criticizing ICE so publicly could jeopardize her chances.

During times of political and social turmoil, the public often looks to athletes to speak out against harmful policies and actions that are directed at marginalized communities. Doing so can be risky: The Trump administration has frequently attacked and mocked athletes who challenge the president, and many team owners are among Trump’s backers.

But it can be worthwhile. Historically, when athletes have chosen to speak out, their advocacy has helped effect real change. The often-cited example of how an athlete can shift the political discourse is the boxing icon Muhammad Ali’s refusal to be drafted into the Army in 1967 during the Vietnam War. In more recent times, we’ve seen stark examples of athletes changing the political dynamic with their involvement. As I wrote two years ago, in 2020 we saw athletes participating in the George Floyd protests and driving voter-registration campaigns. In Georgia, WNBA players banded together to help elect the state’s first Black senator, the Democrat Rapahel Warnock—despite the fact that his opponent, Kelly Loeffler, was a co-owner of the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream at the time. Loeffler drew players’ ire when she criticized them for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. When Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot seven times in the back by Kenosha, Wisconsin, police that August, professional games across five different sports were postponed.

Jemele Hill: What happened to the politically conscious Black athlete?

Since 2020, there’s been a notable decrease in athletes’ social and political engagement. But now, with recent events in Minnesota, that 2020 spirit seems to be tentatively flickering back to life. For instance, earlier this month, when a federal agent killed Renee Good,  the Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers called her death a “straight-up murder.”

The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday seems to be pushing this dynamic further, and feels like an inflection point similar to the one created by Floyd’s death. At Sunday’s game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors, a moment of silence was held, during which people in the crowd yelled “Fuck ICE!” (The game had previously been scheduled for Saturday and was postponed, the league said, “to prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community.”) Every major professional sports team in Minnesota joined numerous businesses and corporations in signing a letter released by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce calling for “an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.”

The NBA Players Association also released a statement: “The fraternity of NBA players, like the United States itself, is a community enriched by its global citizens, and we refuse to let the flames of division threaten the civil liberties that are meant to protect us all.”

Besides Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, the All-Star point guard for the Indiana Pacers, and the NBA veteran Isaiah Thomas also made strong statements on X. Haliburton posted: “Alex Pretti was murdered.” Thomas wrote: “Yall had him out numbered and decided to KILL him like it was a video game and he can just [get] his life back smh.”

With a new poll revealing that more Americans support than oppose abolishing ICE, the rejection of the agency by some sports figures is part of a more widespread shift. The mood is not the same as it was in 2020, but some sports figures are starting to realize that silence in this moment is a betrayal of their own values.</div>

            <h2>ICE’s No. 1 Ally</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/ice-trump-minnesota-justice-department/685788/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday, the same day that federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti on a Minneapolis street, the Justice Department sent a letter to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The letter did not have anything to say about the violence caused by the Department of Homeland Security’s presence in the state. Nor did it offer Minnesota any assistance in the investigation of Pretti’s death or that of Renee Good’s just more than two weeks earlier. Instead, Attorney General Pam Bondi complained that Walz had “refused to support” DHS, insisted that the state cooperate more fully with ICE, and demanded that the governor hand over its voter rolls and records on Medicaid and food-stamp recipients. Walz had “better support President Trump,” Bondi declared on Fox News.

This abusive behavior by DHS has stood out in the chaos of Operation Metro Surge. But the Justice Department has done its part, too. It has shielded federal agents from accountability, launched needless criminal investigations into Minnesota officials and residents, and pumped out propaganda to aid the far-right press in justifying ICE’s tactics. The president has always treated DOJ like his own personal law firm. Now the department is acting like DHS’s law firm as well.

DOJ first undertook the role of ICE defender in Minneapolis in the days after Good’s death, on January 7. Video captured by the phones of both bystanders and the ICE agent Jonathan Ross showed Ross firing into Good’s car repeatedly, killing her and sending her car barreling down the icy street. In prior administrations, a death at the hands of a federal officer would have been cause for the Justice Department to begin a probe into potential wrongdoing by law enforcement. But this time, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced, “There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” Though federal and local investigators typically collaborate in the aftermath of shootings by law enforcement, the FBI blocked state and local governments from accessing evidence. When a journalist asked Trump about this development, he explained that Minnesota officials should not be allowed to look at evidence, because they are “crooked.”

Most galling, instead of probing Ross’s actions, the Justice Department decided to investigate the woman he killed. According to MS NOW, FBI agents in Minnesota drafted a search warrant for Good’s car to examine the path of the bullets fired by Ross, intending to carry out a civil-rights probe. But Blanche’s office demanded that they alter the warrant for use in an investigation of whether Good had assaulted Ross. (A magistrate judge denied the request on the grounds that Good was dead.) The New York Times reported that DOJ also considered launching a criminal probe into Good’s widow, Becca Good, who was with Renee that morning. Six prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota resigned in protest of the department’s handling of the case, along with an FBI agent who’d sought to open a civil-rights investigation but was rebuffed. Several attorneys in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division have since resigned as well.

After Blanche accused Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “encouraging violence against law enforcement,” DOJ sent out subpoenas to Walz, Frey, the mayor of St. Paul, the Minnesota attorney general, and the chief local prosecutor in Minneapolis as part of an ill-defined criminal investigation that seems designed chiefly to intimidate. This use of the Justice Department for political strong-arming has been unheard of since Watergate.

The department has also busied itself in Minneapolis with prosecuting residents opposed to what federal officials are doing in their city and immigrants trying to flee their pursuers, a tactic seen in other cities targeted for immigration enforcement. In Minnesota, DOJ has apparently run into a small challenge: Because so many attorneys there resigned over the handling of the Good case, the Justice Department has had to ask prosecutors from elsewhere in the Midwest to travel to the state to help out. Some of the cases filed so far do seem to describe potential assaults on officers, such as a pair of incidents in which two women are alleged to have bitten the fingers of the Border Patrol agents who were restraining them. Still, the Justice Department’s choice to focus on charging protesters, while enabling the violence by law enforcement that may have provoked them, is a telling indicator of its priorities.

Among the prosecutions of protesters, perhaps the strangest story involves a desperate quest by DOJ to bring criminal charges against the former CNN news personality Don Lemon. On January 18, Lemon documented a demonstration at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul by a group of activists, who accused a church pastor of also serving as the acting director of the local ICE field office. Just days later, federal law enforcement arrested three of the lead protesters. But prosecutors were unable to convince a magistrate judge to let them charge Lemon along with the other protesters. Instead of taking the hint and giving up, however, the Justice Department repeatedly tried—and failed—to bully judges into allowing them to bring the case. On Monday, the department indicated that it had dropped its effort to force the court to reconsider, but Lemon may not be in the clear. “We’re going to pursue this to the ends of the earth,” promised the Civil Rights Division leader Harmeet Dhillon.

DOJ’s obsession with pursuing charges over a single protest might seem puzzling, especially because this protest did not obviously break any laws or move beyond the bounds of protected speech under the First Amendment. As with the finger-biting cases, which featured prominently on Fox News, directing prosecutorial resources toward protesters who disrupted a church service helped amplify the administration’s portrayal of Minneapolis as a battle between godly crusaders for justice and pathetic yet demonic leftist agitators. The White House published a digitally altered photo of one of the defendants, Nekima Levy Armstrong, that both changed her stoic expression to a tearful one and darkened her skin. (Levy Armstrong is Black.)

This was the context in which Bondi sent her bullying letter to Walz on Saturday. “Accountability is coming. 🇺🇸,” she posted on X alongside a clip of her brandishing the letter on Fox News. Her post included no mention of Alex Pretti, who had died that morning.

George Packer: What should Americans do now?

After Pretti’s death, the Justice Department once again helped block off the scene from state and local investigators. This time, though, Minnesota and Hennepin County sued, and succeeded in convincing a judge to rapidly issue a temporary restraining order barring the federal government from “destroying or altering evidence.” The judge—Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee—convened another hearing on the matter on Monday, the same day that another Minnesota federal judge questioned a DOJ lawyer over Bondi’s letter during a hearing in a separate case. The state had pointed to the letter as evidence of the federal government’s effort to bully Minnesota into carrying out Trump’s will. At one point, Judge Katherine Menendez asked, “Is the executive trying to enforce a goal through force that it cannot enforce through the courts?”

Menendez has yet to rule. On Monday evening, Bondi celebrated on X that DOJ had successfully convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to pause a district court’s order barring federal agents in Minneapolis from harassing protesters. Still, the ground has shifted under the Justice Department’s feet in the days since Pretti’s death. Greg Bovino, the preening Border Patrol chief who wandered around Minneapolis posing for photos and lobbing tear gas at protesters, left the city on Tuesday, seemingly pushed out by the administration. With public anger mounting toward the White House’s deportation campaign, it’s not clear whether DOJ will continue its aggressive approach or back down.

Whatever DOJ chooses, though, any chance of it conducting independent investigations into the killings of Good and Pretti seems to have vanished. In response to the events in Minnesota, Democratic members of Congress have called for the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the public’s disapproval of ICE has surged. Any real reckoning must address the rot at the heart of the Department of Homeland Security. But it will have to address the rot in the Department of Justice, too.</div>

            <h2>What America Lost When It Lost Mother Fletcher</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/tulsa-race-massacre-victims/685785/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If recognition alone were capable of repairing harm, then the weeks surrounding the Tulsa Race Massacre’s 100th anniversary in 2021 might have begun to make the neighborhood of Greenwood whole. Oklahoma’s Republican and Democratic elected officials clamored to release public statements praising the commemoration. President Biden told an audience at Tulsa’s Greenwood Cultural Center, “For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness.” Having grown up in Tulsa, I found the pageantry of the centennial—the opening of a history center on Greenwood Avenue, the news crews that covered the events, and the concerts—unfamiliar, yet, for the moment, welcome.

The problem was what happened before—and has happened since: running down the clock on justice. At the time of the centenary, there were three living survivors: Lessie Benningfield Randle, Hughes Van Ellis, and his sister, Viola Ford Fletcher. That year, they had shared eyewitness accounts of the massacre with Congress, articulating claims for justice and redress rooted in ongoing harm. The three didn’t appear before the House Judiciary Committee with the expectation that Congress would intervene. Today, Randle, who goes by “Mother Randle,” is still alive. But Van Ellis died two years ago and Fletcher, who went by “Mother Fletcher,” died in November. Congress never did get around to direct reparations, nor did any other government body—neither the city of Tulsa nor the state of Oklahoma, which the three had sued for compensation—and now it’s too late.

The massacre began at night on May 31, 1921. It would go on to claim some 300 people, leave some 10,000 homeless, and raze more than 1,000 residences and businesses. Telling her story to the congressional committee a century later, Fletcher spoke of the massacre in the present tense: “I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lining the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burnt. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I live through the massacre every day. Our country may forget this history. I cannot. I will not.”

Read: How the Tulsa Race Massacre caused decades of harm

What the massacre destroyed, a century of disinvestment calcified. In Tulsa, dispossession unfolded not as a single event, but instead through the denial of insurance claims, the exclusion from public programs, the removal of homes through urban renewal, and decades of political pressure not to speak. Even a century later, Tulsa’s northern neighborhoods remained Blacker and poorer while the rest of Tulsa accumulated wealth. In parts of North Tulsa, home to Greenwood, the average life expectancy is approximately 10 years less than that of many parts of South Tulsa. And the data sour beyond these regional or neighborhood boundaries: Black infant mortality is three times greater than for white infants in Tulsa. Across Tulsa County, Black people, on average, live six fewer years and are twice as likely as their white peers to be unemployed.

Fletcher’s life would never be the same after the massacre. She told Congress that she lost the chance to study beyond the fourth grade. She spent most of her years as a domestic worker for white families, earning so little that even at 107, she told the committee, she could “barely afford everyday needs.” Her grandson said in a radio interview that for years, his grandmother would not let him utter the word “massacre.” According to him, Fletcher spent most of her life sleeping without lying down, fearing that she might, for some reason, need to make a quick escape. What many Americans saw as a historical event, she relived daily.

With Fletcher’s death, and the prospect of personal recompense answered, the question becomes what America will remember of that day. The country is well practiced in the art of forgetting. For much of my childhood, the massacre was not mentioned in my textbooks. I did not learn its scope in school. I learned about it only through references from elders and convoluted apologies by city leaders.

What I did not understand as a child is that this absence of public memory was not mere neglect. It was the profound callousness of a city ready to bury the past and then build on top of it. T. D. Evans, the mayor during the immediate aftermath of the massacre, instructed, “Let the negro settlement be placed farther to the north and east,” because displacement offered him the chance to potentially build a train depot and residential developments, as he hustled the city toward a future cleansed of the past.

But moving on from the past—without doing the hard work of repair—wasn’t just a matter of physical infrastructure. The legal system, too, played its part. In September 2020, Fletcher, Van Ellis, and Randle became plaintiffs in a civil case to redress the harms they had survived. By then, more than 100 Tulsa Race Massacre–related cases had already been dismissed on the reasoning that descendants didn’t have sufficient standing. To not repeat prior cases, the three pursued a public-nuisance claim, a legal strategy used to address ongoing harms that burden an entire community rather than a single past injury. The strategy—which Oklahoma had just tested in an opioid case, with early promising results—was designed not only to win damages but also to force the case into discovery, where the city’s role in allowing the violence would be made public. In their lawsuit, they claimed that the massacre could not be understood as an isolated incident but as one that kick-started ongoing suffering.

They still lost. The Tulsa County District Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2023, arguing that “simply being connected to a historical event does not provide a person with unlimited rights to seek compensation.” The survivors’ attorneys appealed to the state supreme court, hoping that the case might continue, only for the court to uphold the dismissal in June 2024.

As the legal process slowed, Fletcher’s persistence seemed to solidify. She intensified the pace at which she shared her story. She co-authored a book, Don’t Let Them Bury My Story, with her grandson Ike Howard, making her the oldest woman to publish a memoir. Fletcher and her brother Van Ellis obtained Ghanaian citizenship in 2023. Her story became not only a record of what she survived, but a call to others to take up the work that the courts said they could not.

Fletcher’s death shows us what’s at stake as 1921 recedes into historical memory. Without survivors to testify, the burden shifts to the rest of us to make the record whole and to insist that Tulsa’s story is not only an episode to be commemorated but a harm to be repaired.  Randle, Ellis, and Fletcher received adulation for their courage to speak out about what they experienced. They became, late in life, the subject of national recognition, because that’s what America is good at—celebrating survivors of the harm the country allowed, not compensating for the misfortune it has caused. The best America could offer these three and the community they watched burn was an investment plan, funded by philanthropy, not policy. Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols proposed a $105 million private trust, called Road to Repair, aimed at ameliorating the long-term damage of the massacre through scholarships, housing, and general reinvestment in Tulsa’s Greenwood district. None of the victims or their descendants received any direct reparations from the city or state. But for now, Road to Repair is just a plan—not a repository of funds ready to be allocated—to raise $100 million from private donors. Perhaps that’s the best that Tulsa can do: rely on charity to deliver some semblance of justice when our governments abdicate that responsibility.

Fletcher’s witness was never and could never be only about what was done to her, or to her brother or to Randle. The survivors’ lives bore the undeniable impressions of a community’s injury. Waiting her out, or her brother before her, does not end the obligation to repair. Greenwood is still there, and it has never seen justice.</div>

You have a camera in your phone, you have a laptop, makes no sense to buy a separate camera for use with the laptop.

If that&#39;s what the suit is about then it&#39;s a non starter as this functionality is older than either company&#39;s implementation. If it&#39;s about other features then who knows. It will depend on the specific claims as usual.

I suspect a lot of it is around camo&#39;s auto-framing, which apple calls center stage.  This is actually what i use camo for, and it&#39;s fantastic at it.  considering uninstalling it and getting rid of it now though, since there is no way this should be lawsuit material,

It is not just a WebCam. You can drag to move the view around with a virtual PTZ. Control smooth following of movement.

I could totally see how these features would have been poached.

Apple&#39;s sheer inability to utilize their own hardware would be, quite hilariously, an valid point of legal debate here I think.

That being said, can you actually justify the software developers for a company as big as apple NOT coming up with the items in question as a top feature to include?

yeah - i&#39;ve been usign camo for years, and honestly the auto-framing stuff that&#39;s like centre stage is the killer feature.  it saddens me that apple won&#39;t let me use center stage on my external webcam, because honestly it&#39;s actually a better implementation than camo, but... well, that&#39;s apple for you.

It was good while it lasted, but it is gone.

You can run your own shit on top of the existing network. But it will be a struggle to get anyone to visit because while incessant advertisement, marketing data collection, and social media content-tuning has ruined the Internet those things are also why the masses keep coming back.

It&#39;s like building a gingerbread house and then telling obese german children not to visit.

if AI is trained on mountains and decades of human data and thoughts and then you deem it &quot;woke&quot; derisively it says way more about you and your snowflake media bubble than the it does about the AI. you silly goose.

No, it&#39;s because the Gemini devs inserted a prompt telling it to make all images be inclusive and multicultural (e.g., woke).

and your evidence of this is what? crack pipe? it&#39;s your belief system so it just has to be true? reality can be whatever you want?

if i assume what you say is true can you admit that other AI&#39;s such as gpt and grok are tuned to the opposite direction and therefor no ai anywhere anytime can be trusted for anything because ultimately they are beholden to the code writers?

if we agree to that then lets all just shut up about gemini and shit and stop bringing up its opinions on anything because they dont matter

&quot;Woke&quot; AI? So what do you call Nazi-spouting Grok?

But good ideas are common. The question is whether it&#39;ll get implemented and used by enough nations to make a difference.

If the EU adopts this, which is possible as there&#39;s a pressure to move away from the US, then there&#39;s a real possibility that it&#39;ll make a difference. But one nation isn&#39;t nearly enough to push things over the tipping point. Especially with the UK and US governments determined to destroy privacy and internet security.

The internet is a public place. What you do there is public. The whole world can watch while you do. It is designed that way, and there&#39;s nothing that can change that.

He can come up with whatever pods he wants, with the user having absolutely control over how it&#39;s used. But he can&#39;t control what everyone else observes in that public place, and what they do with it. Advertising companies like Google and Meta will still surveille everything they possibly can (which is, increasingly, everything), collect every byte available, subject it all to their algorithms, and sell advertising based on it.

And once those massive databases exist in private hands, governments can, and will, compel those companies to fork it over for whatever purpose they choose, be it criminal investigation or political oppression or genocide. That is the inherent nature of government.

The only way for the user to opt out is to not be on the internet, which is increasingly crippling in today&#39;s world, because the user has no role in what happens in that public place other than just being there to be spied on.

Why do you think IPv6 has gone nowhere?  IPv4 and CGNAT is the most recent method of blocking participation.  You still need to access a server from a major company to do anything.

I keep a web server active not for popularity, nor traffic, BUT JUST IN CASE.

It&#39;s as &#39;free&#39; as a vps can be, which is to say nothing is &#39;free&#39;.

I can whack up a Raspberry Pi, LAMP stack or whatever, and it&#39;s maybe a $60 cost today, SD card included.

Access to the Internet? Never was free. Even ARPANet required data lines, not free. I&#39;ve used dial-up, DDS2, T-1/E-1, BRI, cable, fiber, none ever free.

It&#39;s hard to find people with Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s integrity. We should &#39;own&#39; our own lives. It&#39;s a lot deeper than just being watched.

hoopla about creating a super-intelligence, has no one seen the movie space odyssey 2001? Do you know what happened to the astronauts?

the other main problem is ISPs.  The fact that we&#39;ve allowed gatekeepers to set up their roadblocks to access is absolutely criminal.  Personally I&#39;d like to see them all in jail for the lies and misrepresentations they&#39;ve sold to us and to the gullible ignorant old men in the courts, who could not possibly understand the subject matter and yet who made their legal-force pronouncements all the same.

I didn&#39;t bother reading the article, but I did do something else: I looked up &quot;Solid protocol&quot; and tried to see what it is.

Originally I compared this to ATproto, but according to the Solid website itself  [solidproject.org], &quot;Solid is a file system for the Web&quot;. And that seems to be about all it does, it provides an API for storing data. It has mechanisms for handling encryption keys, meaning that in theory whoever runs the &quot;Solid Pod&quot; where your data is stored can&#39;t read it.

The problem is not that top level domain names were pounced on my charlatans.

Of the hominids. Thinking they will surely never go extinct, despite that having happened to the, what, 6 other alternatives?

I think so far it was dumb luck and a scale to small to wipe out everybody. But in the future it will require actually acting intelligently with a global view. Things do not look good.

At any given point in time, there seem to have been 4-6 different branches of humanity, with only one of these surviving to the next round (possibly occasionally more). There have been something like 5 different rounds in the past 2.2 million years. This suggests that between 20 and 30 different lineages of hominids have gone extinct. If some of those other lineages did successfully branch, then this figure goes up accordingly.

Homo Sapiens aren&#39;t a particularly competent branch. Most of the early innovation

Homo Sapiens aren&#39;t a particularly competent branch.Yes, they are.Most of the early innovation (art, music, symbolic thought, ritual) was done by Neanderthals and only later adopted by H. SapiensFlatly incorrect.
It is absolutely true that earlier hominids also dabbled in such things, but Homo Sapiens mastery of these things was vastly more sophisticated. This is evidence even in the initial migrations out of Africa of Homo Sapiens that colonized places that Neanderthals never tread, simply due to improve tool mastery.

That one is called &quot;denial&quot;. It inhibits fixing of actual problems and nicely proves the point you are responded to.

You&#39;re absolutely right that survival has been dumb luck by humans so far, and that acting intelligently and globally will be a requirement. Humans, I&#39;m sad to say, just don&#39;t show that kind of competence.Some humans do, but as a group, Humans merely show an impressive incapability of selecting good leaders. The few times it happens, it seems to be by random accidents.

Well, I guess seeing the &quot;Bigger Picture&quot; is not something you do.

Humans (homo sapiens) are late arrivals who inherited almost everything from earlier hominids and from lots of other animals who learned to use tools millions of years ago.

Using tools and making tools are very different things. The only species that actually manufacture tools are crows, humans, and chimpanzees.

Obviously if there were already hominids in Britain and Europe 500k years ago isn&#39;t it quite possible that more advanced hominid species such as Neanderthals, Sapiens and Denisovans and others evolved separately in place all around the world and that we can no longer assume Sapiens evolved only somewhere in Africa then spread out and highly diversified over a very short time frame -- 50k years or so?No.
The level of diversity is the proof.
There is more difference between 2 random people of the same &quot;race&quot; than there is between an average of 2 random races.
We have a single common ancestor, and it was recent.
The multiple-loci position is untenable due to the genetic similarity of extant geographically isolated populations.We know that the hominids migrated out of Africa about 1 million years ago, long before Sapiens appeared. So stop pretending that Sapiens didn&#39;t evolve from different sets of hominids separately in multiple places to a genetically compatible state. That DOES happen and it does a better job of explaining why Sapiens are so diverse today. Scientists frequently get things wrong and then refuse to recognize what is obvious. It&#39;s the structure of scientific revolutions...No.

In general, this viewpoint is spread by people who don&#39;t want to accept that they come from black folks. My buddy Matt used to argue this shit all the time.
It is wrong, and usually a sign of deep-seated racist views.

Amazon is in direct competition with UPS with their Amazon Logistics arm. My guess is Amazon used UPS to cover holes in their logistics coverage or for extra delivery capacity during holidays or Prime Day. In my city I haven&#39;t seen an Amazon package delivered by a 3rd party for probably at least half a dozen years. A decade ago in my area Amazon packages were regularly delivered by 3rd parties USPS, UPS and LazerShip. Not so much these days.Where I live, it&#39;s 100% Amazon delivery.

Those services wanted more money because Amazon stopped giving them the cheap-to-deliver city packages.  Unless they get fully automated delivery working, at some point, Amazon is likely to run headfirst into reality and be forced to work with outside shippers again and eat the higher costs.

Amazon is in direct competition with UPS with their Amazon Logistics arm. My guess is Amazon used UPS to cover holes in their logistics coverage or for extra delivery capacity during holidays or Prime Day. In my city I haven&#39;t seen an Amazon package delivered by a 3rd party for probably at least half a dozen years. A decade ago in my area Amazon packages were regularly delivered by 3rd parties USPS, UPS and LazerShip. Not so much these days.

Yes, you could help yourself to not attribute mistakes to malice. But it&#39;s more rewarding to find fault in others.

Amazon and their drivers do a pretty good job with delivery instructions. They deposit the packaged as requested snap a photo a leave.

Boy, I have the exact opposite experience. I know my UPS driver&#39;s name (and two of the alternates that occasionally sub for him).  If he has something that needs a signature for me he will either flag me down if I am driving or call me to get a verbal authorization. I still have his Christmas card in my car though since Amazon packages were eliminated-- I have only gotten one other UPS delivery in the past two months and he took vacation time that day.

Now we have three delivery trucks scooting around the place, Fed-Ex, UPS, and Amazon. Four if you count the post office which just dropped off a box yesterday. CO2 emissions be damned.

Last mile deliveries (in medium to high density locations) can be a sweet spot for electric delivery vans (the miles driven per day are modest, and they can charge (level 3) at the warehouse/depot overnight).

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

In the days since Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minnesota, Republican administration officials have been deploying torturous logic to defend the agents responsible and villainize the 37-year-old ICU nurse. Pretti had a gun when he encountered law enforcement on Saturday—which he was legally permitted to have in accordance with Minnesota law—and suddenly the Trump administration has decided the Second Amendment has exceptions. Seeming to lay some blame on Pretti for his killing, President Donald Trump told the press on Tuesday, “You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You just can’t. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that.”

This had already been a theme from his administration. Shortly after the incident, FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News that Americans cannot bring a gun to just “any sort of protest that you want,” while Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino went on CNN to say that Pretti’s Second Amendment rights “don’t count” because, in Bovino’s view, he was obstructing law enforcement officers. It’s worth noting that these positions stand in stark contrast to previous ones by some of these figures, including Patel, who described Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal for homicide after shooting someone at a protest a “victory for the Second Amendment.” Indeed, it did not take long for the reckoning, with far-right figures, the National Rifle Association, and scores of other gun rights groups publicly calling out the Trump administration for this apparent reversal.

“I’ve encountered countless police while I’ve been armed, and never been shot. The presence of a firearm, by itself, is not an indicator of a criminal intent or a threat to law enforcement,” said Cam Edwards , a prominent gun rights activist and host of the Bearing Arms’ Cam & Co podcast. Tim Pool, a virulent ring-wing conspiracy theorist, noted that video footage appears to show Pretti being disarmed and then shot at by federal agents. “I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool said.

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus was also quick to call out Patel’s assertion about Pretti’s decision to bring a gun with him on the day he was fatally shot, clarifying that “there is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota.”

And when California U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli repeated the administration’s line that approaching law enforcement with a gun gives agents legal justification to shoot you, the most prominent gun rights figures on X decided enough was enough. “Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the NRA retorted, to Essayli. Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, also responded by questioning the Department of Justice’s intentions. “I guess the Justice Department is back to targeting gun owners as domestic terrorists. You can want illegals & criminals off the streets and not want to see CCW permit holders get executed for ‘approaching’ law enforcement.”

In what appears to be an attempt to calm the blowback to the situation on the ground in Minneapolis, the Trump administration announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving Minnesota and returning to his old post in El Centro, California. However, among America’s conservative movement, the conversation over gun rights in the wake of Pretti’s killing is far from settled. To understand why, it’s worth considering the recent history of gun politics in the United States on the right. According to Saul Cornell, Paul and Diane Guenther Chair in American History at Fordham University, the Republican Party is not aligned on how it views the Second Amendment and in fact is facing three separate schools of thought that we’re seeing collide in real time.

As Cornell told Slate, there’s the libertarian wing that holds a sweeping view of gun rights, so much so it characterizes the right to defend oneself “as basic a human right as there is.” Then there’s the Christian nationalist view, which is also quite sweeping but believes only white, “pure blood” Americans deserve to bear arms. Finally, there is the old law-and-order bucket, which includes many Bush and Reagan Republicans who had a recent history of supporting some gun control.

Cornell offers that the Trump administration is seeking to revive the old law-and-order school of thought now that it’s convenient, and will largely get away with it. Pool, for his part, is already boasting again of his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying of federal law enforcement, “I’m not licking the boot. It’s my boot. I voted for it. I’m the one stomping.” Rob Doar, general counsel for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, conceded that the group was disappointed in the Trump administration’s response to Pretti’s death and it has created skepticism among those who support Trump. However, these members are “still overall pleased with the general state of things,” with Doar noting to Slate that the administration has intervened in court cases in favor of the 2nd Amendment, made gun-friendly policy changes within the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and on the whole been friendly to the 2nd Amendment.

In Cornell’s view, all the major figures in the conservative movement who may disagree with Trump now are more than likely to eventually fall back in line. “It’s hard to imagine those people are going to embrace telling people to bring their guns to ICE protests, right?” Cornell said. “Will this be the last we hear from the NRA? Or will they really harp on this and make it an issue? My suspicion is no, because it doesn’t help the Republicans” in future elections, Cornell noted.

If they’re willing to play “originalist jujitsu,” as Cornell characterized it, the Democrats still have a clear opening to use Republicans’ historical support for gun rights against them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attempted to do so after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Pretti did not have a Second Amendment right because he was carrying a gun. “The Trump administration does not believe in the 2nd Amendment. Good to know,” Newsom said.

Former congressman and 2024 presidential candidate Dean Phillips struck a more earnest tone. “For years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,” Phillips said, in a post on X. “Today I apologize, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”

Perhaps the most powerful approach is to simply point to the facts. Speaking to CNN about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in the hours following Pretti’s death, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted, “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse.”

The second Trump administration entered office with a theory. President Donald Trump, backed by policy architect Stephen Miller, believed that in a battle of political imagery between camouflaged he-men against leftist protesters, their guys would always win. Law and order would defeat chaos. Those trying to deport immigrants would defeat those trying to protect them.

In Minnesota, that theory didn’t just hit its limit, it exceeded it. Now Trump and his team are scrambling to cushion their fall as public opinion has turned on them.

The reaction of elected Republican officials, up to and including Trump, following the Border Patrol killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend has been markedly different from that following the killing of Renee Good, or any other scandalous episode involving immigration enforcement officials thus far. A broad swath of Republican members of Congress have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. Trump has removed Border Patrol wannabe-action-star Greg Bovino from his role leading the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears to be—at best—in administrative time-out. Trump has taken a suddenly conciliatory tone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey after weeks of treating them as useful left-wing foils.

It’s important not to overstate what’s happening. The administration isn’t suddenly coming out in support of open borders and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and on Tuesday, ICE continued operations in and around Minneapolis.

But all signals sure point to Trump wanting to get the hell out of Minnesota—or at least take pains to change the way the public sees the issue.

For the first time, the administration has taken its foot off the gas in its steroidal deportation agenda. After months of ramping up its interventions into blue cities starting last summer and marketing them with an almost trollish devotion meant to please the base, the antics devolved into killings, unaccountability, and lies about what people are seeing with their own eyes. With this devolution has come a turn in public opinion, with Trump’s numbers on his once best issue—immigration—tanking. The party finally found a level of public disapproval it couldn’t tolerate, and midterms are coming closer than you think.

The first memorable time that the administration flexed unnecessary muscle the way they did in Minneapolis was last June. A series of clashes between protesters and immigration agents performing raids around Los Angeles prompted the administration to federalize the California National Guard and send in hundreds of Marines. The administration liked the visual and sent Noem there for a photo op and press briefings. During a press briefing, California Sen. Alex Padilla was thrown to the ground by Noem’s security.

The administration did not offer Padilla an apology. Instead, as the California deployment and divisiveness it caused was underway, Miller was posting about how “California used to be a paradise” but that “mass migration has brought us to where we are now.” Miller at the same time was trying to rally energy beyond the lagging One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress, arguing grandiosely that its avalanche of fresh money for DHS made the bill “the most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World, in generations.”

After the Los Angeles operation, the administration federalized the Washington, D.C., police department and deployed National Guard members there, too, giving DHS agents room to ramp up their enforcement in the nation’s capital. (A man who hurled a sandwich at a federal officer was eventually taken under arrest by a swarm of 20 officers.) Elsewhere around the country, a raid on a Chicago apartment building in the middle of the night—featuring agents rappelling down the building from a Black Hawk helicopter—earned the administration plenty of controversy, but no apologies. When Trump was asked on 60 Minutes in early November about whether some ICE operations, such as those in Chicago, had gone too far, Trump said he believed “they hadn’t gone far enough.”

As the videos of over-the-top DHS tactics during raids continued to pile up, the administration stayed remorseless and itched for more fights. The Minnesota social services fraud scandals and the invective they directed at Minneapolis’ Somali population provided an impetus for “Operation Metro Storm.”

But even when an ICE agent killed Renee Good as part of the operation, the White House, the administration, and Republican elected officials showed no wavering from the party line. Good was accused by Miller and Noem of “domestic terrorism.” Rather than investigate the incident, the Department of Justice wanted to investigate Good’s widow. Vice President J.D. Vance, in an appearance in the White House briefing room, chastised the media for its coverage of the incident and described Good’s death as “a tragedy of her own making.”

But under the hood, the Renee Good killing—which a majority of Americans felt was unjustified—caused real political damage. Support for ICE’s tactics is in the tank, while support for abolishing ICE is growing. Beyond that, the high-profile nature of the Good incident and the administration’s outrageous responses to it made the president’s immigration policies not just something that a majority passively disapproved of; it raised the salience of the issue. And if there is one political issue which Republicans, already heading into a terrible midterm environment due to the cost of living, can’t afford to have as a top motivating issue working against them, it’s immigration. That is supposed to be their bread and butter.

So this time, when Alex Pretti was repeatedly shot after trying to help someone, and Noem, Bovino, and Miller tried to portray him as a would-be “assassin” or “domestic terrorist,” they were isolated in their approach. Trump fielded calls from senators and members of Congress over the weekend pleading with him to tone it down and pivot away from the Minnesota operation. The swaggering paramilitary incursions into overwhelmingly Democratic communities had at last succumbed to public opinion. Trump and a host of senators and Republican congressmen, surely with coordination, signaled deescalation in their statements and social media on Monday.

Ultimately, are they just going to tweak the Minneapolis model and try it somewhere else—maybe after a breather? Or is this the beginning of a meaningful retreat from the administration’s attempt to snatch every immigrant it can?

The calendar may dictate what comes next, at least in the medium term. The midterms are more front-of-mind now than they were in Trump’s first year, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see deportation operations select less hostile turf going forward. The Republican Party needs less widespread coverage of immigration raids gone awry, and the best way to have that would be to select fewer immigration targets likely to go awry. The more such incidents take place, the more the future of Trump’s mass deportation agenda—and Republicans’ hopes for holding congressional power going forward—dissipates.

The winds shifted this week after America watched Alex Pretti’s on-camera murder, on the heels of Renee Nicole Good’s on-camera murder, at the hands of Department of Homeland Security agents in Minnesota. Signs of cracks in the anti-immigrant right abound, from the alleged ouster of Greg Bovino from his role as “commander at large” of Customs and Border Protection to President Donald Trump’s TACO turn offering up an olive branch to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Republican luminaries who are usually content to deflect, attack, or ritually fellate the president in the wake of acts of lawlessness and violence have taken to the airwaves to condemn these public executions, with protests about them coming from the likes of Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, all of whom are demanding serious systemic changes in Trump’s immigration enforcement rampage. And gun rights groups have increasingly joined the chorus to contend that bringing a lawfully purchased gun out in public cannot be the basis for summary executions at the hands of federal officers. The CEOs of Target and other big corporations based in Minnesota seem to have unearthed something that looks to be a spine, calling for deescalation.

All credit—all of it—goes to the people on the ground in Minnesota; protesters, monitors, neighborhood patrols, independent journalists. As Robert F. Worth noted in the Atlantic, for all the MAGA talk of “domestic terrorists” and woke “assassins,” what’s emerged on the streets of Minneapolis is an organic, homegrown “meticulous urban choreography of civic protest,” a movement that is “leaderless” and “hyperlocal.” It has proven indomitable in the face of cosplay and photo ops and cartoon characters like Bovino and Kristi Noem. As Sherrilyn Ifill points out: “We all owe a debt of gratitude to the resilient and principled stance of the people of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota who have remained undeterred. They have fought for their neighbors and for themselves. They have stood in proud defense of their city, and their right to peacefully protest. The organizers on the ground have been extraordinary.” Adam Serwer calls it simply “neighborism.”

It’s going to be tempting to say that this week in Minnesota is the beginning of the end of something, but more likely it’s the beginning of something worse. Bovino and Noem in retreat is not the same as Trump and Stephen Miller in retreat, and there is genuine reason to fear that this moment of so-called symbolic compliance—a fleeting, symbolic retreat to stymy growing public resistance—will slow the roll of congressional inquiries, impeachment efforts directed at Noem, general strikes, and calls to defund ICE. Moreover, as Attorney General Pam Bondi’s not-so-subtle effort to extort voter information from Minnesota’s governor reveals, this cruel deportation dragnet is only half of the story; as ever, effort to undermine future elections is the goal. For every strategic Trump flinch and retreat, you can expect an equal and opposite effort to remain in power forever. With every threat of impeachment and accountability, the incentive to ensure a permanent MAGA majority forever ticks up, invisibly, but assuredly.

Which is why it is a mistake to think of these twin tragedies in Minneapolis as the horrific government actions that finally prompted shifts in politics, or law. Too much attention is always directed at opinion polling, craven political actors, and the levers of political change, and doubly so during this second Trump administration. This tendency to witness everything through the lens of “when will this be over for good” distracts from the real meaning of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, which is not how they died, but what they were doing when they were killed. This is what changed on the ground in Minnesota, and what needs to happen in Philadelphia and in Maine and in whatever blue city or state becomes the next target and the target after that. This transcends even the conversations about flipping the House in November. This is about what we are now learning, under immense pressure, and in real time, about authoritarian takeovers and how to resist.

For years we were told that voters didn’t care about protecting the Constitution or democracy, and they certainly didn’t vote on it. And certainly that appeared to be true in 2016 and again in 2024. But what we have seen spring up on the streets of Los Angeles and Portland and Minneapolis, and what we saw in the earliest No Kings marches, is that Americans actually care deeply about the law and the Constitution and democracy, and also—to borrow from testimony from Jack Smith last week—that those things have functioned so well in the United States and for so very long that many of us had come to take it for granted. For the last 15 years at least, after Citizens United, and Shelby County, and Dobbs, when audiences at speeches would ask me “What should I be doing?,” my responses tended to be carefully lawyerly and bloodless: court reform, gerrymandering reform, campaign finance reform. Repair and protect democracy and we could perhaps claw back its original sins as well as its distortions and degradations.

Well, it turns out it’s actually much more basic than that. What we are seeing amid the street protests, and the meal deliveries, and the marches and the legal observers and the calls for a general strike and for defunding DHS and impeachment for criminals, is actually all democracy work, and constitutional work, transmogrified and embodied into American streets and schools and small businesses. I was struck and moved by Robert Worth’s observation about what he witnessed in Minnesota: “Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution.” And if this is, in fact, the call, then what it might look like to answer it is no longer inchoate or mysterious. People are fighting and being assaulted and even murdered on their streets for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the 14th Amendment … This is a clawing back of the Constitution, amendment by amendment, on the streets, and by the people.

Those of us who believed ourselves to be part of the Trump Resistance in 2016 made the mistake of naming it without quite knowing what it was. Pink hats and marches that felt like street fairs and witty signs were for social media. This version of the resistance swallows that whole—law enforcement officials want to shoot you, and you will be pepper-sprayed while you are restrained on the ground. As DHS efforts to occupy and terrorize cities morph and expand, this won’t be “protest” as we once understood it; it will be something far more frightening, something familiar to historians of racialized policing. Yes, it requires, even demands, new rules of engagement. Legal and civil disobedience training are now essential, and there will be ample work to do in protecting vulnerable neighbors and neighborhoods. It turns out that it was only hard to articulate what needed to be done to protect democracy and the Constitution until it needed doing. And now that we know what democracy emphatically does not look like—tyrannical cruelty as part of an all-out demand for mass submission to authority and the subordination of the “other”—it has, overnight, become simpler to name and understand the mission.

This is why the most dangerous days are almost certainly ahead, but it helps to know that the courts, and most of the lawyers, and the blue-city mayors and the blue-state attorneys general and the neighbors and the teachers and the religious leaders, already know in their bones which side they are on. Democracy will not defend itself, in much the same way that authoritarianism will not just pick up its nasty toys of wars and go home. There is a massive shift taking place that has to do with resisting state executions of lawful protesters but also has as much to do with fighting for the core values laid out by the same imperfect streetfighters who founded the country. It is indeed the stuff of nightmares, but this is what democracy must look like.

Now we can name the mission, which is no small thing. Focus on the mission and ignore spectacle and spin. Of the many, many things that Trump and MAGA have misunderstood, almost foremost among them was the belief that Americans would forever be more interested in consuming white-supremacist online content than in creating actual democratic freedom. From Chicago to Portland to Minneapolis to your town, when someone asks you what they should be doing, the answer must be: Protecting the Constitution.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Come one, come all. Everyone from Russian and Chinese government goons to financially motivated miscreants is exploiting a long-since-patched WinRAR vuln to bring you infostealers and Remote Access Trojans (RATs).

The bug, tracked as CVE-2025-8088, is a path traversal flaw that affects the Windows version of the decompression tool. It received an 8.8 CVSS v3.1 score, and WinRAR patched the flaw in version 7.13 released on July 30.

Shortly after the release, ESET researchers who discovered and reported the vulnerability told The Register that Russia-aligned crew RomCom and at least one other criminal group exploited the security hole as a zero-day.

Fast forward to late January, and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) says several groups are still abusing CVE-2025-8088.

The exploit abuses Alternate Data Streams (ADS), a feature in Windows, to hide malware. Attackers craft malicious RAR archives with a decoy PDF or other file inside, and when a user opens the decoy file on a vulnerable version of WinRAR, the hidden malware writes files to arbitrary locations on the system.

&quot;Multiple government-backed actors have adopted the CVE-2025-8088 exploit, predominantly focusing on military, government, and technology targets,&quot; GTIG said in a Tuesday report.

These include RomCom, which is both a ransomware and espionage gang, and is exploiting this bug to target Ukrainian military and government entities using geopolitical lures. Three other Kremlin-linked crews - APT44 (aka Frozenbarents), Temp.Armageddon (aka Carpathian), and Turla (aka Summit) are also abusing CVE-2025-8088 to target these same sectors in Ukraine.

Also according to Google, an unnamed PRC-based group is exploiting the vulnerability to deliver PoisonIvy, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), via a BAT file dropped into the Startup folder, which then downloads a malware dropper.

Several financially motivated criminal gangs are also leveraging this vulnerability to infect victims&#39; machines with RATs and data-stealing malware. While the threat hunters don&#39;t name these specific gangs, we&#39;re told they include a group targeting commercial organizations in Indonesia, another group that targets hospitality and travel sectors via phishing emails with hotel booking lures that deliver XWorm and AsyncRAT, and a third focused on Brazilian users via banking websites that steals credentials.

Plus, as of January, &quot;we have continued to observe malware being distributed by cyber crime exploiting CVE-2025-8088, including commodity RATS and stealers,&quot; the security sleuths said.

Back in June, before the vulnerability was publicly known, a criminal who goes by &quot;zeroplayer&quot; posted an ad for a working WinRAR zero-day exploit for $80,000 on a cybercrime forum.

According to GTIG, this isn&#39;t the only exploit zeroplayer is selling to other criminals. &quot;Historically, and in recent months, zeroplayer has continued to offer other high-priced exploits that could potentially allow threat actors to bypass security measures,&quot; the researchers wrote.

This includes a sandbox escape, remote code execution (RCE) zero-day exploit for Microsoft Office advertised at $300,000 in November 2025, and a zero-day local privilege escalation (LPE) exploit for Windows costing $100,000 a month earlier.

In September, zeroplayer advertised a RCE zero-day exploit for a &quot;popular, unnamed corporate VPN provider&quot; without a price tag, and another zero-day for an unspecified driver that disables antivirus and endpoint detection and response software for $80,000. ®

            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no secret that datacenters use a ton of water for cooling, a demand that can strain local supplies. Despite reported internal forecasts showing sharply higher water use by 2030, Microsoft continues to splash cash on new AI bit barns.

The technology giant has been given approval to build 15 more server farms at Mount Pleasant in Wisconsin, reports say, near its existing AI datacenter campus, which Microsoft has said is on track to come online in 2026 and has billed as &quot;the world&#39;s most powerful AI datacenter.&quot;

The new project is expected to be worth more than $13 billion, with the facilities split across two sites just to the northwest of Microsoft&#39;s current campus, which occupies land once earmarked for a factory by Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn.

Local officials on Mount Pleasant&#39;s village board signed off on Microsoft&#39;s plans this week, according to CNBC, despite some pushback.

Elsewhere, the company has also disclosed plans to spend $30 billion expanding AI datacenters in the UK between 2025 and 2028, alongside a separate $10 billion investment in Portugal, saying it expects to more than double its datacenter capacity across 16 European countries by 2027, all to boost its ability to support AI workloads.

But all this comes at an environmental cost, as reported before, in terms of pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption. Microsoft previously conceded that its emissions were up by about 30 percent from a 2020 baseline, despite the company pledging to be carbon-negative by 2030, with the build-out of new datacenters cited as the cause.

At the end of last year, more than 230 organizations across America signed a letter calling for a moratorium on the construction of datacenters, claiming the current build boom represents a huge environmental and social threat.

Meanwhile, the New York Times claims to have obtained Microsoft documents showing forecasts for the annual water needs of roughly 100 of its campuses worldwide to more than triple to 28 billion liters by 2030, compared to 2020 levels.

These internal forecasts were reportedly made last year, and Microsoft told the newspaper it had updated its projections to reflect new water-saving techniques so that it now expects to use about 18 billion liters of water in 2030, up 150 percent from 2020.

Despite this, the cloud computing behemoth launched its Community-First AI Infrastructure initiative earlier this month, in which it pledged to minimize its use of the wet stuff, and even replenish more water than it draws.

Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith promised greater local transparency, saying that people deserve to know how much water Microsoft datacenters use, and that it is committed to making that information accessible and easy to understand.

That initiative was launched after President Trump took to social media to insist that big technology companies must pay their way, rather than ordinary Americans picking up the tab for the extra energy infrastructure needed for AI datacenters through higher bills.

It isn&#39;t just Microsoft that is building new facilities at a frenzied pace, of course, and the same criticisms can be directed at other cloud and datacenter businesses. But perhaps we aren&#39;t getting the full picture because of measures such as non-disclosure agreements that local officials are made to sign by some tech companies, as The Register recently reported.

Microsoft was asked to comment for this article, but had not responded by publication time.

The current boom in datacenter construction is only likely to slow if AI investment trails off or the current bubble bursts – which the Bank of England&#39;s Financial Policy Committee warned about last year. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hands On For all the buzz surrounding them, AI agents are simply another form of automation that can perform tasks using the tools you&#39;ve provided. Think of them as smart macros that make decisions and go beyond simple if/then rules to handle edge cases in input data. Fortunately, it&#39;s easy enough to code your own agents and below we&#39;ll show you how.

Since ChatGPT made its debut in late 2022, literally dozens of frameworks for building AI agents have emerged. Of them, LangFlow is one of the easier and more accessible platforms for building AI agents.

Originally developed at Logspace before being acquired by DataStax, which was later bought by Big Blue, LangFlow is a low-code/no-code agent builder based on LangChain. The platform allows users to assemble LLM-augmented automations by dragging, dropping, and connecting various components and tools.

In this hands-on guide, we&#39;ll be taking a closer look at what AI agents are, how to build them, and some of the pitfalls you&#39;re likely to run into along the way.

Before we jump into building our first agent, let&#39;s talk about what comprises an agent.

At its most basic, an agent is composed of three main components: a system prompt, tools, and the model. - Click to enlarge

In general, AI agents are going to have three main components, not counting the output/action they ultimately perform or the input/trigger that started it all.

For more complex multi-step tasks, multiple models, tools, and system prompts may be used.

If you&#39;re using a Mac or PC, deploying LangFlow Desktop is as simple as downloading and running the installer from the LangFlow website.

If you&#39;re running Linux, you&#39;ll need to deploy the app as a Docker container. Thankfully this is a lot easier than it sounds. Once you&#39;ve got the latest release of Docker Engine installed, you can launch the LangFlow server using the one-liner below:

After a few minutes, the LangFlow interface will be available at http://localhost:7860.

Warning: If you&#39;re deploying the Docker container on a server that&#39;s exposed to the web, make sure to adjust your firewall rules appropriately or you might end up exposing LangFlow to the net.

LangFlow Desktop&#39;s homepage is divided into projects on the left and flows on the right. - Click to enlarge

Opening LangFlow Desktop, you&#39;ll see that the application is divided into two sections: Projects and Flows. You can think of projects as a folder where your agents are stored.

Clicking &quot;New Flow&quot; will present you with a variety of pre-baked templates to get you started.

LangFlow&#39;s no-code interface allows you to build agents by dragging and dropping components from the sidebar into a playground on the right. - Click to enlarge

On the left side of LangFlow Desktop, we see a sidebar containing various first and third-party components that we&#39;ll use to assemble an agent.

Dragging these into the &quot;Playground,&quot; we can then config and connect them to other components in our agent flow.

In the case of the Language Model component shown here, you&#39;d want to enter your OpenAI API key and select your preferred version of GPT. Meanwhile, for Ollama you&#39;ll want to enter your Ollama API URL, which for most users will be http://localhost:11434, and select a model from the drop down.

If you need help getting started with Ollama, check out our guide here.

With LangFlow up and running, let&#39;s take a look at a couple of examples of how to use it. If you&#39;d like to try these for yourself, we&#39;ve uploaded our templates to a GitHub repo here.

In this example, we&#39;ve built a relatively basic agent to analyze spreadsheets stored as CSVs, based on user prompts.

This data analytics agent uses a Python interpreter and an uploaded CSV to answer user prompts - Click to enlarge

To help the agent understand the file&#39;s data structure, we&#39;ve used the Type Convert and DataFrame Operations components to extract the dataset&#39;s schema and help the model understand the file&#39;s internal structure.

This, along with the full document&#39;s file path, is passed to a prompt template, which serves as the model&#39;s system prompt. Meanwhile, the user prompt is passed through to the model as an instruction.

LangFlow&#39;s Prompt Template enables multiple data sources to be combined into a single unified prompt. - Click to enlarge

Looking a bit closer at the prompt template, we see {DATA_HEADER} and {DATASET_FILEPATH} defined as variables. By placing these in {} we&#39;ve created additional nodes to which we can connect our database schema and file path.

Beyond this, the system prompt contains basic information on how to service user requests, including instructions on how to call the PYTHON_DATA_PLAYGROUND Python interpreter, which we see just above the prompt template.

This Python interpreter is connected to the model&#39;s &quot;tool&quot; node and apart from allowlisting the Pandas and Math libraries, we haven&#39;t changed much more than the interpreter&#39;s slug and description.

The agent&#39;s data analytics functionality is achieved using a Python interpreter rather than relying on the model to make sense of the CSV on its own. - Click to enlarge

Based on the information provided to it in the system and user prompts, the model can use this Python sandbox to execute code snippets and extract insights from the dataset.

If we ask the agent &quot;how many monitors we sold,&quot; in the Langflow playground&#39;s chat, we can see what code snippets the model executed using the Python interpreter and the raw response it got back.

As you can see, to answer our question, the model generated and executed a Python code snippet to extract the relevant information using Pandas - Click to enlarge

Obviously, this introduces some risk of hallucinations, particularly on smaller models. In this example, the agent is set up to analyze documents it hasn&#39;t seen before. However, if you know what your input looks like — for example, if the schema doesn&#39;t change between reports — it&#39;s possible to preprocess the data, like we&#39;ve done in the example below.

Rather than relying on the model to execute the right code every time, this example uses a modified Python interpreter to preprocess the data of two CSVs or Excel files before passing it to the model for review - Click to enlarge

With a couple of tweaks to the Python interpreter, we&#39;ve created a custom component that uses Pandas to compare a new spreadsheet against a reference sheet. This way the model only needs to use the Python interpreter to investigate anomalies or answer questions not already addressed by this preprocessing script.

AI agents are just automations that should, in theory, be better at handling edge cases, fuzzy logic, or improperly formatted requests.

We emphasize &quot;in theory,&quot; because the process by which LLMs execute tool calls is a bit of a black box. What&#39;s more, our testing showed smaller models had a greater propensity for hallucinations and malformed tool calls.

Switching from a locally-hosted version of OpenAI&#39;s gpt-oss-120b to GPT-5 Nano or Mini, we saw a drastic improvement in the quality and accuracy of our outputs.

If you&#39;re struggling to get reliable results from your agentic pipelines, it may be because the model isn&#39;t well suited to the role. In some cases, it may be necessary to fine tune a model specifically for that application. You can find our beginner&#39;s guide to fine tuning here.

Along with the model, the system prompt can have a significant impact on the agent&#39;s performance. The same written instructions and examples you might give an intern on how to perform a task are just as useful for guiding the model on what you do and don&#39;t want out of it.

In some cases, it may make more sense to break up and delegate a task to different models or system prompts in order to minimize the complexity of each task, reduce the likelihood of hallucinations, or cost optimize by having lower cost models tackle easier pieces of the pipeline.

Up to this point, our examples have been triggered by a chat input and returned a chat output. However, this isn&#39;t strictly required. You could set up the agent to detect new files in a directory, process them, and save its output as a file.

LangFlow supports integrations with a wide variety of services that can be extended using agentic protocols or custom components written in Python. There&#39;s even a Home Assistant tie-in if you want to build an agent to automate your smart home lights and gadgets.

Speaking of third-party integrations, we&#39;ve hardly scratched the surface of the kinds of AI-enhanced automation that are possible using frameworks like LangFlow. In addition to the examples we looked at here, we highly recommend checking out LangFlow&#39;s collection of templates and workflows.

Once you&#39;re done with that, you may want to explore what&#39;s possible using frameworks like Model Context Protocol (MCP). Originally developed by Anthropic, this agentic protocol is designed to help developers connect models to data and tools. You can find more on MCP in our hands-on guide here.

And while you&#39;re at it, you may want to brush up on the security implications of agentic AI, including threats like prompt injection or remote code execution, and ensure your environment is adequately sandboxed before deploying them in production. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Things aren&#39;t over yet for Fortinet customers – the security shop has disclosed yet another critical FortiCloud SSO vulnerability.

Those hoping for a reprieve following last week&#39;s patch pantomime are out of luck. After users reported successful compromises of FortiCloud SSO accounts, despite being patched against an earlier flaw, the vendor confirmed there was an alternate attack path.

According to a security advisory published Tuesday, that alternate path was assigned a separate vulnerability identifier (CVE-2026-24858, CVSS 9.4), and the company disabled FortiCloud SSO connections made from vulnerable versions. Patches are not yet ready.

Fortinet confirmed that CVE-2026-24858, an authentication bypass bug, was exploited in the wild by two malicious FortiCloud accounts, but these were blocked as of January 22.

Customers of FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiOS, and FortiProxy are all affected and should upgrade to the version recommended in the advisory to restore FortiCloud SSO services. Some versions have safe releases available already, although patches are still in the works for most.

FortiWeb and FortiSwitch Manager are still being investigated for their exposure to the security flaws.

The original attacks were first spotted by Arctic Wolf around January 15, and seemed to involve two bugs Fortinet patched in December, CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719.

The vulnerabilities in question allowed attackers to bypass SSO checks using specially crafted SAML responses, and the observed attacks appeared to be using CVE-2025-59718 to compromise firewalls.

Fortinet confirmed on January 22 that the attacks were indeed bypassing that December patch, exploiting FortiCloud SSO, but doing so through alternate means. The patch was effective against one attack path, but not via this separate one.

Carl Windsor, CISO at Fortinet, warned at the time that although the attacks of which the company was aware only targeted FortiCloud SSO, all SAML-based SSO implementations were vulnerable.

The latest advisory states that the authentication bypass flaw can be exploited by an attacker, provided certain conditions are met.

&quot;An authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel vulnerability in FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer may allow an attacker with a FortiCloud account and a registered device to log into other devices registered to other accounts, if FortiCloud SSO authentication is enabled on those devices.&quot;

&quot;Please note that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in default factory settings. However, when an administrator registers the device to FortiCare from the device&#39;s GUI, unless the administrator disables the toggle switch &#39;Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO&#39; in the registration page, FortiCloud SSO login is enabled upon registration.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Anyone scanning the news might think it&#39;s pedal to the metal as far as AI agent implementations go, but there is a slump in rollouts as many organizations figure out what to do next, Redis CEO Rowan Trollope told The Register.

The company behind the Redis database, which built a following as a cache in cloud application architecture to become the most popular database on AWS, is trying to help users get out of the lab with AI agent projects and into production.

Earlier this month, Gartner forecast that investment from software vendors and cloud providers would propel a trillion-dollar increase in AI spending this year as investment hits $2.52 trillion. Enterprise users, however, are in the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; as reactions to enterprise project pitches go from &quot;that was a great idea&quot; to &quot;where&#39;s my revenue?&quot; the research firm said.

Trollope said the phenomenon was reflected in his experience of helping customers build projects implementing AI agent platforms in business.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen fewer examples of real successful production agents than I would have imagined [in terms of] anything outside of engineering,&quot; he said. &quot;It is still quite hard to do, and only the biggest companies in the world understand this is the future they&#39;re investing in. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to stop. They realize they need to have this next-generation platform.&quot;

Redis started life in 2009 as an attempt to build a performant key-value database. By late 2020, it was the most popular choice as a cache and message broker in cloud-native application stacks. Redis has since broadened its ambitions, adding features for machine learning and support for JSON documents in a bid to evolve beyond its caching roots. Now it is supporting AI implementations. Last year, it announced LangCache, a fully managed REST service designed to reduce expensive and latency-prone calls to LLMs by caching previous responses to semantically similar queries.

While Gartner sees a lot of enterprise LLM spending going to large application vendors as users seek low-risk options by upgrading software they already use, Trollope said organizations need to think about the range of sources they have to draw from to get AI agents to make decisions.

While Salesforce might store what discount you gave a customer and Workday stores information about employees, agents making decisions may also require information from email, instant messaging platforms, and other sources, he argued. Hence, organizations building out AI agent systems were using frameworks from Microsoft, Google, or LangChain, an independent engineering platform for building, testing, and deploying reliable AI agents.

&quot;The information needed to make the most relevant decisions is often not immediately obvious to the agent,&quot; said Trollope. &quot;For example, if I were to build an agent that is going to interface with my customers and allow it to do pricing, why and when is the agent allowed to make exceptions to the standard pricing policy? If all you want is the standard pricing policy, that&#39;s very easy, but you&#39;re not going to replace any human beings with that. What you need is to find out where the humans apply their judgment and what data they used to make that decision. That&#39;s where pulling that data together is difficult, because it&#39;s often unstructured. It&#39;s sitting in Slack threads, in email chains, in text messages. That&#39;s what we see as the number one problem.&quot;

The data requirements for AI agents to make meaningful decisions are part of the motivation for vector features in databases. A slew of vendors, including Redis and Oracle, as well as specialist vendors, are backing the concept. With a paucity of successful case studies, the jury might still be out on whether returns will follow. But Redis, at least, sees big businesses continue to invest despite the challenges. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SK hynix is surfing the AI hype wave by setting up what it nebulously describes as a solutions biz to further exploit the hysteria.

The chipmaker is already flying high on the back of booming demand for datacenters. Its share price has quadrupled in the past year as it supplies a vital component, one now in tight supply. Judging by its financials published today, the AI gravy train isn&#39;t slowing.

The Korean corp is launching a new subsidiary in February, referred to only as &quot;AI Company&quot; (AI Co.) at this point. It aims to become &quot;a key partner&quot; in the AI datacenter ecosystem to &quot;proactively seize opportunities.&quot;

The market is now seeing demand for integrated AI solutions that combine hardware, software, and services rather than just standalone products, SK says.

The Register asked for more information, but a spokesperson told us: &quot;AI Co. aims to serve as an optimized AI solutions provider for various industries by investing in the AI datacenter ecosystem.&quot; The plan is to focus first on software for AI system optimization, then gradually expand investments within the ​​datacenter arena, we&#39;re told.

Investment in other companies and technologies is also part of the circular AI economy. SK hynix says that &quot;solutions commercialization&quot; is one of the proposed business activities too.

SK hynix says it is committing $10 billion to starting the new operation. An interim management team and a board of directors will be named next month.

Shipments of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) aimed at AI servers are forecast to triple by 2027, according to Counterpoint Research. Unit sales are estimated to exceed 15 million by 2028, surpassing shipments of the datacenter GPUs that currently dominate AI processing.

ASICs are generally used more for inference, and are cheaper than high-end GPUs in terms of operating costs, but may incur higher upfront costs. Broadcom is expected to take 60 percent market share in 2027.

It will establish the biz by restructuring Solidigm, the existing California-based SSD subsidiary. Solidigm will change its name to AI Co. before transferring SSD manufacturing operations to a new subsidiary named Solidigm Inc.

One of the aims seems to be to continue promoting the &quot;chip technologies such as HBM&quot; that have helped propel SK hynix into the AI hype cycle.

Memory demand is &quot;materially outpacing supply,&quot; according to analysts at IDC, with chipmakers reallocating production capacity to favor components for servers and GPUs rather than consumer devices as prices rise across the board.

The effect of the memory crisis can be seen in the Korean company&#39;s latest financial results, with revenue for 2025 up 47 percent to ₩97.14 trillion ($67.9 billion) and Q4 revenue up 66 percent on a year ago to ₩32.8 trillion ($22.9 billion)

It&#39;s also good news for Netherlands tech giant ASML, which develops photolithography machines needed for chip production. Its calendar Q4 revenue of €9.7 billion ($11.6 billion) came in toward the higher end of previous forecasts, but the firm expects demand for its most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems to increase significantly this year.

None of this, however, seems to be good news for end users who face paying significantly more for anything that incorporates memory, including PCs and smartphones as well as servers and GPUs. Analysts predict that PC shipments will fall this year simply because there won&#39;t be enough memory chips to go round and prices will jump as a result. ®

            <div id="article-text">But that doesn’t mean your favorite artist made any more money.

But that doesn’t mean your favorite artist made any more money.

Today, Spotify announced that it had paid out more than $11 billion to the music industry in 2025. It’s an impressive-sounding number that’s a full $1 billion more than it paid last year. And, according to Spotify, that accounts for roughly 30 percent of the entire recording industry’s revenue. And, according to Spotify, that accounts for roughly 30 percent of the entire recording industry’s revenue. This figure, however, is purely a measure of royalties paid to the music industry and does not include merch or ticket sales, nor does it include audiobook royalties or podcasting deals.

However, it is important to note that this doesn’t mean that Spotify paid out $11 billion to musicians and artists. That money went to “rightsholders.” That includes labels, distributors, publishers, and more.

Spotify says that it doesn’t have insight into how much of that money eventually finds its way into artists’ hands. Agreements for individual artists can vary greatly. However, it’s not uncommon for an act on a major label to see as little as 15 percent of their royalties. Though indie labels typically offer much more favorable deals, with 50 percent or more going to the artist.

Spotify says that once again, roughly half of those royalties were paid to independent artists and labels. That includes DIY acts that self-release music through distribution services like DistroKid or TuneCore, as well as those signed to indie labels. But it also potentially includes library content and some so-called “ghost artists,” which have been the subject of controversy. Spotify’s Global Head of Music Communications, Chris Macowski, says the company doesn’t have more detailed data on how payouts to independent acts break down.

Macowski did say that over 12,500 artists generated more than $100,000 in royalties in 2025. That’s up from 10,000 in 2024. Spotify claims that is more than the number of artists being stocked on shelves in record stores “at the height of the CD era.” However, The Verge was unable to independently verify this claim, and Macowski was unable to provide sourcing at the time of publication.

Because royalties are calculated by dividing up a finite pool of money, the more songs that are streamed, the lower the per-stream payments are to artists. Unless Spotify decides to take a smaller cut of proceeds (it currently keeps 30 percent), the only way to grow that pool is to either grow its subscriber base or raise prices. Artists with fewer than 1,000 streams still receive no payout from Spotify.

In its post announcing the $11 billion in royalty payments, Spotify also teased future plans that seem aimed at addressing criticism it’s received. For one, it promises that “new solutions” are in the works to address scams, artist impersonation, and spam content. It acknowledges that “AI is being exploited by bad actors to flood streaming services with low-quality slop,” in an attempt to steal revenue from real artists, so it will be introducing changes to artist verification.

The company also seems to be leaning more fully into human curation in response to growing backlash against the algorithm. It said it will “bring more of the human voice behind that curation into the listening experience.”

None of that, however, is likely to quell the continued complaints from artists that Spotify pays less than its competitors.

Halide’s Mark III update includes HDR and ProRaw support for Process Zero, plus a new film simulation.

Popular iPhone camera app Halide is debuting a major update today: Halide Mark III. It’s been years in the making, and it’ll be available as a “Public Preview,” letting users get their hands on new features while design is finalized. This update includes the next iteration of the app’s much-discussed Process Zero mode, adding HDR and ProRAW support to what is intended to be a hands-off, anti-computational image processing method. There’s a new black-and-white film simulation that also supports HDR, and more new “Looks” to come.

This is my semi-regular cue to remind you that HDR is not a dirty word. We tend to associate the term with an over-processed look when high-contrast scenes are translated to an SDR display. But true HDR displays, like the ones on most modern smartphones, can display a wider range of tones, and image formats that support HDR can take advantage of this capacity for brighter highlights. Contrast can exist alongside highlight detail, shadows can be shadows, and everybody gets a pony. Or something like that.

That’s the HDR Process Zero is adding support for, so if it sounds antithetical to the whole Process Zero experience, maybe give it a try. In a related move, you’ll be able to shoot ProRaw in Process Zero so you can toy with a version of your image that’s been through part of Apple’s processing pipeline and retains more flexibility for tweaks after capture. Which goes hand-in-hand with another new Process Zero feature: brightness and shadow adjustments, called Tone Fusion. Halide’s blog post is careful to point out that it doesn’t use AI, and is less heavy-handed than Apple’s default processing.

If you’re looking for something totally different, Halide now offers its own monochrome film simulation called Chroma Noir, which also supports HDR that gives the brightest highlights a little extra pop. Halide’s blog post reminds us that film itself is a high dynamic range medium, and if you’re still allergic to HDR, you can turn it off anyway.

The Mark III update is available now; subscribers can toggle it on within the current app. The final update will be available free of charge to all Halide II subscribers. Halide is $19.99 per year, or $59.99 if you make a one-time payment.

They’re a great budget alternative to the AirPods Pro 3, offering solid noise cancellation, sound, and wireless charging.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

The AirPods Pro 3 may be on sale for $199 ($50 off), but that’s still a lot of money. If you want noise cancellation for less, fortunately you can buy the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation for $119 ($60 off) at Amazon and Walmart. That’s the cheapest they’ve been since the holidays, and only $20 more than their lowest price to date.

For the price, the AirPods 4 do a surprisingly good job of tuning out the outside world. While they don’t drown out noise as completely as the AirPods Pro, they significantly reduce ambient and low-frequency sounds on planes and in offices, especially when listening to music. In our testing, outside noise was easy to ignore even with the volume set to about 50 percent.

Beyond noise cancellation, the AirPods 4 offer the best sound we’ve heard from an entry-level AirPods model so far, with richer bass than previous generations. They also add a more robust IP54 rating for water and dust resistance and even boast a few Pro-level features, including wireless charging support, a built-in speaker on the charging case so you can track them via Apple’s Find My app, and crystal clear call quality. You also get other perks like support for live translation courtesy of an iOS 26 update, along with a natural-sounding transparency mode.

That said, they’re still the more affordable model, so you miss out on extras like a heart rate sensor, on-ear volume controls, and the ability to use them as hearing aids. Still, they deliver most of what people actually want at a much lower price.

            <h2>Beyond Meat’s protein soda might be its last chance and best hope</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/science/869209/beyond-meat-immerse-protein-soda">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ‘crisp and refreshing’ protein drink is a sign of a company running out of time to turn it around.

Beyond Meat just launched a new product that’s even further from meat than ever before: a protein soda. Beyond Immerse is the company’s first product that makes no attempt to replicate meat whatsoever, marking a sharp shift in Beyond’s business model. It might seem like it comes out of left field, but it all clicks into place once you know just how badly the veggie burger business is working out for Beyond. A pivot to protein is still a long shot for a company that’s never turned an annual profit — but it’s an attempt to tap into the one market left that might offer it hope.

Immerse is an oddity in and of itself. Unlike most protein drinks, which are usually chalky at best, it claims to be “crisp and refreshing” and comes in three fruity flavors: Peach Mango, Lemon Lime, and Orange Tangerine. Each flavor then comes in two versions, with either 10g or 20g of protein, at either 60 or 100 calories per 12oz can, with 7g of fiber either way.

As you’d expect from Beyond, Immerse is entirely plant-based. The protein comes from peas and the fiber from tapioca, with stevia, “natural flavors,” and a few juice concentrates and food colorings to round out the ingredient list. Beyond makes sure this ticks off a few more of the health food boxes, promising plenty of antioxidants and electrolytes too.

Immerse’s macronutrients are almost suspiciously impressive. I drink a protein shake most days, and 100 calories’ worth of my powder of choice would only net me 19g of protein and essentially no fiber at all, delivered in a semi-palatable sludge that I must try — and fail — to convince myself tastes like a milkshake. If Immerse can actually deliver better macros, and is as “crisp and invigorating” as Beyond promises, the appeal is obvious. Other people seem to agree. On the Beyond Test Kitchen site, where the limited first run of Immerse is exclusively available, every released flavor is already sold out.

Perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising. Protein snacks, drinks, and supplements are a big and growing business. US sales of ready-made protein shakes grew 71 percent between 2021 and 2025, and they’re now an $8 billion market. Much of that protein comes from dairy-based whey, but plant-based protein is growing too — sales of both drinks and powders grew 11 percent from 2023 to 2024 according to the Good Food Institute, making up a $450 million business in its own right. Those numbers pale in comparison to the larger “functional drinks” market — prebiotics, probiotics, fiber, protein, electrolytes, preworkout, postworkout, CBD, and more — that was worth over $200 billion in 2024 and is only expected to grow from here. The drinks fridge in my local store is overflowing with gut-friendly kombucha, cold-pressed ginger shots, and electrolyte-packed recovery drinks from brands big and small, with more every time I look. Poppi, a prebiotic soda that touts the benefits of apple cider vinegar, has drawn investment from Shark Tank, spent millions to run Super Bowl ads two years in a row, and in 2025 was acquired by Pepsi for a cool $1.95 billion (it also settled a class action lawsuit alleging its “gut-healthy” claims were misleading, but hey, it can’t all be good news).

If there’s one thing Beyond needs right now, it’s profit

You can see why Beyond wants in. It’s already got “pioneering expertise in unlocking the power of plants,” according to founder and CEO Ethan Brown, and is one of the few brands in plant-based food that can truly claim to be a household name. More to the point, protein drinks are clearly profitable — and if there’s one thing Beyond needs right now, it’s profit.

Beyond Meat was founded by Brown in 2009 and within a few years was generating excited headlines suggesting that the future of food was here. In 2019, Beyond went public; its shares launched at $25 each but rose to $65 on the first day of trading, making it the fastest-growing US IPO since Palm Inc. in 2000. A few months later shares peaked at just under $240 each, giving the company a valuation of over $14 billion. It secured supermarket distribution with Walmart, Target, and Kroger; supplied its fake meat to McDonald’s, KFC, and Subway.

But the glory days didn’t last long. Beyond has posted straight losses ever since it went public. Profit sometimes seems like an optional afterthought in modern capitalism, but if investors don’t see profit, they do expect to see growth, and that’s where Beyond has stalled: after a peak in 2021, Beyond’s annual revenue has steadily declined, down to $326 million in 2024. None of those fast food deals yielded permanent products on US menus. Beyond’s stock price has been in freefall for years, aside from a short-lived rally as a meme stock last October. It’s currently trading at below a dollar per share, placing it at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange, and is facing a class action lawsuit from its own shareholders, who allege it hid the need for a $77.4 million write-down of aging assets.

What went wrong? While Beyond Meat’s management have no doubt made mistakes over the years, really it’s simply the highest profile victim of a collapse in the market for meatless meat. The Good Food Institute found that US plant-based meat sales had dropped 7 percent from 2023 to 2024, marking the third straight year of decline. “The category is smaller today than it was two years ago, four years ago, five years ago,” Peter McGuinness, the CEO of Beyond’s chief rival Impossible Foods, told New York earlier this month. “That’s not good.”

In fact Beyond and Impossible have arguably done well by surviving so long, but both are struggling. Impossible has never delivered on long-rumored plans for an IPO of its own, likely put off by Beyond’s public problems, but has suffered repeated rounds of layoffs; last year McGuinness told The Wall Street Journal that profitability was likely years away.

By 2025, only 22 percent of Americans were trying to reduce their meat intake, down from 37 percent three years earlier

Both companies sit at the nexus of two major trends that are working against them. The first is that meat is back on the menu. The Good Food Institute notes a 4 percent decline in sales of plant-based foods between 2023 and 2024, while the Food Industry Association found that meat sales grew almost 5 percent over the same period, to a record $105 billion. The number of vegetarians and vegans has declined, with Gallup’s 2023 Consumption Habits poll estimating 1 percent of the US population are vegan and 4 percent vegetarian, down from 3 percent and 5 percent in 2018. But vegetarians were never meant to be Beyond’s whole market — it was supposed to persuade swathes of the rest of us to eat less meat in favor of plant-based alternatives. For a while it seemed to be working — by 2023, nearly half of US restaurants offered vegan menu options, and cutting back on meat consumption, especially to reduce climate impact, was at the core of the cultural zeitgeist. But by 2025, only 22 percent of Americans were trying to reduce their meat intake, down from 37 percent three years earlier.

That would be bad enough for Beyond, but it has a second problem: processed food is out too. And a patty of pea protein, oils, and starches, pushed through an extruder and treated so that it will appear to bleed, is pretty darn processed. Researchers have linked ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to 32 different harmful health effects, The Lancet has labeled them a global health threat, and San Francisco is suing processed food giants. Then there’s RFK Jr., whose new dietary guidelines include perhaps the only part of current American health policy I could get behind, urging Americans to limit highly processed foods (and, in a double whammy for Beyond, to eat more meat). There’s no real evidence yet of a decline in sales of UPFs as a whole, but anyone trying to eat more healthily right now is unlikely to be recommended Beyond patties. Instead they might be told to eat whole foods, to stick to snacks with fewer than five ingredients, to eat more meat but maybe cut back on beef. Beyond doesn’t enter the picture.

This all goes some way to explaining why Beyond has turned for salvation in, of all things, soda. Next time you’re passing a supermarket drinks fridge, take a look at the “wellness drinks” on offer. You know two things they almost all have in common? They don’t include meat (I hope), and they’re pretty heavily processed. Health-conscious eaters don’t want their food to be made in a factory or packed with preservatives, but rarely seem to mind when it comes to what they drink. My Instagram feed is packed with fitfluencers promoting “clean” eating and whole foods, while they shill branded discount codes for processed protein powders. There’s a double standard at work that likely won’t last forever, but as long as it does, you can see why Beyond Meat wants to take full advantage.

It’s unlikely that a protein soda, no matter how refreshing or fiber-packed, will turn Beyond’s fortunes round entirely. But right now it doesn’t need that: it just needs time. Time to persuade investors to stick around, time to pull the share price up by a buck or two, and maybe just time for food fads to change once more and give meatless meat a second life.

﻿Fauna Robotics’ Sprout encourages human interactions with an expressive face and a soft foam body.

A startup called Fauna Robotics has revealed a new humanoid robot called Sprout it’s been developing over the past two years. Standing around 3.5-feet tall, Sprout’s design, featuring a soft padded exterior, a wide head, and expressive mechanical eyebrows, was inspired by some of science fiction’s friendlier robots like Baymax and Rosie Jetson, the startup’s co-founder and CEO, Rob Cochran, told the Associated Press.

With articulated limbs and grippers for hands, Sprout looks ready to tackle dishes, tidy up around the home, or join a factory assembly line alongside humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas. But that’s not why Fauna Robotics developed the humanoid. It’s initially being sold to other robot developers, researchers, universities, and tinkerers who may not have the resources to develop their own humanoid platform.

Fauna Robotics says Sprout’s “movement, perception, navigation, and expression all work out of the box,” so that others can focus on developing unique applications for the humanoid instead of having to spend time teaching it to do basic things like walk. While it may be destined for labs and research facilities away from the public at first, Sprout was still developed to be approachable and function alongside humans. It’s lightweight, quiet, and was designed with “no pinch points or sharp edges” for safety reasons. It’s not folding laundry yet, but the potential is there.

While buying a Sprout may be cheaper than engineering a humanoid scratch, it’s still priced at $50,000, according to the Associated Press. That puts it well out of the reach of most consumers, but some of the startup’s earliest customers include companies like Disney and Boston Dynamics. It’s not known how much robots like Atlas cost, but it will certainly be a lot cheaper for Sprout to take damage from a bad fall than Boston Dynamics’ most advanced humanoid.

            <div id="article-text">Somewhere between the Pixel and the Galaxy there’s a perfect foldable.

Somewhere between the Pixel and the Galaxy there’s a perfect foldable.

A book-style folding phone is a gadget that poses one radical idea: What if you always had a computer in your pocket?

When you’d like to be writing a blog while your plane is taking off, and large electronics (Computer) must be stowed? When you’re sitting on the couch putting together a grocery order, and Computer is in the other room? When your job is to write blog posts, but you weren’t allowed to bring Computer into the keynote venue? These are real scenarios in which I’ve used the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 over the past month.

Each offers a large inner screen that is, at a minimum, lots of space for watching videos, reading posts, whatever it is you normally do on your phone. But I’ve been pushing them into Computer territory lately, with largely excellent results. The experience has only made me more greedy; I’m now seeing the different strengths and weaknesses of the Z Fold 7 and the Pixel 10 Pro — and I’m convinced that the ideal foldable is smack in the middle.

The thing about gluing two phones together is that the resulting device usually weighs about as much as two phones glued together. That’s true of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which is heavy enough to constantly remind you that it’s in your pocket. But the 10 Pro Fold has a secret weapon: Qi2 with built-in magnets, which allows you to use it with magnetic Pop Socket-type holders. I carried it with Google’s Pixelsnap-branded ring grip, which helps mitigate the weight issue when you’re holding the phone for a while. It kinda works as a stand too, and shouldn’t a phone that’s also a tablet come with a way to prop it up? I’m starting to believe so the more I use these things.

The 10 Pro Fold has one more feature that influenced my decision to bring it on my family travels over the holidays and to CES in Las Vegas (a literal desert!): dust resistance. Any phone that’s going to be my daily driver needs to withstand the harsh environment at the bottom of my tote bag, where goldfish crackers go to crumble and die. It’s the only folding phone with a full IP68 rating for dust resistance, which gave me real peace of mind every time I threw it in a bag.

But after a few weeks of lugging it around, I was ready to trade the 10 Pro Fold in for something lighter. So I switched to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung’s superthin and light foldable. It weighs a little more than a standard slab phone, making it much more comfortable to carry and hold. It doesn’t seem like much on paper, but I promise you — it’s a difference you feel in a hundred tiny ways.

Something about adding even a thin case to the Z Fold 7 feels antithetical to its whole deal

Since you can’t have everything, the Z Fold 7 lacks full dust resistance (it’s only sealed against large particles), so I felt a little more nervous with it day-to-day. Also missing: integrated Qi2 magnets. Samsung offers a couple of low-profile cases that add a magnetic ring, but I’m not a case guy. And something about adding even a thin case to the Z Fold 7 feels antithetical to its whole deal.

Maybe that’s just my hangup, though I can’t help feeling that a simple ring stand that I could slap on the back of this phone is just what it needs. Prying a case off when I want to reap the full benefits of the Z Fold 7’s ridiculously slim profile feels needlessly fussy when a simpler option is right there. A stand would also address the wobble the camera bump causes when you use the phone on a flat surface; I’m always propping the phone up on a drink coaster to stabilize it. I realize a case would help here too, but please see my previous points about being allergic to cases and wanting to easily ditch the propping mechanism at will.

While I’m out here running my own fantasy phone draft, I have some thoughts about software, too. I like the simplicity of the Pixel’s Android implementation, but I prefer Samsung’s easy permissiveness when it comes to running multiple apps on the inner screen. I installed Gboard on the Z Fold 7 and uninstalled most of Samsung’s excessive preloaded apps, which has been a much more pleasant experience than the one you get out of the box.

I realize I sound like a real complainer here. “Woman is Dissatisfied with $2000 Phone” is not a revelation anybody needs right now. And yes, I know that tablets exist, and I do not want one in addition to the phone I already carry. So if you’ll indulge me for a minute, I’m being greedy here because I’ve seen so much potential in these devices over the past few months. Folding phones have been cool from the start, but I’ve never been so convinced about their real-world utility as I am now.

I wrote an entire blog post from the Pixel 10 Pro Fold on my way back from CES when my laptop refused to connect to airplane Wi-Fi, but the phone obliged. I ordered our weekly groceries with Amazon open in a tab on one side of the screen and my shopping list in Paprika on the other. I published a quick post to this website from inside the Sphere! Being able to get away with that on a device that’s also water- and dust-resistant, that’s slim enough to fit into my yoga pants pocket, that’s light enough to pass for a normal phone, with a handy magnetic grip that makes it comfortable to use all day? That’s the folding phone promise, folks. I just wish there were one device that could fulfill all of those wishes.

            <h2>What AI “remembers” about you is privacy’s next frontier</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/28/1131835/what-ai-remembers-about-you-is-privacys-next-frontier/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year

Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.Although Google shuttered its high-profile internet balloon project Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost.

Omar Yaghi, is one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in October 2025 for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiralWikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed. But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

A startup’s ads for controversial embryo tests hit the New York City subway.

Why personalized gene editing, genetic resurrections and embryo scoring made our list.

A small group of volunteers will receive multiple injections of the experimental treatments next month, says Unlimited Bio.

An emphasis on fruit, vegetables, and whole foods is welcome—but it’s wrong to suggest steak and beef tallow should be prominent.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

            <h2>Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-27</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.

            <h2>Rainbow Weather raises $5.5M to refine real-time weather forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/rainbow-weather-raises-5-5m-to-refine-real-time-weather-forecasting">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <h2>Synthesia’s valuation jumps to $4B after $200M raise</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <div id="article-text">What: The European Commission unveiled EU Inc (“28th regime”), a single EU-wide legal company structure designed to let startups incorporate once and operate across all member states.
Who it affects: European startups & scale-ups, founders, VCs, international investors.
How: Reduces legal fragmentation, standardises corporate and investment structures, lowers friction for cross-border scaling.
Impact timing: Strategic impact now (capital & expectations), real operational impact from 2027–2028.

What: The EU proposed mandatory rules to remove and replace technology from suppliers deemed “high-risk” in telecoms and other critical networks.
Who it affects: Telecom operators, infrastructure providers, governments, Chinese tech vendors, cybersecurity supply chains.
How: Forces equipment replacement, raises capex, hardens security requirements across Europe.
Impact timing: Immediate policy impact, execution over the next few years.

What: European institutions publicly backed a strategy to reduce reliance on US technology across cloud, software, semiconductors and AI, often referred to as building a European “tech stack.”
Who it affects: US hyperscalers, European cloud & AI companies, policymakers, public procurement.
How: Shapes future regulation, funding priorities and government tech buying decisions.
Impact timing: Political and strategic impact now, regulatory and market impact medium-term.

This week wasn’t about hype:
EU Inc sets the future structure, high-risk tech phase-out enforces security now, and tech sovereignty defines Europe’s direction.
