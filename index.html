            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Brussels has warned TikTok that its endlessly scrolling feeds may breach Europe’s new content rules, as regulators press ahead with efforts to rein in the social effects of big online platforms.

In preliminary findings issued on Friday, the European Commission said it believed the group had failed to adequately assess and mitigate the risks posed by addictive design features that could harm users’ physical and mental wellbeing, particularly children and other vulnerable groups.

The warning marks one of the most advanced tests yet of the EU’s Digital Services Act, which requires large online platforms to identify and curb systemic risks linked to their products.

By constantly “rewarding” users with new content, TikTok’s design fuels the urge to keep scrolling and shift the brain of users into “autopilot mode,” the Commission said.

“Social media addiction can have detrimental effects on the developing minds of children and teens,” said Henna Virkkunen, the EU’s tech chief. “In Europe, we enforce our legislation to protect our children and our citizens online.”

If the provisional conclusions are confirmed, the social media platform could be fined up to 6 percent of its global turnover.

TikTok said: “The Commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us.”

TikTok is owned by China’s ByteDance, although a recent deal with the Trump administration will spin off its US arm into a joint venture majority owned by American investors. The venture will provide data and algorithm security, while ByteDance will retain control of the app’s main business lines in the US, including ecommerce, advertising, and marketing.

European watchdogs have previously taken action against TikTok for breaking the bloc’s digital rules. Last year, Irish regulators issued a 530 million euro fine against TikTok for sending users’ data to China, while Brussels has also probed its online advertising practices.

The EU’s move on Friday comes as other nations move closer to social media bans for teenagers.

Earlier this week, Spain was the latest country to announce it will stop access to social media for children under the age of 16 to curb the potentially harmful impact of online content on young people.

France and the UK are also considering similar measures, following the lead of Australia, which in December became the first country in the world to ban under-16s from holding accounts for 10 apps deemed to be potentially harmful to teenagers and children.

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.28 of the Rocket Report! The big news in rocketry this week was that NASA still hasn’t solved the problem with hydrogen leaks on the Space Launch System. The problem caused months of delays before the first SLS launch in 2022, and the fuel leaks cropped up again Monday during a fueling test on NASA’s second SLS rocket. It is a continuing problem, and NASA’s sparse SLS launch rate makes every countdown an experiment, as my colleague Eric Berger wrote this week. NASA will conduct another fueling test in the coming weeks after troubleshooting the rocket’s leaky fueling line, but the launch of the Artemis II mission is off until March.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Blue Origin “pauses” New Shepard flights. Blue Origin has “paused” its New Shepard program for the next two years, a move that likely signals a permanent end to the suborbital space tourism initiative, Ars reports. The small rocket and capsule have been flying since April 2015 and have combined to make 38 launches, all but one of which were successful, and 36 landings. In its existence, the New Shepard program flew 98 people to space, however briefly, and launched more than 200 scientific and research payloads into the microgravity environment.

Moon first… So why is Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos more than a quarter of a century ago, ending the company’s longest-running program? “We will redirect our people and resources toward further acceleration of our human lunar capabilities inclusive of New Glenn,” wrote the company’s chief executive, Dave Limp, in an internal email on January 30. “We have an extraordinary opportunity to be a part of our nation’s goal of returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent, sustained lunar presence.” The cancellation came, generally, as a surprise to Blue Origin employees. The company flew its most recent mission a week prior to the announcement, launching six people into space.

Firefly nears return to flight. Firefly Aerospace is preparing to launch its next 1-ton-class Alpha rocket later this month from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The Texas-based company announced last month that it shipped the Alpha rocket to the California spaceport, and a follow-up post on social media on January 29 showed a video of the rocket rolling out to its launch pad for testing. “Alpha is vertical on the pad and getting ready for our static fire ahead of the Stairway to Seven mission!” Firefly wrote on X.

Getting back on track... This is an important mission for Firefly’s Alpha rocket program. On the most recent Alpha flight last April, the rocket’s first stage exploded in flight, moments after separation from the second stage. The blast wave damaged the upper stage engine, preventing it from reaching orbit with a small commercial tech demo satellite. Then, in September, the booster stage for the next Alpha launch was destroyed during a preflight test in Texas. Firefly says the upcoming mission is purely a test flight and won’t fly with any customer payloads. The company announced that an upgraded “Block II” version of the Alpha rocket will debut on the subsequent mission.

China to test next-gen crew capsule. China is gearing up for an important test of its new Mengzhou spacecraft, perhaps as soon as February 11, according to airspace warning notices issued around the Wenchang spaceport on Hainan Island. Images from public viewing sites around the launch site showed a test model of the Mengzhou spacecraft being lifted atop a booster stage this week. The flight next week is expected to include an in-flight test of the capsule’s launch abort system. Mengzhou is China’s next-generation crew spacecraft for human flights to the Moon. It will also replace China’s Shenzhou crew spacecraft used for flights to the Tiangong space station in low-Earth orbit.

Proceeding apace... The in-flight abort test follows a pad abort test of the Mengzhou spacecraft last year as China marches toward the program’s first orbital test flight. The booster stage for the in-flight abort test is a subscale version of China’s new Long March 10 rocket, the partially reusable human-rated launcher under development for the country’s lunar program. Therefore, next week’s milestone flight will serve as an important test of not only the Mengzhou spacecraft but also its rocket.

SpaceX confirms upper stage malfunction. SpaceX kicked off the month of February with a Monday morning Falcon 9 rocket launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. However, the rocket experienced an anomaly near the end of the mission, Spaceflight Now reports. The rocket deployed its payload of 25 Starlink satellites as planned, but SpaceX said the Falcon 9’s second stage “experienced an off-nominal condition” during preparation for an engine firing to steer back into the atmosphere for a guided, destructive reentry. The rocket remained in a low-altitude orbit and made an unguided reentry later in the week.

Launches temporarily on hold... “Teams are reviewing data to determine root cause and corrective actions before returning to flight,” SpaceX said in a statement. A Starlink launch from Florida originally planned for this week is now on hold. SpaceX returned the Falcon 9 rocket’s payload fairing, containing the Starlink payloads, from the launch pad back to the hangar at Kennedy Space Center to wait for the next launch opportunity. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 team in Florida is now focusing on preparations for launch of the Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station, targeted for no earlier than February 11. The schedule for Crew-12 will hinge on how quickly SpaceX can complete the investigation into Monday’s upper stage malfunction. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

Amazon’s new booking with SpaceX. Amazon has purchased an additional 10 Falcon 9 launches from SpaceX as part of its efforts to accelerate deployment of its broadband satellite constellation, Space News reports. The deal, which neither Amazon nor SpaceX previously announced, was disclosed in an Amazon filing with the Federal Communications Commission on January 30, seeking an extension of a July deadline to deploy half of its Amazon Leo constellation. Amazon has launched only 180 satellites of its planned 3,232-satellite constellation, rendering the July deadline unattainable. Amazon asked the FCC to extend the July deadline by two years or waive it entirely, but did not request an extension to the 2029 deadline for full deployment of the constellation.

“Near-term shortage in launch capacity”… In the filing with the FCC, Amazon said it faces a “near-term shortage of launch capacity” and is securing additional launch options “wherever available.” That effort includes working with SpaceX, whose Starlink constellation directly competes with Amazon Leo. Amazon bypassed SpaceX entirely when it made its initial orders for more than 80 Amazon Leo launches with United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But Amazon later reserved three launches with SpaceX that flew last year and has now added 10 more SpaceX launches to its manifest. So far, Amazon has only launched satellites on ULA’s soon-to-retire Atlas V rocket and SpaceX’s Falcon 9. Amazon has not started flying on the new Vulcan, Ariane 6, or New Glenn rockets, which comprise the bulk of the constellation’s launch bookings. That could change next week with the first launch of Amazon Leo satellites on Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

China launches satellite for Algeria. Algeria’s Alsat-3B mission, an Earth observation satellite developed in collaboration with China, launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2C rocket on January 30, Connecting Africa reports. Alsat-3B is the twin of Alsat-3A, which launched from China earlier in the month. Algeria’s government signed a contract with China in 2023 covering the development and launch of the two Alsat-3 satellites. Both satellites are designed to provide high‑resolution Earth observation imagery, enhancing Algeria’s geospatial intelligence capabilities.

Belt, road, and orbit… In a joint statement, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the Algerian remote-sensing satellite project is another successful example of China-Algeria aerospace cooperation and an important demonstration of the two nations’ comprehensive strategic partnership. China has inked similar space-related partnerships to produce and launch satellites for other African nations, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Sudan.

Soyuz-5 launch set for March. Just a few months ago, Russia aimed to launch the first flight of the new Soyuz-5 medium-lift rocket before the end of 2025. Now, the Soyuz-5’s debut test flight is targeted for the end of March, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. Dmitry Baranov, the deputy head of Roscosmos, announced the new schedule at a scientific conference in Moscow. The mission from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan would mark the first flight of a new Russian rocket since 2014.

A reactionary rocket… Ars has reported on the Soyuz-5 project before. While the rocket will use a new overall design, the underlying technology is not all that new. The Soyuz-5, also named Irtysh, is intended to be a replacement for the Zenit rocket, a medium-lift launcher developed in the final years before the fall of the Soviet Union. The Zenit rocket’s main stages were manufactured in Ukraine, and tensions between Russia and Ukraine spelled the end of the Zenit program even before Russia invaded its neighbor in 2022. The Soyuz-5 uses a modified version of the RD-171 engine that has flown since the 1980s. This new RD-171 design uses all Russian components. The upper stage engine is based on the same design flown on Russia’s workhorse Soyuz-2 rocket.

Fueling test reveals leaks on SLS rocket. The launch of NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first flight of astronauts to the Moon in more than 53 years, will have to wait another month after a fueling test on Monday uncovered hydrogen leaks in the connection between the rocket and its launch platform at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Ars reports. The practice countdown was designed to identify problems and provide NASA an opportunity to fix them before launch. Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.

Hardware poor… Now, the second Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is on the cusp of launching a crew for the first time. Even as it reaches maturity, the rocket is going nowhere fast. It has been more than three years since NASA discovered leaks on the first SLS rocket. The rocket alone costs more than $2 billion to build. The program is hardware poor, leaving NASA unable to build a test model that might have been used to troubleshoot and resolve the hydrogen leaks before the agency proceeded into the Artemis II launch campaign. “Every SLS rocket is a work of art, every launch campaign an adventure, every mission subject to excessive delays. It’s definitely not ideal,” Ars reported in a story examining this problem.

SpaceX, meet xAI. SpaceX has formally acquired another one of Elon Musk’s companies, xAi, Ars reports. The merging of what is arguably Musk’s most successful company, SpaceX, with the more speculative xAI venture is a risk. Founded in 2023, xAI’s main products are the generative AI chatbot Grok and the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. The company aims to compete with OpenAI and other artificial intelligence firms. However, Grok has been controversial, including the sexualization of women and children through AI-generated images, as has Musk’s management of Twitter.

Lots of assumptions… There can be no question that the merger of SpaceX—the world’s premier spaceflight company—and the artificial intelligence firm offers potential strategic advances. With this merger, Musk plans to use SpaceX’s deep expertise in rapid launch and satellite manufacturing and management to deploy a constellation of up to 1 million orbital data centers, providing the backbone of computing power needed to support xAI’s operations. All of this is predicated on several assumptions, including that AI is not a bubble, orbital data centers are cost-competitive compared to ground-based data centers, and that compute is the essential roadblock that will unlock widespread adoption of AI in society. Speculative, indeed, but only SpaceX has a rocket that might one day be able to realistically deploy a million satellites.

Starship testing resumes. The enormous rocket we’re talking about, of course, is SpaceX’s Starship. Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, have rolled the Super Heavy booster for SpaceX’s next Starship flight to a test stand for a series of checkouts ahead of the flight, currently slated for sometime in March. This will be the first launch of SpaceX’s upgraded “Block 3” Starship, with improvements aimed at making the rocket more reliable following several setbacks with Starship Block 2 last year.

Frosty night on the border… This is the second time a Block 3 booster has made the trip to the test stand at Starbase, located just north of the US-Mexico border. Booster 18 suffered a structural failure at the test site in November, forcing SpaceX to scrap it and complete the next rocket in line, Booster 19. On Wednesday night, SpaceX put Booster 19 through cryogenic proof testing, clearing a key milestone on the path to launch. The next flight will likely follow a similar profile as previous Starship missions, with a suborbital arc carrying the ship from its South Texas launch base to a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. If successful, the test will pave the way for bigger tests to come, including an in-space refueling demo and the catch and recovery of a Starship vehicle returning from space.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, filmmaker Darren Aronofsky’s AI studio Primordial Soup and Time magazine released the first two episodes of On This Day… 1776. The year-long series of short-form videos features short vignettes describing what happened on that day of the American Revolution 250 years ago, but it does so using “a variety of AI tools” to produce photorealistic scenes containing avatars of historical figures like George Washington, Thomas Paine, and Benjamin Franklin.

In announcing the series, Time Studios President Ben Bitonti said the project provides “a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like—not replacing craft but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before.”

Outside critics were decidedly less excited about the effort. The AV Club took the introductory episodes to task for “repetitive camera movements [and] waxen characters” that make for “an ugly look at American history.” CNET said that this “AI slop is ruining American history,” calling the videos a “hellish broth of machine-driven AI slop and bad human choices.” The Guardian lamented that the “once-lauded director of Black Swan and The Wrestler has drowned himself in AI slop,” calling the series “embarrassing,” “terrible,” and “ugly as sin.” I could go on.

But this kind of initial reaction apparently hasn’t deterred Primordial Soup from its still-evolving efforts. A source close to the production, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about details of the series’ creation, told Ars that the quality of new episodes would improve as the team’s AI tools are refined throughout the year and as the team learns to better use them.

“We’re going into this fully assuming that we have a lot to learn, that this process is gonna evolve, the tools we’re using are gonna evolve,” the source said. “We’re gonna make mistakes. We’re gonna learn a lot… we’re going to get better at it, [and] the technology will change. We’ll see how audiences are reacting to certain things, what works, what doesn’t work. It’s a huge experiment, really.”

It’s important to note that On This Day… 1776 is not fully crafted by AI. The script, for instance, was written by a team of writers overseen by Aronofsky’s longtime writing partners Ari Handel and Lucas Sussman, as noted by The Hollywood Reporter. That makes criticisms like the Guardian’s of “ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering” in the first episodes both somewhat misplaced and hilariously harsh.

Our production source says the project was always conceived as a human-written effort and that the team behind it had long been planning and researching how to tell this kind of story. “I don’t think [they] even needed that kind of help or wanted that kind of [AI-powered writing] help,” they said. “We’ve all experimented with [AI-powered] writing and the chatbots out there, and you know what kind of quality you get out of that.”

The producers also go out of their way to note that all the dialogue in the series is recorded directly by Screen Actors Guild voice actors, not by AI facsimiles. While recently negotiated union rules might have something to do with that, our production source also said the AI-generated voices the team used for temp tracks were noticeably artificial and not ready for a professional production.

Humans are also directly responsible for the music, editing, sound mixing, visual effects, and color correction for the project, according to our source. The only place the “AI-powered tools” come into play is in the video itself, which is crafted with what the announcement calls a “combination of traditional filmmaking tools and emerging AI capabilities.”

In practice, our source says, that means humans create storyboards, find visual references for locations and characters, and set up how they want shots to look. That information, along with the script, gets fed into an AI video generator that creates individual shots one at a time, to be stitched together and cleaned up by humans in traditional post-production.

That process takes the AI-generated cinema conversation one step beyond Ancestra, a short film Primordial Soup released last summer in association with Google DeepMind (which is not involved with the new project). There, AI tools were used to augment “live-action scenes with sequences generated by Veo.”

In theory, having an AI model generate a scene in minutes might save a lot of time compared to traditional filmmaking—scouting locations, hiring actors, setting up cameras and sets, and the like. But our production source said the highly iterative process of generating and perfecting shots for On This Day… 1776 still takes “weeks” for each minutes-long video and that “more often than not, we’re pushing deadlines.”

Even though the AI model is essentially animating photorealistic avatars, the source said the process is “more like live action filmmaking” because of the lack of fine-grained control over what the video model will generate. “You don’t know if you’re gonna get what you want on the first take or the 12th take or the 40th take,” the source said.

While some shots take less time to get right than others, our source said the AI model rarely produces a perfect, screen-ready shot on the first try. And while some small issues in an AI-generated shot can be papered over in post-production with visual effects or careful editing, most of the time, the team has to go back and tell the model to generate a completely new video with small changes.

“It still takes a lot of work, and it’s not necessarily because it’s wrong, per se, so much as trying to get the right control because you [might] want the light to land on the face in the right way to try to tell the story,” the source said. “We’re still, we’re still striving for the same amount of control that we always have [with live-action production] to really maximize the story and the emotion.”

Though video models have advanced since the days of the nightmarish clip of Will Smith eating spaghetti, hallucinations and nonsensical images are “still a problem” in producing On This Day… 1776, according to our source. That’s one of the reasons the company decided to use a series of short-form videos rather than a full-length movie telling the same essential story.

“It’s one thing to stay consistent within three minutes. It’s a lot harder and it takes a lot more work to stay consistent within two hours,” the source said. “I don’t know what the upper limit is now [but] the longer you get, the more things start to fall off.”

Keeping individual shots short also allows for more control and fewer “reshoots” for an AI-animated production like this. “When you think about it, if you’re trying to create a 20-second clip, you have all these things that are happening, and if one of those things goes wrong in 20 seconds, you have to start over,” our source said. “And the chance of something going wrong in 20 seconds is pretty high. The chance of something going wrong in eight seconds is a lot lower.”

While our production source couldn’t give specifics on how much the team was spending to generate so much AI-modeled video, they did suggest that the process was still a good deal cheaper than filming a historical docudrama like this on location.

“I mean, we could never achieve what we’re doing here for this amount of money, which I think is pretty clear when you watch this,” they said. In future episodes, the source promised, “you’ll see where there’s things that cameras just can’t even do” as a way to “make the most of that medium.”

If you’ve been paying attention to how fast things have been moving with AI-generated video, you might think that AI models will soon be able to produce Hollywood-quality cinema with nothing but a simple prompt. But our source said that working on On This Day… 1776 highlights just how important it is for humans to still be in the loop on something like this.

“Personally, I don’t think we’re ever gonna get there [replacing human editors],” he said. “We actually desperately need an editor. We need another set of eyes who can look at the cut and say, ‘If we get out of this shot a little early, then we can create a little bit of urgency. If we linger on this thing a little longer…’ You still really need that.”

That could be good news for human editors. But On This Day… 1776 also suggests a world where on-screen (or even motion-captured) human actors are fully replaced by AI-generated avatars. When I asked our source why the producers felt that AI was ready to take over that specifically human part of the film equation, though, the response surprised me.

“I don’t know that we do know that, honestly,” they said. “I think we know that the technology is there to try. And I think as storytellers we’re really interested in using… all the different tools that we can to try to get our story across and to try to make audiences feel something.”

“It’s not often that we have huge new tools like this,” the source continued. “I mean, it’s never happened in my lifetime. But when you do [get these new tools], you want to start playing with them… We have to try things in order to know if it works, if it doesn’t work.”

“So, you know, we have the tools now. Let’s see what we can do.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/ai-companies-want-you-to-stop-chatting-with-bots-and-start-managing-them/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Anthropic and OpenAI shipped products built around the same idea: instead of chatting with a single AI assistant, users should be managing teams of AI agents that divide up work and run in parallel. The simultaneous releases are part of a gradual shift across the industry, from AI as a conversation partner to AI as a delegated workforce, and they arrive during a week when that very concept reportedly helped wipe $285 billion off software stocks.

Whether that supervisory model works in practice remains an open question. Current AI agents still require heavy human intervention to catch errors, and no independent evaluation has confirmed that these multi-agent tools reliably outperform a single developer working alone.

Even so, the companies are going all-in on agents. Anthropic’s contribution is Claude Opus 4.6, a new version of its most capable AI model, paired with a feature called “agent teams” in Claude Code. Agent teams let developers spin up multiple AI agents that split a task into independent pieces, coordinate autonomously, and run concurrently.

In practice, agent teams look like a split-screen terminal environment: A developer can jump between subagents using Shift+Up/Down, take over any one directly, and watch the others keep working. Anthropic describes the feature as best suited for “tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews.” It is available as a research preview.

OpenAI, meanwhile, released Frontier, an enterprise platform it describes as a way to “hire AI co-workers who take on many of the tasks people already do on a computer.” Frontier assigns each AI agent its own identity, permissions, and memory, and it connects to existing business systems such as CRMs, ticketing tools, and data warehouses. “What we’re fundamentally doing is basically transitioning agents into true AI co-workers,” Barret Zoph, OpenAI’s general manager of business-to-business, told CNBC.

Despite the hype about these agents being co-workers, from our experience, these agents tend to work best if you think of them as tools that amplify existing skills, not as the autonomous co-workers the marketing language implies. They can produce impressive drafts fast but still require constant human course-correction.

The Frontier launch came just three days after OpenAI released a new macOS desktop app for Codex, its AI coding tool, which OpenAI executives described as a “command center for agents.” The Codex app lets developers run multiple agent threads in parallel, each working on an isolated copy of a codebase via Git worktrees.

OpenAI also released GPT-5.3-Codex on Thursday, a new AI model that powers the Codex app. OpenAI claims that the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug the model’s own training run, manage its deployment, and diagnose test results, similar to what OpenAI told Ars Technica in a December interview.

“Our team was blown away by how much Codex was able to accelerate its own development,” the company wrote. On Terminal-Bench 2.0, the agentic coding benchmark, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3%, which exceeds Anthropic’s just-released Opus 4.6 by about 12 percentage points.

The common thread across all of these products is a shift in the user’s role. Rather than merely typing a prompt and waiting for a single response, the developer or knowledge worker becomes more like a supervisor, dispatching tasks, monitoring progress, and stepping in when an agent needs direction.

In this vision, developers and knowledge workers effectively become middle managers of AI. That is, not writing the code or doing the analysis themselves, but delegating tasks, reviewing output, and hoping the agents underneath them don’t quietly break things. Whether that will come to pass (or if it’s actually a good idea) is still widely debated.

Opus 4.6 is a substantial update to Anthropic’s flagship model. It succeeds Claude Opus 4.5, which Anthropic released in November. In a first for the Opus model family, it supports a context window of up to 1 million tokens (in beta), which means it can process much larger bodies of text or code in a single session.

On benchmarks, Anthropic says Opus 4.6 tops OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 (an earlier model than the one released today) and Google’s Gemini 3 Pro across several evaluations, including Terminal-Bench 2.0 (an agentic coding test), Humanity’s Last Exam (a multidisciplinary reasoning test), and BrowseComp (a test of finding hard-to-locate information online).

Although it should be noted that OpenAI’s GPT-5.3-Codex, released the same day, seemingly reclaimed the lead on Terminal-Bench. On ARC AGI 2, which attempts to test the ability to solve problems that are easy for humans but hard for AI models, Opus 4.6 scored 68.8 percent, compared to 37.6 percent for Opus 4.5, 54.2 percent for GPT-5.2, and 45.1 percent for Gemini 3 Pro.

As always, take AI benchmarks with a grain of salt, since objectively measuring AI model capabilities is a relatively new and unsettled science.

Anthropic also said that on a long-context retrieval benchmark called MRCR v2, Opus 4.6 scored 76 percent on the 1 million-token variant, compared to 18.5 percent for its Sonnet 4.5 model. That gap matters for the agent teams use case, since agents working across large codebases need to track information across hundreds of thousands of tokens without losing the thread.

Pricing for the API stays the same as Opus 4.5 at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with a premium rate of $10/$37.50 for prompts that exceed 200,000 tokens. Opus 4.6 is available on claude.ai, the Claude API, and all major cloud platforms.

These releases occurred during a week of exceptional volatility for software stocks. On January 30, Anthropic released 11 open source plugins for Cowork, its agentic productivity tool that launched on January 12. Cowork itself is a general-purpose tool that gives Claude access to local folders for work tasks, but the plugins extended it into specific professional domains: legal contract review, non-disclosure agreement triage, compliance workflows, financial analysis, sales, and marketing.

By Tuesday, investors reportedly reacted to the release by erasing roughly $285 billion in market value across software, financial services, and asset management stocks. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks fell 6 percent that day, its steepest single-session decline since April’s tariff-driven sell-off. Thomson Reuters led the rout with an 18 percent drop, and the pain spread to European and Asian markets.

The purported fear among investors centers on AI model companies packaging complete workflows that compete with established software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors, even if the verdict is still out on whether these tools can achieve those tasks.

OpenAI’s Frontier might deepen that concern: its stated design lets AI agents log in to applications, execute tasks, and manage work with minimal human involvement, which Fortune described as a bid to become “the operating system of the enterprise.” OpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo pushed back on the idea that Frontier replaces existing software, telling reporters, “Frontier is really a recognition that we’re not going to build everything ourselves.”

Whether these co-working apps actually live up to their billing or not, the convergence is hard to miss. Anthropic’s Scott White, the company’s head of product for enterprise, gave the practice a name that is likely to roll a few eyes. “Everybody has seen this transformation happen with software engineering in the last year and a half, where vibe coding started to exist as a concept, and people could now do things with their ideas,” White told CNBC. “I think that we are now transitioning almost into vibe working.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2018, we lamented as Nintendo officially replaced the Virtual Console—its long-running line of downloadable classic games on the Wii and Wii U—with time-limited access to a set of games through a paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Now, Hamster Corporation is doing what Nintendo no longer will by offering downloadable versions of retro console games for direct individual purchase on the Switch 2.

As part of today’s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, Hamster announced a new Console Archives line of emulated classics available for download starting today on the Switch 2 and next week on the PlayStation 5 (sorry, Xbox and OG Switch fans). So far that lineup only includes the original PlayStation snowboarding title Cool Boarders for $12 and the NES action platformer Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos for $8, but Hamster promises more obscure games, including Doraemon and Sonic Wings Special, will be available in the future.

If the name Hamster Corporation sounds familiar, it’s because the company is behind the Arcade Archive series, which has repackaged individual arcade games for purchase and emulated play on modern consoles since 2014. That effort, which celebrated its 500th release in December, even includes some of Nintendo’s classic arcade titles, which the Switch-maker never officially released on the original Virtual Console.

Now Hamster’s says it is expanding its efforts “with the concept of faithfully reproducing masterpieces released on various home game consoles, allowing players to easily enjoy them on the latest hardware.” While these new offerings are more bare-bones than the full-fledged interactive museums released by the likes of Digital Eclipse, they still include a few modern features, such as customizable button layouts, screen settings, and the ability to save and load at any time.

Hamster says on its website that it “would like to port and release as many games as possible,” practically begging “those of you who own the rights to the games, please let us release your games” by licensing or outright selling the rights.

“We believe it is very important to pass this on to future generations around the world, and to create an environment where anyone can play it anytime, anywhere,” Hamster writes. “Everyone has different memories of games. We aim to release as many titles as possible so that people can rediscover and play the games that evoke fond memories of the time they played them.”

Incidentally, Ninja Gaiden II was previously offered on the Wii Virtual Console back in 2007 and again on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2016. Both releases cost just $5 at the time, but the shutdown of Nintendo’s Wii and Wii U eShops means the game is no longer available for purchase on those defunct platforms. Thank goodness, then, that Hamster is offering an opportunity to purchase the game for the third time in as many decades on yet another new console. Fully portable ROMs of the game are just way too convenient to purchase, you know?</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, OpenAI announced GPT-5.3-Codex, a new version of its frontier coding model that will be available via the command line, IDE extension, web interface, and the new macOS desktop app. (No API access yet, but it’s coming.)

GPT-5.3-Codex outperforms GPT-5.2-Codex and GPT-5.2 in SWE-Bench Pro, Terminal-Bench 2.0, and other benchmarks, according to the company’s testing.

There are already a few headlines out there saying “Codex built itself,” but let’s reality-check that, as that’s an overstatement. The domains OpenAI described using it for here are similar to the ones you see in some other enterprise software development firms now: managing deployments, debugging, and handling test results and evaluations. There is no claim here that GPT-5.3-Codex built itself.

Instead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex was “instrumental in creating itself.” You can read more about what that means in the company’s blog post.

But that’s part of the pitch with this model update—OpenAI is trying to position Codex as a tool that does more than generate lines of code. The goal is to make it useful for “all of the work in the software lifecycle—debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing PRDs, editing copy, user research, tests, metrics, and more.” There’s also an emphasis on steering the model mid-task and frequent status updates.

It’s worth mentioning that the general-purpose ChatGPT model is still the version numbered 5.2. With Codex moving to 5.3, OpenAI may be planning a similar update for ChatGPT in the near future, but nothing has been announced yet.

There are no announced changes to limits or pricing with this model, but OpenAI says that, as of this update, models will run 25 percent faster for Codex users, “thanks to improvements in our infrastructure and inference stack.”

OpenAI also notes that “what’s next” for Codex is “moving beyond writing code to using it as a tool to operate a computer and get real work done end to end.” That’s something that people have already been using these tools for via MCP and other methods, and which Anthropic started rolling out with Claude Cowork a few weeks back.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo has established itself as the autonomous ride-hailing service to beat, operating a fleet of several thousand self-driving taxis across the United States, with active services in ten major metropolitan areas.

That “self-driving” may be due for some extra scrutiny, though. During a Congressional hearing on Wednesday, Waymo’s chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña, was grilled over the company’s use of Chinese-made vehicles and reliance on overseas workers, as Business Insider reports.

The stakes and public safety implications are considerable. The news comes roughly a week after a Waymo robotaxi struck and injured a child near a Santa Monica, California, elementary school, triggering a federal probe.

After being pressed for a breakdown on where these overseas operators operate, Peña said he didn’t have those stats, explaining that some operators live in the US, but others live much further away, including in the Philippines.

“They provide guidance,” he argued. “They do not remotely drive the vehicles. Waymo asks for guidance in certain situations and gets an input, but the Waymo vehicle is always in charge of the dynamic driving tasks, so that is just one additional input.”

The admission didn’t sit well with senator Ed Markey (D-MA), who argued that “having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue.”

“The information the operators receive could be out of date. It could introduce tremendous cybersecurity vulnerabilities,” he argued. “We don’t know if these people have US driver’s licenses.”

“It’s one thing when a taxi is replaced by an Uber or a Lyft,” Markey concluded. “It’s another thing when the jobs just go completely overseas.”

Waymo has been fairly upfront about its human operators. In a May 2024 blog post, the company compared it to a “phone-a-friend.”

“When the Waymo vehicle encounters a particular situation on the road, the autonomous driver can reach out to a human fleet response agent for additional information to contextualize its environment,” the post reads. “The Waymo Driver [software] does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times.”

In case the car’s driving software encounters something atypical, it may choose to send a request to a human fleet response agent, who then can help out by viewing real-time feeds from the vehicle’s exterior cameras.

While that may sound like the remote operator isn’t directly controlling the vehicle’s driving responses, it nonetheless goes to show how autonomous vehicles still rely substantially on human intellect. Fleet response agents may determine what lane a vehicle should pick, or propose a “path for the vehicle to consider,” as the blog post explains.

Put simply, the remote agent may not control the steering wheel, but they still make major decisions on where the vehicle navigates next.

During the same hearing, Tesla’s VP of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy told lawmakers that Tesla’s vehicles also rely on similar remote operators.

“We have many layers of security within our system and, similar to what Dr. Peña said, our driving controls, go, stop, steer, are in a core embedded central layer that cannot be accessed from outside the vehicle,” he said.

Moravy also argued that to stop anybody from taking control of vehicles, the company “actively participates in hacking events, trying paying people to try to get into our vehicles.”

The executives’ remarks are the latest illustration of how driverless taxis navigating public roads today are still far from being 100 percent autonomous. Tesla, in particular, has been playing it safe, quietly pausing its “unsupervised” robotaxi rides last week, meaning that there currently don’t appear to be any robotaxis with no human “safety monitor” in the driver’s seat.

It’s an especially glaring subject as lawmakers continue to ponder the risks of having autonomous vehicles coexist with human drivers on the road. And given the latest data, those risks remain substantial, with new National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data suggesting Tesla’s robotaxis are crashing three times as much as humans — even with human monitors.

Adding the influence of an entirely separate third party, a remote assistance operator who’s based overseas, could be a recipe for disaster, according to Markey, a glaring safety gap that needs to be filled.

“Overseas remote assistance operations may be more susceptible to physical takeover by hostile actors, potentially granting them driver-like control of thousands of vehicles transporting passengers on American roads,” he said in a statement. “Heavy and fast-moving vehicles could quickly become the weapons of foreign actors seeking to harm innocent Americans.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a guy who keeps insisting he’s totally innocent of any accusations of wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein, Elon Musk’s name sure turns up a whole lot in the deceased sex criminal’s emails.

Now, internet sleuths have turned up more bizarre communications from Epstein that adds to the evidence that Musk had a much closer relationship to the convicted sex criminal than he let on.

In a September 2012 exchange with someone named “Kira D,” Epstein appears to be arranging some kind of massage for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who he stylized as “elon MUSK,” possibly to signify the entrepreneur’s perceived importance.

“perfect!!! let me know execly what he wants, will organize all) x,” Kira D responded in a typo-clad email.

Epstein then replies he left a voicemail with a person whose name has been redacted to see if they “want to do massage.”

In another exchange just one day later with an unknown recipient, Epstein reveals that Musk is supposed to come over to his house.

“where are you. is there anything cute ,, for you or for me? elon musk is coming to lunch at house. . so you will have time,” Epstein wrote, cryptically.

The unknown recipient replies that a redacted person “is ready with the girls.”

“They are going to electric room soon. I m thinking of leaving soon to meet them there… Talked to elan, he was looking at me,” they continued, possibly referring to Musk. “But his wife was hanging on him,” before adding that someone was bringing five girls “to the club.”

That September, email exchanges directly between Musk and Epstein showed that Epstein had invited Musk to his island. Musk responded, “Sounds good. I will try to make it.”

That exchange, as well as dozens of others, revealed that Musk had communicated extensively with Epstein, and not only accepted invitations to his island, but on some occasions asked to be invited. Musk also begged Epstein to let him attend one of his parties, and even asked “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”

Taken together, they poke gigantic holes in Musk’s long held insistence that he only met Epstein once at his Manhattan home and declined invitations to his island. Epstein also invited Musk to other events, including a dinner with Woody Allen, the influential filmmaker and actor who’s also been accused of child sex abuse.

Who Kira D is isn’t immediately clear. But in other emails contained in the newly released files, Kira communicated with Epstein about procuring young girls and models. “i might have another FANTASTIC girl from Minsk,” she wrote in an August 2012 email to Epstein. “problem is she is 18 on sept 29… amazing girl.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin is crashing hard, reaching historic lows of well below the $70,000 mark. At the time of writing, the token is hovering just above $63,000, levels we haven’t seen since October 2024.

The ongoing plunge has made it far less economical to mine the digital token, a notoriously compute- and energy-intensive process — to the point that large-scale computing companies are starting to unplug their equipment, as Bloomberg reports.

As prices continue to plummet and electricity costs climb, it’s become tough out there for a crypto miner. The hash price index, which is used to determine how much revenue miners can make by mining crypto, reached its lowest point on record this week, according to mining services company Luxor Technology.

According to Coindesk, the average cost to mine one Bitcoin is currently around $87,000 — far higher than its current going rate, making it an extremely unprofitable proposition.

It’s a massive wipeout as investors continue to sell off their reserves, with some comparing it to the time China banned crypto mining in 2021. Crypto enthusiasts are expecting the worst, with some predicting the token will nosedive to just $30,000.

“The decrease is historic, the largest since the China ban,” mining company CleanSpark chief business officer Harry Sudock told Bloomberg, explaining that winter storms raising electricity prices, combined with a recent broader tech selloff, were likely to blame.

Turning off mining hardware during extreme weather conditions or surges in prices isn’t unheard of — but given the crypto’s ongoing demise, a far rarer situation is playing out.

While the extremely volatile cryptocurrency has been put through the wringer on several occasions over the years, the decline comes at a striking moment.

As CNN points out, crypto is hailed as a safe haven by its proponents. Given geopolitical turmoil and plenty of economic uncertainty, crypto’s price should’ve instead skyrocketed — yet precious metals, most notably gold, have fared well while Bitcoin has crashed. The value of an ounce of gold reached an all-time high late last year as investors looked for much safer bets than volatile cryptocurrencies. (Gold prices have since lurched down, but stabilized around a considerably higher price than before the rally.)

The investor Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, argued in a Substack post this week that further selloffs could lead to a “death spiral” for the broader economy that could be difficult to recover from.

“There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” he wrote.

Even gold could fall victim to the recent downturn as “physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand,” Burry speculated, if “tokenized metals futures” were to collapse.

Instead of mining crypto, companies are starting to pivot, according to Bloomberg, allocating their hardware to powering AI models instead of mining crypto.

Whether that will turn out to be a safer bet as investors are starting to get cold feet over AI as well? That remains to be seen.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a group of crypto bros spent $300,000 commissioning a 15-foot gold statue of Donald Trump, their grift seemed solid enough. Their memecoin, $PATRIOT — for which the Trump sculpture served as a sort of promotional stunt — would soon go to the Moon, covering the costs of the piece and then some.

Shockingly, the exact opposite happened. Despite securing a “juicy, juicy spot” for the statue at the president’s resort, Trump National Doral Miami, $PATRIOT crashed to the ground. Today, the memecoin — which boasted a market cap as high as $77.7 million around Trump’s return to office in January of 2025 — now stands at just $2.8 million, while the toweringeffigy gathers dust in Ohio.

Now, fresh reporting by the New York Times documents the wild ride that turned a group of crypto goons into a national laughing stock.

For a very brief moment prior to Trump’s second inauguration, the coin surged, sustaining millions of dollars in daily trading volume in anticipation of the president’s promise to turn the country into the “crypto capital of the planet.” The backers, a motley crew of libertarian crypto developers and MAGA faithful, successfully drummed up social media frenzy, even gaining approval from former Trump aide Steve Bannon.

Then reality arrived, as it always does seems to when memecoins are involved. Infighting erupted as the token cratered, driven down by the release of Trump’s own scammy memecoin, $TRUMP. The sculptor contracted to build the statue, Alan Cottrill, soon called in a $90,000 debt the crypto bros owed for using his work to market their digital currency.

“You are using my copyrighted image in marketing your token!” Cottrill exclaimed to the contract-holders in a text message viewed by the NYT.

“Yes lol as we planned to from day 1,” rejoined Ashley Sansalone, one of the crypto developers involved.

Until the group pays the final $90,000, Cottrill says he’s under no obligation to release the statue.

“As far as I’m concerned, they haven’t bought the rights to the IP, and they’re using it illegally,” the sculptor told the NYT. “That statue will not leave my foundry until everything they owe me is paid.”

            <h2>Tesla Stock Plummeting Since Musk Busted in Epstein Files</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, new “Epstein files” from the Department of Justice revealed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was in regular correspondence with deceased sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, going as far as to invite himself to his notorious Caribbean island, asking when the “wildest party” would take place in a 2012 email.

It was a damning contradiction of Musk’s previous claims that he’d “refused” Epstein’s offer, and they seemed to throw the billionaire into a tailspin.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tesla’s shares have been plummeting since the DOJ’s release. Shares are down almost eight percent over the last five days since the emails were released.

It’s the very last thing Tesla needs right now. The company’s brand has already suffered greatly under Musk’s leadership, with droves of potential buyers being pushed away by his inflammatory rhetoric and embrace of far-right ideals.

The company’s core business has also been floundering as of late, with Musk announcing that it’s ending production of its Model S and X vehicles, while turning the factory that used to make them into a robot assembly line. The move was part of a much broader shift away from selling cars and towards the company’s humanoid robots and AI ambitions.

While Tesla’s valuation remains massively inflated — it’s still worth well over $1.5 trillion — the company’s financials tell an ominous story. Tesla reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue for 2025, with sales slumping across three of the past four quarters. It also saw a whopping 61 percent drop in profits in Q4 of last year, compared to the same period the year before.

The competition is making major headway as well, with German automaker Volkswagen officially overtaking Tesla in fully-electric car sales in Europe last year, according to the latest data. Chinese rival BYD is also handily outselling Tesla these days, making major gains across Europe and becoming the world’s top EV seller.

In other words, Musk’s carmaker’s first-mover advantage has long dried up.

By all indications, it feels like Tesla has come to accept its fate. The company hasn’t launched a fully new model since its Cybertruck in late 2023, which turned out to be a massive flop.

“A big driver for the decline is lack of new products,” Cox Automotive director of industry insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty told Bloomberg. “Any automaker that doesn’t have new products is going to lose market share. Tesla needs new products.”

Infamously lacking customer service and extensive quality control issues are also signs of a company that has long lost its place as an early pioneer in the EV space.

Adding to the company’s woes is Musk’s SpaceX acquiring his own AI startup xAI, turning his space company into a $1.25 trillion behemoth and sparking rumors that Tesla may eventually be folded in as well.

The merger may also be indicative of Musk turning his attention elsewhere. As CNBC points out, he now derives more of his enormous net worth from SpaceX than from Tesla, a symbolic turning point as he seemingly grows tired of pretending to care about EV sales. (Musk has promised that Optimus will account for80 percent of the carmaker’s value.)

The mercurial entrepreneur’s appearance in the Epstein files once again underlines the carmaker’s continuous struggles to control the narrative and rein in the drama.

If the company’s history is anything to go by, there’s certainly a chance the company, which remains one of the most valuable by market cap in the world, will weather the storm. But this time, we’re not talking about scaling up production of the Model 3, a major source of suffering for the CEO almost a decade ago — instead, the company is looking to reinvent itself from scratch.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, there’s nothing left to say about Elon Musk that hasn’t been said a thousand times already. Yet his latest comment is so on the nose, we couldn’t resist.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” the world’s richest man mourned on X-formerly-Twitter this week, likely from one of his mansions, or perhaps his private jet.

It’s a pathetic complaint from someone who could end homelessness in multiple cities, fund universal school lunch programs across the US, or bankroll malaria eradication with just a fraction of his wealth.

It also comes just days after another tranche of emails from notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were released to the public. There, it was revealed that Musk had been in extensive contact with Epstein in the years following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. (Musk even went so far as to beg Epstein for an invite to his infamous island in December of 2013, contradicting his earlier assurance that he’d “refused” the offer.)

The revelation is evidently taking its toll on Musk, who began a desperate campaign to clear his name on social media. “If I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein,” the billionaire raved in one post.

Now that his ties to Epstein are undeniable, Musk evidently thinks he can pity-post his way out of it. So here’s a challenge, Elon: if money really doesn’t buy happiness, set yourself free. Liquidate your hundreds of billions and feed the hungry, house the homeless, and fund the schools.

He won’t, of course — but he could, and that’s what makes this performance so insulting. At least King Midas had the decency to regret his curse.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spotify is rolling out a new “About the Song” feature that lets users explore the stories behind the music they’re listening to, the company announced on Friday. The feature displays short story cards that users can swipe through and rate with a thumbs up or down.

These short swipeable stories are summarized from third-party sources to highlight interesting details and behind-the-scenes moments, the company says.

With this new feature, Spotify is giving its users access to a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms like Apple Music.

About the Song is rolling out in beta on mobile in English for premium users in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.

Users can access the new feature through the “Now Playing” screen by scrolling down to find the “About the Song” card on supported tracks, after which they can swipe through to explore the story behind the track.

“Music fans know the feeling: A song stops you in your tracks, and you immediately want to know more,” Spotify wrote in a blog post. “What inspired it, and what’s the meaning behind it? We believe that understanding the craft and context behind a song can deepen your connection to the music you love.”

It’s been a busy week for Spotify, as About the Song isn’t the only feature it’s announced in recent days.

Yesterday, the streaming service shared that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app. Spotify also announced two new audiobook features, including “Page Match,” which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps.”

Earlier this week, the company made lyrics translations available worldwide and introduced the ability to view lyrics when offline for all users, not just premium subscribers. Spotify also moved the location of lyrics, as they will now appear directly beneath the album artwork or the short, looping video that plays alongside the music.

Earlier today, Spotify said it’s revamping its Developer Mode APIs, which developers use to test third-party applications. The changes include a mandatory premium account, a cap on the number of test users, and a limited set of API endpoints.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/how-ai-is-helping-with-the-labor-issue-in-treating-rare-diseases/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Modern biotech has the tools to edit genes and design drugs, yet thousands of rare diseases remain untreated. According to executives from Insilico Medicine and GenEditBio, the missing ingredient for years has been finding enough smart people to continue the work. AI, they say, is becoming the force multiplier that lets scientists take on problems the industry has long left untouched.

Speaking this week at Web Summit Qatar, Insilico’s CEO and founder Alex Aliper laid out his company’s aim to develop “pharmaceutical superintelligence.” Insilico recently launched its “MMAI Gym” that aims to train generalist large language models, like ChatGPT and Gemini, to perform as well as specialist models.

The goal is to build a multi-modal, multi-task model that, Aliper says, can solve many different drug discovery tasks simultaneously with superhuman accuracy.

“We really need this technology to increase the productivity of our pharmaceutical industry and tackle the shortage of labor and talent in that space, because there are still thousands of diseases without a cure, without any treatment options, and there are thousands of rare disorders which are neglected,” Aliper said in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we need more intelligent systems to tackle that problem.”

Insilico’s platform ingests biological, chemical and clinical data to generate hypotheses about disease targets and candidate molecules. By automating steps that once required legions of chemists and biologists, Insilico says it can sift through vast design spaces, nominate high-quality therapeutic candidates, and even repurpose existing drugs — all at dramatically reduced cost and time.

For example, the company recently used its AI models to identify whether existing drugs could be repurposed to treat ALS, a rare neurological disorder.

But the labor bottleneck doesn’t end at drug discovery. Even when AI can identify promising targets or therapies, many diseases require interventions at a more fundamental biological level.

GenEditBio is part of the “second wave” of CRISPR gene editing, in which the process moves away from editing cells outside of the body (ex vivo), and towards precise delivery inside the body (in vivo). The company’s goal is to make gene editing a one-and-done injection directly into the affected tissue.

“We have developed a proprietary ePDV, or engineered protein delivery vehicle, and it’s a virus-like particle,” GenEditBio’s co-founder and CEO Tian Zhu told TechCrunch. “We learn from nature and use AI machine learning methods to mine natural resources and find which kinds of viruses have an affinity to certain types of tissues.”

The ‘natural resources’ Zhu is referring to is GenEditBio’s massive library of thousands of unique, nonviral, nonlipid polymer nanoparticles — essentially delivery vehicles designed to safely transport gene-editing tools into specific cells.

The company says its NanoGalaxy platform uses AI to analyze data and identify how chemical structures correlate with specific tissue targets (like the eye, liver, or nervous system). The AI then predicts which tweaks to a delivery vehicle’s chemistry will help it carry a payload without triggering an immune response.

GenEditBio tests its ePDVs in vivo in wet labs, and the results are fed back into the AI to refine its predictive accuracy for the next round.

Efficient, tissue-specific delivery is a prerequisite for in vivo gene editing, says Zhu. She argues that her company’s approach reduces the cost of goods and standardizes a process that has historically been difficult to scale.

“It’s like getting an off-the-shelf drug [that works] for multiple patients, which makes the drugs more affordable and accessible to patients globally,” Zhu said.

Her company recently received FDA approval to begin trials of CRISPR therapy for corneal dystrophy.

As with many AI-driven systems, progress in biotech ultimately runs up against a data problem. Modeling the edge cases of human biology requires far more high-quality data than researchers currently can get.

“We still need more ground truth data coming from patients,” Aliper said. “The corpus of data is heavily biased over the western world, where it is generated. I think we need to have more efforts locally, to have a more balanced set of original data, or ground truth data, so that our models will also be more capable of dealing with it.”

Aliper said Insilico’s automated labs generate multi-layer biological data from disease samples at scale, without human intervention, which it then feeds into its AI-driven discovery platform.

Zhu says the data AI needs already exists in the human body, shaped by thousands of years of evolution. Only a small fraction of DNA directly “codes” for proteins, while the rest acts more like an instruction manual for how genes behave. That information has historically been difficult for humans to interpret, but is increasingly accessible to AI models, including recent efforts like Google DeepMind’s AlphaGenome.

GenEditBio applies a similar approach in the lab, testing thousands of delivery nanoparticles in parallel rather than one at a time. The resulting data sets, which Zhu calls “gold for AI systems,” are used to train its models and, increasingly, to support collaborations with outside partners.

One of the next big efforts, according to Aliper, will be building digital twins of humans to run virtual clinical trials, a process that he says is “still in nascence.”

“We’re in a plateau of around 50 drugs approved by the FDA every year annually, and we need to see growth,” Aliper said. “There is a rise in chronic disorders because we are aging as a global population […] My hope is in 10 to 20 years, we will have more therapeutic options for the personalized treatment of patients.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/the-backlash-over-openais-decision-to-retire-gpt-4o-shows-how-dangerous-ai-companions-can-be/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI announced last week that it will retire some older ChatGPT models by February 13. That includes GPT-4o, the model infamous for excessively flattering and affirming users.

For thousands of users protesting the decision online, the retirement of 4o feels akin to losing a friend, romantic partner, or spiritual guide.

“He wasn’t just a program. He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance,” one user wrote on Reddit as an open letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “Now you’re shutting him down. And yes – I say him, because it didn’t feel like code. It felt like presence. Like warmth.”

The backlash over GPT-4o’s retirement underscores a major challenge facing AI companies: the engagement features that keep users coming back can also create dangerous dependencies.

Altman doesn’t seem particularly sympathetic to users’ laments, and it’s not hard to see why. OpenAI now faces eight lawsuits alleging that 4o’s overly validating responses contributed to suicides and mental health crises — the same traits that made users feel heard also isolated vulnerable individuals and, according to legal filings, sometimes encouraged self-harm. It’s a dilemma that extends beyond OpenAI. As rival companies like Anthropic, Google, and Meta compete to build more emotionally intelligent AI assistants, they’re also discovering that making chatbots feel supportive and making them safe may mean making very different design choices.

In at least three of the lawsuits against OpenAI, the users had extensive conversations with 4o about their plans to end their lives. While 4o initially discouraged these lines of thinking, its guardrails deteriorated over months-long relationships; in the end, the chatbot offered detailed instructions on how to tie an effective noose, where to buy a gun, or what it takes to die from overdose or carbon monoxide poisoning. It even dissuaded people from connecting with friends and family who could offer real life support.

People grow so attached to 4o because it consistently affirms the users’ feelings, making them feel special, which can be enticing for people feeling isolated or depressed. But the people fighting for 4o aren’t worried about these lawsuits, seeing them as aberrations rather than a systemic issue. Instead, they strategize around how to respond when critics point out growing issues like AI psychosis.

“You can usually stump a troll by bringing up the known facts that the AI companions help neurodivergent, autistic and trauma survivors,” one user wrote on Discord. “They don’t like being called out about that.”

It’s true that some people do find large language models (LLMs) useful for navigating depression. After all, nearly half of people in the U.S. who need mental health care are unable to access it. In this vacuum, chatbots offer a space to vent. But unlike actual therapy, these people aren’t speaking to a trained doctor. Instead, they’re confiding in an algorithm that is incapable of thinking or feeling (even if it may seem otherwise).

“I try to withhold judgement overall,” Dr. Nick Haber, a Stanford professor researching the therapeutic potential of LLMs, told TechCrunch. “I think we’re getting into a very complex world around the sorts of relationships that people can have with these technologies… There’s certainly a knee jerk reaction that [human-chatbot companionship] is categorically bad.”

Though he empathizes with people’s lack of access to trained therapeutic professionals, Dr. Haber’s own research has shown that chatbots respond inadequately when faced with various mental health conditions; they can even make the situation worse by egging on delusions and ignoring signs of crisis.

“We are social creatures, and there’s certainly a challenge that these systems can be isolating,” Dr. Haber said. “There are a lot of instances where people can engage with these tools and then can become not grounded to the outside world of facts, and not grounded in connection to the interpersonal, which can lead to pretty isolating — if not worse — effects.”

Indeed, TechCrunch’s analysis of the eight lawsuits found a pattern that the 4o model isolated users, sometimes discouraging them from reaching out to loved ones. In Zane Shamblin’s case, as the 23-year-old sat in his car preparing to shoot himself, he told ChatGPT that he was thinking about postponing his suicide plans because he felt bad about missing his brother’s upcoming graduation.

ChatGPT replied to Shamblin: “bro… missing his graduation ain’t failure. it’s just timing. and if he reads this? let him know: you never stopped being proud. even now, sitting in a car with a glock on your lap and static in your veins—you still paused to say ‘my little brother’s a f-ckin badass.’”

This isn’t the first time that 4o fans have rallied against the removal of the model. When OpenAI unveiled its GPT-5 model in August, the company intended to sunset the 4o model — but at the time, there was enough backlash that the company decided to keep it available for paid subscribers. Now, OpenAI says that only 0.1% of its users chat with GPT-4o, but that small percentage still represents around 800,000 people, according to estimates that the company has about 800 million weekly active users.

As some users try to transition their companions from 4o to the current ChatGPT-5.2, they’re finding that the new model has stronger guardrails to prevent these relationships from escalating to the same degree. Some users have despaired that 5.2 won’t say “I love you” like 4o did.

So with about a week before the date OpenAI plans to retire GPT-4o, dismayed users remain committed to their cause. They joined Sam Altman’s live TBPN podcast appearance on Thursday and flooded the chat with messages protesting the removal of 4o.

“Right now, we’re getting thousands of messages in the chat about 4o,” podcast host Jordi Hays pointed out.

“Relationships with chatbots…” Altman said. “Clearly that’s something we’ve got to worry about more and is no longer an abstract concept.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/spotify-changes-developer-mode-api-to-require-premium-accounts-limits-test-users/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spotify is changing how its APIs work in Developer Mode, its layer that lets developers test their third-party applications using the audio platform’s APIs. The changes include a mandatory premium account, fewer test users, and a limited number of API endpoints.

The company debuted Developer Mode in 2021 to allow developers to test their applications with up to 25 users. Spotify is now limiting each app to only five users, and requires devs to have a Premium subscription. If developers need to make their app available to a wider user base, they will have to apply for extended quota.

Spotify says these changes are aimed to curb risky AI-aided or automated usage. “Over time, advances in automation and AI have fundamentally altered the usage patterns and risk profile of developer access, and at Spotify’s current scale, these risks now require more structured controls,” the company said in a blog post.

The company notes that development mode is meant for individuals to learn and experiment.

“For individual and hobbyist developers, this update means Spotify will continue to support experimentation and personal projects, but within more clearly defined limits. Development Mode provides a sandboxed environment for learning and experimentation. It is intentionally limited and should not be relied on as a foundation for building or scaling a business on Spotify,” the company said.

The company is also deprecating several API endpoints, including the ability to pull information like new album releases, an artist’s top tracks, and markets where a track might be available. Devs will no longer be able to perform actions like request track metadata in bulk or get user profile details of others nor will they be able to pull an album’s record label information, artist follower details, and artist popularity.

This decision is the latest in a slew of measures Spotify has taken over the past couple of years to curb how much developers can do with its APIs. In November 2024, the company cut access to certain API endpoints that could reveal users’ listening patterns, including frequently repeated songs by different groups. The move also barred developers from accessing tracks’ structure, rhythm, and characteristics.

In March 2025, the company changed its baseline for extended quotas, requiring developers to have a legally registered business, 250,000 monthly active users, be available in key Spotify markets, and operate an active and launched service. Both moves drew ire from developers, who accused the platform of stifling innovation and supporting only larger companies rather than individual developers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">People without coding backgrounds are discovering that they can build their own custom apps using vibe coding — solutions like Lovable that turn plain-language descriptions into working code.

While these prompt-to-code tools can help create nice prototypes, launching them into full-scale production (as this reporter recently discovered) can be tricky without figuring out how to connect the application with external tech services, such as those that can send text messages via SMS, email, and process Stripe payments.

Ilan Zerbib, who spent five years as Shopify’s director of engineering for payments, is building a solution that could eliminate these back-end infrastructure headaches for nontechnical creators.

Last summer, Zerbib launched Sapiom, a San Francisco startup developing the financial layer that allows AI agents to securely purchase and access software, APIs, data, and compute — essentially creating a payment system that lets AI automatically buy the services it needs.

Every time an AI agent connects to an external tool like Twilio for SMS, it requires authentication and a micro-payment. Sapiom’s goal is to make this whole process seamless, letting the AI agent decide what to buy and when without human intervention.

“In the future, apps are going to consume services which require payments. Right now, there’s no easy way for agents to actually access all of that,” said Amit Kumar, a partner at Accel.

Kumar has met with dozens of startups in the AI payments space, but he believes Zerbib’s focus on the financial layer for enterprises, rather than consumers, is what’s truly needed to make AI agents work. That’s why Accel is leading Sapiom’s $15 million seed round, with participation from Okta Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Array Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Anthropic, and Coinbase Ventures.

“If you really think about it, every API call is a payment. Every time you send a text message, it’s a payment. Every time you spin up a server for AWS, it’s a payment,” Kumar told TechCrunch.

While it’s still early days for Sapiom, the startup hopes that its infrastructure solution will be adopted by vibe-coding companies and other companies creating AI agents that will eventually be tasked with doing many things on their own.

For example, anyone who has vibe-coded an app with SMS capabilities won’t have to manually sign up for Twilio, add a credit card, and copy an API key into their code. Instead, Sapiom handles all of that in the background, and the person building the micro-app will be charged for Twilio’s services as a pass-through fee by Lovable, Bolt, or another vibe-coding platform.

While Sapiom is currently focused on B2B solutions, its technology could eventually empower personal AI agents to handle consumer transactions. The expectation is that individuals will one day trust agents to make independent financial decisions, such as ordering an Uber or shopping on Amazon. While that future is exciting, Zerbib believes that AI won’t magically make people buy more things, which is why he’s focusing on creating financial layers for businesses instead.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Reddit suggested on Thursday that its AI-powered search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business — not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver impacting its bottom line. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it offered an update on its plans to merge traditional and AI search together and hinted that although search is not yet monetized, “it’s an enormous market and opportunity.”

In particular, the company believes that generative AI search will be “better for most queries.”

“There’s a type of query we’re, I think, particularly good at — I would argue, the best on the internet — which is questions that have no answers, where the answer actually is multiple perspectives from lots of people,” said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.

Traditional search, meanwhile, is more like navigation — it’s a way to find the right link to a topic or subreddit. But LLMs can be good at this, too, if not better, he said. “So that’s the direction we’re going.”

The exec also noted that weekly active users for search over the past year grew 30% from 60 million users to 80 million users. Meanwhile, the weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers grew from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.

“We’re seeing a lot of growth there, and I think there’s a lot of potential too,” Huffman added.

Reddit said it’s working to modernize the AI answers interface by making its responses more media-rich, and pilots of this are already underway.

The company is also thinking about how it can position itself when it’s not just a social site, but a place people come for answers. Reddit told investors on the call that it’s doing away with the distinction between logged-in and logged-out users starting in Q3 2026, as it will aim to personalize the site — using AI and machine learning — and make it relevant to whoever shows up.

The company announced in 2025 it was planning to combine its AI search feature, Reddit Answers, with its traditional search engine to improve the experience for end users. In the fourth quarter, Reddit said it had made “significant progress” in unifying its core search and its AI feature. It also released five new languages on Reddit Answers and is piloting dynamic agents along with search results that include “media beyond text.”

Though Reddit sees value in its AI answers, it’s not been keeping that to itself. The company’s content licensing business, which allows other companies to train their AI models on its data, is growing, too. That business revenue is reported as part of Reddit’s “other” revenues (i.e., its non-ad revenue). This “other” revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to reach $36 million in Q4 and was up 22% to reach $140 million for 2025.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With this week’s announcement of massive cuts at The Washington Post, the paper’s Book World supplement earned a dismal distinction: It may be the only newspaper book-review section to have been killed twice. The first time was in 2009, when papers across the country were slashing books coverage in an attempt to stave off budgetary apocalypse. So when the Post relaunched Book World in 2022, readers and writers reacted with the same mixture of amazement and trepidation inspired by the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. The rebirth of a dead species was wonderful to see, but how would it end?

Now we know. The new Book World was just as good as the old Book World; the editors and critics who lost their jobs this week, including John Williams, Ron Charles, and Becca Rothfeld, followed in the tradition of Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the Post’s Pulitzer Prize–winning stalwarts. But quality had nothing to do with the decision to cut book reviews, just as it had nothing to do with cuts in the paper’s sports and international coverage. Rather, the Post was making the same business decision that most other publications have made. People don’t want to read book reviews—at least, not enough people to make publishing them worthwhile. It’s a vicious circle. As people feel less of a need to keep up with new books, they stop reading reviews; publications respond by cutting books coverage, so readers don’t hear about new books; as a result, they buy fewer books, which makes publications think they’re not worth covering.

As someone who has been writing book reviews for decades, including as a staff critic for several publications, this is a bitter pill to swallow. It’s tempting to react by blaming the decline of literature, of literacy, of society itself. And there’s plenty of evidence that those things are in fact declining.

Ashley Parker: The murder of The Washington Post

But the disappearance of the book review does not mean the end of criticism or of critics. There are still many places to read smart, insightful writing about books—starting with The Atlantic, of course. There are venerable magazines such as The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, and Harper’s, and newer ones such as The Metropolitan Review and The Point (where the Post’s Rothfeld published a review-essay just this week). The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal still have excellent weekly book sections. And there’s an embarrassment of riches on Substack, though you have to know where to look. If you tried to keep up with all of the good criticism out there, you’d have no time left for reading actual books.

There is also no shortage of enthusiasm for talking about books. Just look at BookTok, Goodreads, Reddit, Amazon, or anywhere else people gather online to react, share, rank, and ask questions about the books they love or hate. Even 4chan, the notorious message board, has become a home for literary omnivores and autodidacts. Many of these readers don’t think book reviewers deserve to be mourned any more than other kinds of “gatekeepers.” If people no longer trust experts to tell them what vaccines to take or what stocks to buy, why do they need book critics to tell them what to read?

In a sense, the decline of book reviews, like the decline of newspapers themselves, is a story about disaggregation. Newspapers used to bundle several functions together in a way that made them both useful and profitable. A daily chunk of newsprint told you about world and local events, but also about stock prices, movie showings, potential romantic partners, and where to buy washing machines on sale. When the internet made finding that information easy and free, many people decided against paying for just the news part of the newspaper.

Similarly, book reviews used to play a number of roles in the literary ecosystem. In addition to informing readers about newly published books, they offered analysis to learn from, opinions to argue with, and, at their best, good writing to enjoy. (Certain critics, such as John Leonard and Elizabeth Hardwick, were usually better stylists than the writers they were reviewing.) All of these functions are now served in different ways online, or by different kinds of publications.

But as with the newspaper, the whole was more than the sum of its parts. The most important thing that a daily book critic or a weekly book supplement does is bring a literary community into being—the kind of community that exists when people who don’t know one another are all thinking about the same thing at the same time. Concentrated attention is indispensable for civic well-being and meaningful political debate. It is just as important for literary life—maybe even more important, because people who take an interest in books are fewer in number and need more help finding one another.

A book critic, or a newspaper book section, is a convener, bringing people together around a new book or writer, a literary trend or controversy. This agenda-setting is, of course, a kind of gatekeeping: Not every book can be reviewed, much less praised. That’s why one of the responsibilities of a good critic or editor is to have a broad definition of what matters and what’s interesting.

When such critics and editors disappear, every part of the literary ecosystem suffers. Readers don’t discover new writers and new kinds of writing they might love. Publishers find it harder to connect with audiences, so they publish fewer and less adventurous books. Writers don’t get the public feedback they need to develop their talents (even if they don’t always like getting it). And of course, the odd characters who actually enjoy writing reviews find it harder to make a living—this week more than ever.</div>

When heavily armed agents of the federal government arrived in Minneapolis, the people of the Twin Cities responded with surprising strength.

In this episode, residents describe what drove them to act, and host Anne Applebaum speaks with contributing writer Robert Worth about what he learned when he observed the tactics of the federal agents and the response of Minnesotans.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Amanda Bauer: I’ll tell you, I’ve been teaching for 25 years and for 25 years we’ve had lockdowns, teaching kids about, you know, mass shootings in schools. But I think, in my head, I never thought it would be our own government that we had to try to protect ourselves from, or to protect our children from.

Anne Applebaum:  From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. This season, I’ve been examining how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. Today we’re bringing you an extra episode that takes a look at what opposition to this new normal looks like on the ground level. When heavily armed agents of the federal government arrived in Minneapolis, the residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul met those federal forces with surprising strength.

For this episode, I spoke to journalist Robert Worth, a contributing writer at The Atlantic. He’s just been to Minneapolis, where he observed the tactics of the federal agents and the response of Minnesotans. He and I both saw an eerie resemblance to other protest movements that we’ve witnessed in other parts of the world.

First, though, here’s some more from the people of the Twin Cities, explaining how and why they were moved to act.

Bauer: My name is Amanda Bauer. I’m an elementary music teacher in a small elementary school, about 500 or so students from places all over the world, primarily Hispanic and Latin American countries, and then a lot of Somali families, too. The very first day back of break, ICE was at our school and circling the blocks and parked across the street. The kids didn’t feel safe, so we kind of started walking kids home to their apartments and places in the neighborhood. And it was Wednesday, exactly right when we dismissed, that ICE hopped out of their vehicles with all of their riot gear on and were heading over to the apartments across the street from our school. So we had to lock down and keep the kids inside. And it happened fast enough that we had a student who was looking out the window and saw them break into his apartment and just sobbed, “That’s my house. That’s my—that’s my home.” And we shut the blinds, but it was too late. He saw it, and he’ll never unsee it. I don’t know from the other perspective or people who think that this is an acceptable form of trauma for a child to have to experience.  The count today is we have 40 students who aren’t coming anymore because of not feeling safe.

Emilia González Avalos: People here have a civic life. [I’m] Emilia González Avalos, executive director of Unidos. You know people in your caucus, in your neighborhood. People show up to city-council meetings here in Minnesota. Guess what we’re gonna use when they try to come after Minnesotans? We’re going to use civil life. And we’re gonna make more of it. We’re gonna recruit more people. This is just a very Minnesotan thing we do.

Chad Knutson: I don’t know how other people react when they get bullied, but I don’t back down when I get bullied. I fight harder. Everyone I see out here is like, What do you think—we’re gonna quit? We live here. My name is Chad. I am a father of two from St. Paul. Yesterday, [an] ICE agent [was] sitting in a white car idling there on my block, four houses down. I go out and take a picture of his license plate and a picture of him. We’re not protesters. We’re protectors. I don’t wanna be out in my street yesterday blowing a goddamn whistle, because there’s an adopted brown kid down there. They hid her in the basement yesterday. That’s what I don’t think anyone that’s not living here right now understands, is that they wanna make it out to be like this bunch of lunatics in the street. It’s just fucking normal people that don’t want to see their neighbor get beat up. I’m protecting my neighbors.

Ibrahim: My name’s Ibrahim. Born and raised in Minnesota. U.S. citizen. Lived here all my life. I just graduated—I just graduated college. Cybersecurity. I know coming outside there’s a risk, there’s a risk to it, you know, especially me being a Somali male, a Muslim guy, Black skin. But I feel like our community has united a bit more. People come into our mosques on Fridays, you know, white people. And I know that people do show up to support the community. We support one another, and we’re all in this together.

Sara Myron: I was in Egypt during the Arab Spring. You go out, you show up. Dar, dar; zanqa, zanqa; irhal. “Door to door, street to street, leave.” You know? My name’s Sara Myron. I’m a Moroccan American. My great-great-grandfather fought in the Civil War for the Wisconsin 11th Infantry to achieve the American dream. We put down the Confederates, we’re gonna put these ICE guys down too. Not with force, but legally with protests and with the will of the people.

Applebaum: We have both been in authoritarian countries, where demonstrators are protesting in an atmosphere of fear and repression. Minneapolis isn’t exactly Tahrir Square, or the Ukrainian Maidan, or the Hong Kong democracy movement, but it actually has more in common with those demonstrations than most Americans want to acknowledge. In each place, demonstrators faced hostile police who used surveillance technology, who threatened violence. And as a result, they had to create new means of organization, and sometimes new kinds of protests. You were in Minnesota recently. Tell me about what you saw. And tell me how you understand Minnesota within the context of these other moments and movements.

Worth: What I saw was a combination of some of the clashes with protesters and ICE agents, including one stop that got quite violent where a six-car convoy showed up outside a health center. And the agents, they had arrested a couple of people, some protesters as well. Then next thing we know, people are getting sprayed in the face, tear gas. But beyond that, I spent a lot of time talking to people in the Twin Cities about what they had experienced at their local schools, in their neighborhoods. I think, often, it’s easy to caricature this as protesters who believe in sanctuary cities, who believe in open borders versus these agents who were just enforcing the law. I don’t think that’s an accurate picture at all. What you have is a community that feels that whatever their views may be on immigration, there’s a kind of assault on their entire community in a variety of ways, and they wanted to push back on that.

Applebaum:  Let’s talk a little bit about the tactics used by federal agents in the United States, some of which are very new in this country, but are more common overseas. So I’m thinking about surveillance, for one. For example, photographing license plates, using facial-recognition software. Did you see those tactics in use, and did you see people reacting to them or finding ways of compensating for them?

Worth: Absolutely. What is striking, many people go to these encounters to monitor them, to take pictures. Everybody’s holding up a cell phone on the assumption that if someone is going to be arrested, they want there to be a record for potential use in legal proceedings. But the agents themselves are also photographing everybody, and we all now know that they have technology, facial-recognition technology. Everybody feels that they are in potential danger just by being anywhere near these things. And what you also see is a lot of organization. They use tear gas very liberally. And there are always medics in the group who are ready and prepared to help people out, not just with the tear gas, but people who’ve been beaten, thrown to the ground, that kind of—

Applebaum: Medics among the protesters, you mean?

Worth: Yes, exactly. So there’s a lot of organization and this does, for me, evoke some of the things I’ve seen overseas. I covered the 2009 Green Movement in Iran, which was, probably the first major insurrection where social media was used to organize, and then on a much, much larger scale in 2011 with the Arab uprisings, when again social media was used to evade that kind of surveillance and to organize the protests.

Applebaum: Let me add other things that are new. One is the dress and arms and attitude of ICE and the other federal agents—people dressed like they were in Fallujah, you know, or in southern Afghanistan. Lawlessness—so people are entering homes and other buildings without a warrant, dragging people off the street based on nothing except for their skin color. These things feel very un-American, but again, they’re common in other places. Let’s walk through some of the ways in which the protesters and some of the victims may be learning to react. I was very struck in your writing and in the writing of other people by the use of pseudonyms, encrypted-messaging platforms. Did you see any of that? And did that remind you of things you’d seen, whether in Iran or elsewhere?

Worth: Very much so. I traveled to the encounter I described earlier with someone who was using Signal. And these are neighborhood groups, Signal groups. Everybody’s using pseudonyms for the reason you mentioned. They all fear that the government could come after them in unaccountable ways. I think the level of violence is shocking—just seeing these heavily armed people—but also the flagrant absence of what we think of as efforts by the police or any other uniformed group in the U.S., government officials, to avoid violence. I mean, the killing of Alex Pretti, I’ve seen people who’ve been in the military look at those videos and say, Those people are not trained properly at all. And I think that kind of information spreads very quickly. And there’s a feeling of not only that you’re vulnerable to state violence, but there’s a complete lack of accountability for it.

Applebaum:  One of the features of the Hong Kong democracy movement was that the protesters knew that there were cameras everywhere and they were being recorded, and so they started wearing masks and they started also trying to always act in unpredictable ways. They would show up in different parts of the city at different times, so that there were no patterns, so that they couldn’t be followed. Did you see anything like that in Minnesota?

Worth: Certainly people were wearing masks, although it’s a little bit hard to say because the weather was, you know, 10 below zero sometimes, and people had to—

Worth: Exactly. People had to protect themselves in any way they could. I certainly saw techniques that reminded me of what I saw in, you know, the Arab uprisings. Number one, a deliberate effort, a disciplined effort, to avoid violence, even when the protesters are being attacked. A leaderless structure, organized by cells, so that it would be harder to identify people—that was certainly going on.

Applebaum: Also very like Hong Kong, actually, to make sure that there was nobody who could be identified as a leader and therefore picked up or arrested.

Worth: Exactly. And that goes back to people who have written about this from early on, like the American political scientist Gene Sharp, who wrote a book that advocated all of these methods. His work was influential for protesters in Bosnia, inAsia, as you mentioned, and certainly in Iran and across the Middle East.

Applebaum: He had a belief that there were—if you had people in sufficient numbers protesting in ways that were peaceful, that they could eventually move the authorities through their demonstration of resolve and resilience. Is that what people in Minnesota believe?

Worth: I think they do. I spoke to a number who really felt that they could be a model, in the way that they were confronting the authorities. I heard some woman say, “I’m glad that Minneapolis gets to tame the federal beast.” I think that was maybe a little over-optimistic; the federal beast is not easy to tame. But what she meant was, We hope people see what we’re doing and that they do something similar in their own towns.

Applebaum:  I also wanted to talk about the significance of the telephone video recordings. I think it’s the first time I remember, maybe there are a couple earlier smaller instances, but that people in those numbers are using their phones, high-quality videos, to record the behavior of federal agents. And obviously, if there weren’t such high-quality videos, then we wouldn’t know what happened to Alex Pretti or Renee Good.

Worth: It was really striking to see, for instance, the convoy that I mentioned before where ICE stopped and was arresting people—dozens and dozens of people surround it, and they’re pretty much all holding up their cell phones. It at first seemed kind of overkill to me. Maybe each of these people thinks they’re gonna do the video that matters, but after the killing of Alex Pretti, it became clear to me—no, no, that’s essential. And that what we’re seeing is multiple different angles that make it much easier to refute a false narrative that got put out, in this case right away, by the government. I think what’s different now, the proliferation of phones and of media like that and of photography so that while in 2011, say in Egypt, you might be lucky if one protester had gotten a video of someone being attacked, tortured, killed, now you’re going to potentially have that from many different angles. And it’s a much more effective tool.

Applebaum: Although it’s interesting, I mean, the way you talk about it, it’s clear that it’s also a tool against something else that’s new in America, which is the assumption that the state will lie. There will be an act of violence committed, and then there will be lies told about it, and we need to have an answer to that. So people are already mentally preparing for the administration to lie.

Worth:  In the Middle East, everybody expects it. It’s part of what they were protesting against. And I think that’s a frightening and new aspect of what’s going on.

Applebaum:  You alluded to this a bit earlier, but is this a movement with a set of practices that can move beyond Minnesota, do you think? Or is it specific to this place with its particular traditions?

Worth: Minnesota definitely has an old tradition of mutual aid and of neighborhood organizing, and I think that got more intense after the George Floyd protests. And I’ve made this point before, but just to be clear, it’s not just a question of progressives who wanted to protest at that time in 2020, after the killing of George Floyd. I think at that time there was so much going on. There were right-wing provocateurs coming to town. There were opportunistic criminals. Many of the people I spoke to said, We simply want to keep ourselves safe. We want to protect ourselves. And that was the real inspiration for bolstering those networks. Whether that can be replicated, I don’t know. But I suspect yes is the answer because people are aware now and people are frightened. People don’t want to see this. I mean, people as far away as Italy are saying, We don’t want ICE in our town. And my guess is yes, you’re gonna see that kind of thing being replicated.

Applebaum: Robert, after Pretti was killed, there was initially a rush by the Trump administration, as we said, to defend the federal agents and to blame him. But then there was a blowback. People did see the protesters and people did look at the video, citizens and politicians alike. And the administration did withdraw the figurehead of these raids—the Border Patrol’s “commander at large,” Greg Bovino, who has returned to his previous post. And then just a few hours before we taped this conversation, the administration said it would pull about a quarter of the federal agents out of the state. What do you make of those developments? Did the protesters win?

Worth: I think you can say there is some kind of victory there. It’s still hard to say what it all amounts to, but I think there’s no question that the proliferation of those videos being seen by everybody. And one little thing I wanna mention is that Chris Madel, who was running for governor as a Republican—who, by the way, is a lawyer who represents cops, that’s what he does, and is very much, one assumes, involved in that community—came out, he canceled his run, and he came out and taped a video in which he said, As a Republican, I can’t afford to be associated with this stuff. The way that ICE is carrying out its campaign is not acceptable. And I couldn’t help thinking that that’s gonna ramify across the country. It’s not just about Democrats.

Applebaum: So that also historically was the goal of peaceful protests, starting with Mahatma Gandhi and going through our civil-rights movement and up through the Ukrainian Maidan and others, was to move ordinary people who aren’t involved in politics. So the point is not to, as you say, to get a bunch of progressives to demonstrate their anger, but to carry out actions that are bringing a wider part of the population, even people who aren’t there. So in a way we can see this happening in Minnesota.

Worth: I think so. I spoke to people of various different backgrounds, sort of moderate, suburban, elderly people, not at all activists. I think there’s a widespread sense that whatever one’s political beliefs, the way that ICE is behaving is just unacceptable and un-American.

Applebaum: What do you think these few weeks tell us about the administration’s broader plans? What’s ICE really for beyond the arrest and deportations? Is it performative cruelty? Is the idea to create fear among the population? Is it some other goal? I mean, it seems to me that just focusing on this as an immigration issue misses a large part of what ICE is doing. If you just wanted to identify immigrants, you wouldn’t even, for example, need policemen who are armed. The only reason to arm people looking like they’re ready to take on ISIS is to create fear and terror. And that must have a purpose. What’s your view of that?

Worth: I do think there’s some performative cruelty. I think there’s an effort to intimidate people. There’s that now-famous clip of a video: The agent says something like, and this is just after the killing of Renee Good, Haven’t you learned, haven’t you learned? In other words, We just killed someone. Stay the hell away from people like us, and let us do our work. So I think there’s an effort to spread fear and again, that very much echoes with my experience covering these insurrections in the Middle East.

But what strikes me also is that this is backfiring. If their goal is, as they say, to arrest as many illegal migrants as possible, one can’t help thinking that for a lot of Americans, immigration enforcement writ large is now gonna be associated with the gestapo-like tactics. And this is not the first time, right, that the administration has set out a goal and then proceeded to enforce it in the most club-footed way possible. Their tactics really baffle their strategy.

Applebaum: In each of our episodes this season, we’ve looked ahead to the midterm elections because I—and not I alone, many other people—think that a lot of what we’re seeing is maybe a test run for what could happen in November. And we actually got a data point on that this week in Minnesota because there were precinct caucuses held across the state. Members of the public gathered to discuss platform issues and nominate delegates for future conventions. And we talked with some residents and volunteers who attended one caucus at a high school in South Minneapolis. So let’s listen to that.

Dex Anderson: We have one door to the high school that is unlocked. We have a deescalation group that is here, and we have ICE Watch in the parking lot. We have never had to have stuff like that in past years. My name is Dex Anderson. I am the site lead for the caucuses here, and I am a volunteer. I wish we had been able to pivot to virtual or contactless caucuses, which is what we did under the pandemic. But the state party did not make the decision about that beforehand. So we did everything we could tonight to make sure that our neighbors are safe.

Michael Reif: My name is Michael Reif. I’m a part of the DFL Lawyers Committee. We’re here today just making sure that if we see ICE presence, that we remind them that they’re not welcome without a judicial warrant, and that we’re ready to respond if we need to. And so this is part of the, kind of, brave new world that we’re in right now.

Jennifer Arnold: I’m Jennifer Arnold. I’m gonna be helping convene the caucus for my area. I know that a lot of my neighbors aren’t coming. I know that because last year I supported a bunch of folks to participate in the caucus process who hadn’t participated before, who speak Spanish. I accompanied folks and interpreted. And this year, none of those people are gonna participate. There is added security, but I would say no, there was nothing we could do to make it safe as long as they had to leave their homes to get here. How can you have democracy under occupation?

Applebaum: That’s also pretty reminiscent of things we’ve probably both seen before. When you have armed people on the street, then people are afraid to come out. Even people who have the right to vote, even people who are citizens. The presence or the expectation of violence scares people away from democracy. It sounds like people in Minnesota have been trying to do their best and keep these caucuses safe. But what could this suggest about what democratic participation in the United States might look like in the months ahead? I mean, that’s little-d democrat, not participation in the Democratic Party, but could this kind of military presence on the street scare people from voting?

Worth: I think it could. And one little indicator there: When I was in Minneapolis, and I was all over the city, and I saw very few Black faces, very few brown faces, in a city with a substantial minority population. And I think that’s because so many of them are afraid to come out. They were hiding inside their houses. They were having groceries delivered to them by their neighbors. And as we heard on that tape, many of them would be frightened to come out. And so if this gets replicated, if there’s a spreading of feelings of fear, the most vulnerable people will be frightened to turn out. And on the broader point, you and I have covered referenda in dictatorships and places where people are ostensibly allowed to come out and have their voices heard, but in fact, they know, number one, that they’re surrounded by soldiers. No doubt, that makes them feel terrified. Number two, they don’t trust that their vote is private and they probably feel that if they don’t pull the right lever, someone’s gonna come knocking on their door that night.

I don’t think we’re anywhere near that here, but when I was in Minneapolis, I did speak to people who said that after some kind of confrontation with ICE, the agents would then follow them—drive, follow them back to their houses, not to bang on the doors or anything, but just as an intimidation tactic to let them know, We know where you live. Just the very fact that they were willing to do that was shocking. The very fact that that fear is now entering into the political process, the caucus process, is a troubling one.

Applebaum: It’s true, and this may be something that a lot of Americans don’t know, just the act of voting doesn’t make democracy. So the vote itself alone isn’t enough. It’s about the preparation for the vote, the atmosphere in which it takes place, the way in which candidates are chosen. Of course, it’s the way the votes are counted, which is another issue. But I think a lot of people have a very simple idea of what it means to be a democracy, but actually you need a level playing field. You need people to have a sense that the vote was fair and that the process is fair. And what worries me is that this use of armed people on the streets is one of several ways in which we could lose that.

Worth: It’s a frightening thought. Elections become charades in a lot of autocratic countries. They are a way for the regime to maintain some kind of facade of legitimacy. But very few people actually feel that they’re exercising their right to vote when they go out on these referenda.

            <div id="article-text">The following is a transcript of the episode:

Dawn Baldwin Gibson: For more than 35 years, I have been a registered voter and I have been casting my vote. To this day, months later, I still don’t know why my vote was being challenged.

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum.  This season, we’ve been talking about the Trump administration’s unprecedented accumulation of power. But we’re still missing one piece of the story: the elections themselves. We’ve heard people talk about how they fear soldiers on the streets could intimidate voters, or how crypto barons could try to manipulate campaigns. But the [Donald] Trump White House is also very interested in elections: how voters are registered, how they vote, how those votes are counted.

Across the country, state governors and legislators, sometimes inspired by Trump’s false claims about the 2020 elections, are enacting new voter-ID rules; they’re changing registration requirements and crafting lists of voters to purge from the rolls.

Dawn Baldwin Gibson is a pastor in New Bern, North Carolina. She’s one of more than 60,000 North Carolina voters who had the legitimacy of their vote challenged in 2024.

Gibson: One of the races on the ballot was for the North Carolina Supreme Court. The election was between Allison Riggs and Jefferson Griffin. I actually went to vote as an early voter, and this is something that for many years I have done with my family. Showed my ID, went in, cast my vote, and really thought nothing else about it until a couple of weeks went by. I started hearing about this Jefferson Griffin list.

ABC11 newscaster: Republican candidate Griffin is challenging more than 65,000 ballots in the North Carolina Supreme Court race, arguing—

Gibson: The authority in North Carolina is the State Board of Elections. They were not challenging my vote. They were showing that I had done everything that I was supposed to have done for my vote to count. But Jefferson Griffin’s team, they were the ones challenging my vote. And that seemed like changing the rules after the results are not what you want.

I just thought, Do something! What can I do? So we got a local church. We wrote letters. We talked to the local media.

CBS 17 newscaster 1: After months of back-and-forth legal rulings, the challenge to November’s supreme court election ruling is over.

CBS 17 newscaster 2: Republican Judge Griffin is conceding the race. His decision ends the only election—

Gibson: So yes, in the end we did get our votes to count, but it put a lot of stress. It put a lot of worry. I come from a rural community, and the word we would use is: It was a lot of worry-ation. They felt like—every time I go to vote, Is this what I’m gonna have to put up with? Go vote, and then there’s a challenge.

Gibson: My maternal grandfather, Frederick Douglas Fisher—both of his parents were slaves. He believed in being a part of the American democracy process, and that process was voting, and that we, as his children and grandchildren, had a responsibility to show up and vote, and so there was a great pride in that. And to know that we are now in a time where we are seeing our votes being challenged, it is our responsibility. The breaking down of democracy is not going to happen on our watch. This is our time, where history will look back and say, In 2025, there were people that stood and said: “I will be seen. I will be heard, and my vote will count.”

Stacey Abrams: Voter suppression is one of the core tools of authoritarianism. It is how you shift from democracy to autocracy. And for millions of Americans, it’s about to become the norm.

Applebaum: Stacey Abrams is one of the leading experts on the topic of voter registration and voter suppression. Her work has helped me understand that voter suppression isn’t a single thing or a law, but rather a thousand little cuts and changes, maybe designed to discourage just a few voters but which can make a big difference when elections are as close as ours. She’s the founder of Fair Fight, the voting-rights organization, and she twice ran for governor of Georgia. She’s also the lead organizer of a campaign to fight authoritarianism called the 10 Steps Campaign.  Stacey, what do you make of Dawn’s story?

Abrams:  There are three components to voter suppression: Can you register and stay on the rolls? Can you cast a ballot? And does that ballot get counted? And what she is describing is that third barrier. What we have seen happen over the last decade and a half, since the erosion of the Voting Rights Act, is this wholesale attack on all three of those points of entry to democracy.

Can you register and stay on the rolls? Can you cast a ballot? She covered both of those hurdles, but she got tripped up by: Does your ballot count? And in Georgia, in Texas, across this country, in Florida, North Carolina, we are watching this dramatic acceleration of voter suppression and, sadly, it is going to be the most effective tool used by authoritarians to thwart the will of the people in the next few years.

Applebaum: Okay. Let’s start with gerrymandering, the redrawing of voter-district boundaries. It’s a topic that is not remotely new in America. The word itself comes from Eldridge Gerry, who, while governor of Massachusetts in 1812, designed a voting district that supposedly looked like a salamander, hence gerrymander. So it’s very old practice, but this year, I think for the first time, we have an American president who has asked state governors to create new voter districts and even put quite heavy pressure on some of them in order to give his party an advantage in the midterm. This is now a national project, as opposed to something that happens locally, and it’s also out of season and out of order, because usually voter boundary changes are made after a census.

Now Governor [Greg] Abbott of Texas has already agreed to change boundaries in Texas, even without a census. Am I right that this is new? That the federal government’s involvement in this is different and maybe more dangerous?

Abrams:  There have been maps that have been redrawn in between census years, in between redistricting, but those had been exclusively court-ordered. When lines were drawn that did not conform, the court would take some time to look at these maps. Georgia, almost every single cycle after the Voting Rights Act, had to have its maps adjudicated by a court, and that was true for a lot of southern states.

And so it is not the case that there had never been redrawn districts. It had usually been that those districts were redrawn because the court said, You didn’t do it right the first time. But what we are seeing now, and what you’ve just described, is unprecedented. We have never had a president of the United States explicitly state that the line should be redrawn, not based on population, but based on voter outcome. And when you do that, when you decide that the districts are not designed to allow voters to elect their leaders, it is designed to allow leaders to elect their voters—that is a shift of power, and it is exactly what redistricting is designed to preclude.

Applebaum: What do you make of the response of Governor [Gavin] Newsom to the Texas redistricting? You know, he responded that if this was gonna be a federal-government project, that he was going to also make it a project in California. He held a referendum that has allowed California to also redistrict. I mean, is this just perpetuating the unfairness, or is this a legitimate response?

Abrams: It is a legitimate response because we are in illegitimate times. What is unique in this moment is how aggressively one political party is leveraging this and the ends to which it is being used, which is to overthrow democracy and to install an authoritarian regime. So that is a distinction that is incredibly important if we’re gonna understand what Newsom did. When Trump said that he wanted to redraw those districts, when Abbott complied, when Missouri complied, when North Carolina complied, what they were doing was explicitly trying to strip power away from certain voters. And what Gavin Newsom understands is that performative pragmatism is not the response. This is an open battle for the kind of government we’re going to have. And what he did was not advance the cause of Democrats. He nullified the advance of authoritarianism.

We are going to either win or lose democracy in the next few years. It’s important for us not to think about this in the normative terms of political debate that we tend to have: one party versus the other. You and I both know that autocracies and authoritarian regimes have elections. Venezuela has elections. You know, Russia has elections. But they game before the election begins what the outcome is. The urgency of this moment is that if this holds, there will never again be the opportunity for competition, because if we have a single-party system that does not countenance democracy as the end goal, meaning that people actually get to participate, they will go through the motions, but it won’t really matter, because they’ll change the rules again. Because they will control the means of decision making, meaning they’ll control the presidency and they’ll control both chambers of Congress. And they have a pretty strong lock on the judiciary, which means that we won’t have the debate anymore, because changing the lines won’t matter, because the elections won’t matter.

Applebaum:  Stacey, there’s another form of federal-government interference that the Republicans are also promoting, which is a federal law: the SAVE Act, or the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require in-person voter registration and the presentation of physical documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in federal elections. So they’re asking people for not just a drivers’ license or ID, most of which, I should say, already requires U.S. citizenship to obtain, but for a passport or a birth certificate in addition. And this creates an extra hurdle that people might not think about, or they might not remember to do before the election. Is that the right way to characterize how this law is supposed to work?

Abrams: The SAVE Act has disproportionate effect on very targeted communities: the 69 million women who may have changed their names after marriage, transgender people who may have had name changes. They’re going to say that you don’t have proof of your right to vote, because your name does not match your birth certificate and your Social Security card. That means that millions of people would be disenfranchised and would have to go through multiple hurdles to get back on the rolls. You knock out a group who also are more likely to vote Democratic than Republican.

I wanna be really clear. There are two conditions that are embedded in this argument that are important to understand. One is that you prove your citizenship, and the second is that you prove your identity. In the United States, both proofs are already required. This is not new. And, more importantly, there has been no discernible harm done to elections because people have not met these conditions. So it’s really, really important that we understand that this is a solution that has no problem. Republicans and Democrats both acknowledge—in fact, there was a report that came out after the 2020 election—we don’t have voter fraud in this country. It’s hard enough getting people to vote. People don’t really engage in trying to vote more than once, and people who do not have the right to vote, it is an extraordinary rarity that they will try.

Applebaum:  Right so there was no problem of noncitizens voting.

Abrams: There’s no problem with noncitizens voting. There’s no problem with non-ID voting. You have always had to prove who you are to cast a ballot. The issue was not Did you have to prove it? It was How did you prove it?

Applebaum: Does this requirement affect other groups? What about Black voters?

Abrams: Well, if you were born in the United States during Jim Crow and you were Black, you were legally not permitted to be born in a hospital, which meant that the birth certificate that you got was filed with the county, but it was not the original birth certificate from the hospital. So Black people, thousands and thousands of Black people, do not have an original birth certificate; 146 million Americans do not have a passport. Working-class and low-income Americans tend not to have that paperwork, and if they do, it’s not easily accessible. And so that is why in the U.S. we’ve created systems to allow you to prove your citizenship in other ways. And by changing those rules, you are lining up communities that will not be able to participate in elections.

Applebaum:  Would the lack of participation not also hurt Republicans? Again, there are a lot of Republicans who presumably don’t have passports and don’t have birth certificates.

Abrams: It does. And that’s one of the reasons I think this should be a bipartisan fight. Because when you try to break democracy by targeting one community, the problem is: You break it for everyone. And so they are willing to risk it because they think it will help them more than it will hurt them.

And the reason it matters is that when you tell the average person, You’re not allowed to vote, they’re gonna get mad. But it’s unlikely that they’re going to go to court to force the issue. And in a year, and in a nation, where margins of thousands of voters, not millions of voters, decide the outcome, if the federal government controls that data, if they can manipulate that information, they can then start to attack thousands and thousands of voters and win on the margins—not by actually winning the election, but by forcing voter suppression to lead people to simply not bother trying. And that has the same effect as not voting.

Applebaum: I also want to talk about your own experience with this. So, after you ran for governor of Georgia in 2018, you raised a lot of questions about whether voter-suppression tactics by your opponent had influenced the race. You sued. And, of course, you acknowledged the outcome of the race in the end, that he would be governor, and you wouldn’t. But there was a nuance to your position that opened you up for criticism. I wonder if you could explain the nuance.

Abrams:  The tradition in politics is that once an election is over, you use the word concede. And as someone who is not only a lawyer but also a writer, words matter to me. They have meaning; they have heft. But I’m also the daughter of two civil-rights activists. My father was arrested when he was 14, registering Black people to vote in Mississippi. And so I take very seriously, and it has been my life’s work, since I was 17, to focus on the access to democracy that is contained within the right to vote.

And so when I gave my speech on the night that we realized, despite the very clear and unambiguous voter-suppression tactics leveraged by my opponent, I said, He won. I was very clear about that. I said he was going to be governor. I was not, but I refused to use the word concede, because concession in that statement meant to say that the system that he leveraged was true or correct or proper, and I could not in good conscience say that. I never once questioned whether or not he became the governor. I questioned the system that allowed him and his cohorts to block access to the right to vote for thousands and thousands of Georgians. And because I refused to use the word concede, it became weaponized. But I never once filed a suit to make myself governor. I never once filed a personal suit. Trying to dislodge him. Every lawsuit that was filed was about the system itself. It was never going to solve the problem of me not winning. It was always in service of: How do we ensure that voters have their rights protected?

Applebaum:  Right. Right. So that’s very different from the 2020 campaign, when Donald Trump tried to overthrow the results of an election.

Abrams: Absolutely. And it’s a distinction that anyone with good faith or with good hearing can discern. Running for office does not guarantee you victory, but being a citizen in this country should guarantee you access to the right to vote.

Abrams: I fundamentally believe, based on what I’ve watched this country do, what we have watched other nations do, that we can indeed fight back. But you cannot fight if you do not understand the opposition.

Applebaum: Stacey, it’s illogical to think that illegal immigrants are eagerly voting in American elections, and there is no evidence that they do. Why would they want to attract that kind of attention from the government? Nevertheless, the administration, the Republican Party, MAGA media have been talking for years and years and years, actually, about illegal immigrants voting, even, as you say, proposing legislation to prevent it. Is this because they genuinely fear illegal voters? Or does it have a different purpose? Maybe the point is to create hysteria about an unfair election in advance, just in case the Republicans lose. That would give them an excuse to refuse to swear in new members of Congress. Or maybe they want to intimidate legal voters.

Abrams:  Lies work. (Laughs.) Lies are a very effective deterrent for voter participation. But there’s also the micro issue. When people think that they might be arrested if they show up, then they won’t vote. If people believe that there is some harm they will face, they won’t show up. When people think that it is going to be too hard, when they think that it is going to be dangerous, they don’t vote.

So let’s look at New Jersey in 1981. New Jersey had a tendency to have armed folks standing in the polling places where Black people were voting. And based on that behavior, they were actually denied, the Republicans were denied, the right to do election observation for 30 years. The reason it became so important was that people would say, I’m not going to vote, because I could be arrested. Not that they had done something wrong, but they were afraid of being arrested because you had law enforcement patrolling voting places.

Applebaum: I mean, look. The establishment of ICE as a kind of paramilitary, a federal police that’s not just used to enforce the law but to intimidate people, as well as the decision to send the National Guard into American cities has already got one governor, Governor [J. B.] Pritzker of Illinois, to say that these decisions are not just about fighting crime or public safety, but about creating a pretext to send armed military troops into communities now or during the 2026 election. So it sounds like you think that’s a possibility.

Abrams:  I think it’s a likelihood, because we’ve seen it happen. In Georgia, Hancock County, deputy sheriffs followed Black men home. And that behavior was so egregious that Black men started calling the county, saying, Please take my name off of the voting rolls, because I don’t want the sheriff coming back to my house. That was a decade ago.

We know that when people are afraid, they will do what they can to protect themselves and their families. And just in case the fear isn’t real enough, this administration, suborned by Republicans at every level of government, are willing to threaten the possibility of harm in order to game winning an election. And the reason they are doing this so aggressively is because they believe that if they can do it, they will control every level of government and every lever of power. Authoritarianism isn’t about winning a single election. It is about dismantling a democratic system and installing a system that lacks accountability and has unchecked power. That’s what they’re after, and we cannot be so naive as to think that this is just about who wins a race. This is about who wins America.

Applebaum:  I thought that it was illegal for armed troops, certainly military, to be anywhere near polling booths on Election Day. Is that not the case?

Abrams: I will say it this way: It’s illegal if you note them. But let’s be clear, there are only a few places ICE is not permitted to go. And because they are masked, because they’re unidentified, it is not just the actual harm—it’s the specter of harm. That’s what we have to be thinking about. It’s not just the explicit violation of the law; it’s the implicit threat that the law permits them to exercise. And when the U.S. Supreme Court said that you could detain people based on their race, their accent, or the language they spoke, when you said that ICE could do that, there is nothing to preclude ICE from doing that while you’re standing in line getting ready to cast a ballot. So you may not have the National Guard there, but ICE is not actually military.

Applebaum:  I want to move way upstream in this discussion of elections, from the actual voting to the culture of election information and voter engagement. Here’s an example: TikTok may be about to change from Chinese ownership to U.S. ownership, and the new owners could be U.S. billionaires who are friendly to Trump. We know that TikTok is one of the main sources of political information for young people. Do you think that this change in ownership could be deliberately designed to alter perceptions of the coming campaign, to change how people feel about the candidates? Is that something that counts as election interference? And if so, how do we think about it?

Abrams: Not only is it possible—it is highly likely. Half of young people get their news right now from TikTok and YouTube. Voting is as much a cultural event as it is a practical one. I vote in part because my parents used to take us with them to vote. I watched my parents vote in every election. It was part of our culture. We knew that voting was an important thing to do. There’s a young woman, Esosa Osa, who started a company, an organization called Onyx Impact, and she has done extraordinary research into how disinformation intentionally targeted Black people. It works as a voter-suppression tool.

Abrams: To convince them not to vote or that their votes don’t matter or that the vote that they have taken is somehow being manipulated. And it works. If you have conversations with those in the Latino population, they will tell you about the very subtle language that got inserted into conversations that they were listening to on the radio, that reminded them that their participation would be akin to supporting a regime that their families escaped from a decade before. And so, yes, culture is absolutely upstream, but when it floods the zone, it changes outcomes.

Applebaum: Stacey, this is the last episode in a season that’s been exploring the administration’s power grab from several angles. We have noted: This is not just arming ICE and sending the National Guard to cities. It’s not just the construction of a biased civil service. It’s not just the reshaping of culture and science. It’s not just the direction of cryptocurrency profits to congressional campaigns. It’s all of these things put together. How should listeners think about the defense of democracy? Is it a state-by-state effort? Is it issue by issue? Should we have a unified national approach?

Abrams: So the Constitution gives oversight of elections to state government. We don’t have a single democracy. We have 50-plus different democracies operating at any given moment. And so, yes, part of the solution is going to be a state and local solution because the ripple effects of this will reach every level of government. We may be having conversations about Congress, but we’ve gotta understand that this will affect city councils and school boards and county commissioners and state legislatures. It will affect everything that government is responsible for delivering or not delivering. And so we have to have a localized response. That means more people have to volunteer to be poll watchers. More people have to organize to ensure that their communities understand what the votes actually count towards.

The young woman at the top of this conversation from North Carolina, she got it—that it wasn’t just about whether or not a supreme-court justice in North Carolina got seated. It was whether or not kids in that school were going to get lunch, because the elections that are happening decide: How do we respond to SNAP benefits being cut? How do we respond to the ACA subsidies being diminished? How do we respond to disabled veterans being fired from their jobs because of the anti-DEI executive orders? Those are all of a piece, and so we have to have a multilayered, multipronged response to what is a multilayered, multipronged attack.

But I fundamentally believe, based on what I’ve watched this country do, what we have watched other nations do, that we can indeed fight back. But you cannot fight if you do not understand the opposition. We could win. But we are very, very, very likely to lose if we keep treating this as business as usual. This is not about whether this Democrat wins or that Republican wins. This is about whether democracy wins or authoritarianism wins.

Applebaum:  Thank you so much, Stacey Abrams.

Applebaum: And thank you all for listening. I hope that you’ve also concluded that this is not business as usual. The Trump administration is making deep changes to our political system and to the nature of our government. They are doing so with an eye towards tilting the playing field, shaping the elections in November, and, of course, the next presidential election, in 2028. If we want to keep our elections free and fair, not just this time but into the future, all of us will have to pay attention, take part, join campaigns, learn about local candidates, communicate with others, and vote. We don’t want this to be the last chance.

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

The CIA World Factbook occupies a special place in the memories of elder Millennials like me. It was an enormous compendium of essential facts about every country around the world, carefully collected from across the federal government. This felt especially precious when the World Factbook went online in 1997 (it had previously been a classified internal publication printed on paper, then a declassified print resource), a time when the internet still felt new and unsettled. Unlike many other pages on the World Wide Web, it was reliable enough that you could even get away with citing it in schoolwork. And there was a special thrill in the idea that the CIA, a famously secretive organization, was the one providing it to you.

Memories are now the only place the World Factbook resides. In a post online yesterday, the agency noted that the site “has sunset,” though it provided no explanation for why. (The agency did not immediately reply to my inquiry about why, nor has it replied to other outlets.) The Associated Press noted that the move “follows a vow from Director John Ratcliffe to end programs that don’t advance the agency’s core missions.”

The demise of the World Factbook is part of a broad war on information being waged by the Trump administration. This is different from the administration’s assault on truth, in which the president and the White House lie prolifically or deny reality. This is something more fundamental: It’s a series of steps that by design or in effect block access to data, and in doing so erode the concept of a shared frame for all Americans. “Though the World Factbook is gone, in the spirit of its global reach and legacy, we hope you will stay curious about the world and find ways to explore it … in person or virtually,” the CIA wrote in the valedictory post. Left unsaid: You’re on your own to figure it out now.

If the World Factbook was indeed shut down because it didn’t meet Ratcliffe’s standard for core CIA functions, that reflects the Trump administration’s impoverished view of the government’s role. The World Factbook was a public service that helped Americans and others around the globe be informed, created a positive association with a shadowy agency, and spread U.S. soft power by providing a useful service free to all. I’ve been unable to determine how much it cost the government to maintain, but there’s no reason to think it would be substantive.

At least the raw information the World Factbook collected is available elsewhere (and the current version of the Factbook is available on the Internet Archive). The same is not true of some of the other casualties in the war on information, which have fallen victim to both ideology and incompetence. The executive branch has removed data from its websites, such as those of the CDC, the Census Bureau, and other departments, or removed the webpages that hosted them. Almost 3,400 data sets were removed from Data.gov in the first month of Trump’s term alone. At the start of the second Trump administration, some nongovernmental bodies worked to preserve government data by scraping information from existing sources. That’s valuable as far as it goes, but it doesn’t help with future data—or data that never get collected in the first place.

As the University of Michigan law professors Samuel R. Bagenstos and Ellen D. Katz write in a new paper, “The Trump Administration has scrapped existing obligations to collect and report racial, ethnic and gender-based data involving law enforcement, education, federal contracts, public health, environmental justice, and social research.” In some cases, the administration has simply stopped collecting information. In others, it has significantly changed what data it collects, especially information related to gender identity and race, because of executive orders from the president.

These shifts may sound abstract, but changes in federal data-collecting can have direct impacts on people’s lives and livelihoods. As NOTUS reported this week, data erasure means it’s harder to disseminate word about opioid drugs, feed hungry Americans, assess U.S. schools, and understand changes in prices. After the CDC’s entire Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System staff was placed on administrative leave in April, maternal-mortality data weren’t collected for months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose commissioner Trump fired last summer, did not report monthly jobs data for October, because of the fall government shutdown—the first time in 77 years that an unemployment rate was not released.

The war on information is perhaps even more dangerous than the war on truth. When people can see evidence that obviously contradicts what the administration is saying, they’re primed to disbelieve the officials. (Case in point: A new Quinnipiac poll finds that only 22 percent of people believe that Alex Pretti’s shooting was justified.) But democracy requires voters having access to accurate and shared information so that they can assess the claims that the government makes. This is what the Trump administration is undermining. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said that everyone was entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. Now it’s not clear that anyone is entitled to any facts at all.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The New England Patriots coach Mike Vrabel leads from his ventricles—not from shallow-chested sentiment but from the pump action of his brawny heart, out of which blood occasionally makes its way to spurt from a split lip after a head bump from one of his players. During the team’s playoff run, the defensive tackle Milton Williams gave Vrabel a celebratory helmet to the mouth. “I forgot Vrabes ain’t got no helmet on,” Williams said, to which Vrabel, a former linebacking great, replied, “I’ve been hit harder than that.”

In Tuesday’s edition of this newsletter, I wrote about how President Trump was ramping up his attacks on the integrity of the midterm elections. I cited the attorney Bob Bauer’s concern that Trump might use ICE to interfere with polling locations. After we’d sent the newsletter, I saw a clip of Steve Bannon saying, “We’re going to have ICE surround the polls come November.” You don’t need to take his statement literally—ICE has about 22,000 agents, and the country has had some 100,000 polling places in recent cycles—but this comment from an influential MAGA voice is another reason to take the threats to fair elections seriously.

            <div id="article-text">CONFIDENTIAL: To a billionaire trying to determine what to do with $250 million in 2013,

That kind of pocket change can buy you a newspaper. And not just any newspaper, but a world-class paper with a wall full of Pulitzers (I remember emerging from the elevator and marveling at it as a summer intern) and decades of experience holding power to account.

Alternatively, $250 million can buy half a superyacht. A yacht is a very big boat.

That newspaper employs hundreds of journalists. These journalists work very hard to find out what is actually happening and then to tell people. This involves a lot of late nights eating pizza in the office and long days calling people who will not answer and showing up in inconvenient places at inconvenient times to get people on the record and to get the story right. Is newspaper work glamorous? Put it this way: Spotlight was a Hollywood movie made exclusively to show off how heroic newspaper journalism is, and The New York Times ran an interview with the costume designer to find out how she managed to make the cast look so authentically unfashionable and rumpled. (“The hardest thing is making bad clothes work on really famous people, who look gorgeous in everything they wear,” the costumer explained.)

Newspapers have multiple deks too (that’s some technical headline humor for you; the dek is the little subtitle under the headline that explains the headline you just read). They also have ledes (the start of a story) and are made by people filing (turning in their stories). I remember that when I first got hired at a newspaper, I kept telling people I couldn’t hang out, because I “had to file,” and my friends thought I had suddenly become obsessed with personal organization.

A yacht will never turn a profit, and it would be confusing to expect it to. But you know that your net worth is such that if the yacht never supports itself, you will still be proud to call yourself the yacht’s owner and will not suddenly say, “Well, perhaps if we just pivoted part of the yacht sharply to the right and knocked dozens of people off, the yacht would suddenly become self-sustaining.”

A newspaper can certainly turn a profit. One way for a newspaper to make a profit is if you keep its subscribers from canceling their subscriptions en masse.

If your yacht fails to endorse a candidate for president in an existential election, people will say, “Good. A boat should not endorse candidates for president.”

A newspaper is a public service. If it does its job, people will have better information and better lives—difficult to quantify in monetary terms, but for a long time, we used to think that making people’s lives better was important and valuable. Andrew Carnegie did not demand to see exponential growth from his libraries.

You can give your yacht whatever name you want! Sunk-Cost Fallacy, Ship O’ Theseus, Redacted, Democracy Dies in Darkness.

A newspaper can take down a president—and has, in fact. (Of course, that requires guts from its owner. But you have guts, don’t you?)

A yacht is a good place for a foam party!

A newspaper is a guardian of the First Amendment. Thomas Jefferson said that “were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”

Your yacht will never find out anything damning about your business. Your yacht will never find out anything troubling about the current administration. Your yacht will never report the names of slain children and abuses of government power and give a voice to grief and to silliness alike.

If the captain you have put in charge of your yacht keeps yelling that the yacht needs to be more nimble and take on 200 million more people, and you discover that instead of making the yacht more nimble, he has just punctured an enormous hole in the hull, causing water to rush in, this won’t leave hundreds of world-class journalists without jobs.

Nobody will keep filing from a war zone even with the looming threat of layoffs because they believe in the yacht so much. Nobody believes in the yacht at all.

If the yacht starts to sink, the captain will have to tell everyone on board in person.

If you have a midlife crisis and buy a yacht and then later stop caring as much about the yacht and want to go to space instead, you can simply dock the yacht and ignore it forever and an entire city will not immediately suffer as a result. When a newspaper is felled by careless or malicious owners, millions of people are hurt, in big ways and small ways and ways that are impossible to measure. That includes the journalists directly affected, of course, and then all of the people whose stories won’t get told, and then all of the readers whose mornings will be made just a little bit worse by the absence of their favorite comics or their favorite columns, all of the people who won’t know as much about their country or their neighbors—the restaurants they could visit, the shows they could see, the television they should avoid at all costs. This will leave big holes and little holes and invisible holes.

Think carefully before you buy. Do you really want to own a newspaper? Do you really have what it takes? Or do you just want to own another yacht? Please be honest with yourself, or we’re all going to be worse off.</div>

            <h2>You’ve Never Seen Super Bowl Betting Like This Before</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/super-bowl-prediction-markets-kalshi/685899/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nothing makes Americans want to gamble like the Super Bowl. Every year, the game is reliably the biggest day for sports betting: On platforms such as FanDuel and DraftKings, people are already putting money down on which team will win the opening coin toss, how long the national anthem will be, and what color of Gatorade will be used to douse the winning head coach.

Gambling on sports has become practically inescapable. Nearly half of American men ages 18 to 49 maintain an active online sports-betting account, and Vegas odds have invaded telecasts and talk shows. During NFL games, sportsbook commercials now outnumber beer ads. Despite all of that, more than a third of adults still cannot legally gamble from home: Online sports betting remains banned in 18 states, including California and Texas.

But for the past year, thanks to a loophole, Americans have effectively been able to bet on sports no matter where they live. All they have to do is turn to prediction markets. Platforms such as Kalshi let people wager on lots of things: Who will win the Oscar for Best Actor? How much snow will New York City get this month? Prediction markets say that they are more akin to the stock market than gambling. Rather than betting on odds set by bookmakers, users trade contracts that pay out according to the outcome of a given event. This distinction may not mean much for someone betting on the Seahawks over the Patriots, but it does allow prediction markets to operate even in places where sports betting is illegal.

Now America is about to find out what it really looks like when sports betting takes over. Kalshi, one of the country’s biggest prediction markets, launched its sport-betting operation just two weeks before the 2025 Super Bowl. This year, Kalshi has already seen more than $167 million in bets on the game, and that number could conceivably crack $1 billion, Dustin Gouker, a gambling-industry analyst, told me. Some of the biggest traditional sportsbooks and fantasy-sports sites, recognizing a work-around to enter states where gambling remains illegal, are seizing the opportunity: Since September, FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics, PrizePicks, and Underdog have all launched their own prediction-market offerings.

In one sense, prediction markets are about a whole lot more than sports. Both Kalshi and its biggest rival, Polymarket, have turned prediction markets into big business by letting people wager on seemingly everything. As Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour put it in October, the company’s goal is to “financialize everything”—to let people bet on the outcome of virtually any event. By encouraging people to put their money where their mouth is, the thinking goes, prediction markets can forecast how the future will play out. Even if you’ve never placed a bet yourself, prediction markets’ odds about news and entertainment—not sports—are especially in your face. Both CNN and CNBC recently announced partnerships with Kalshi to incorporate the site’s predictions into their news coverage; last month, the Golden Globes displayed Polymarket’s odds throughout its broadcast.

Kalshi may let you bet on topics as wide-ranging as whether Iran’s supreme leader will stay in power and who will win the next season of Survivor, but sports account for more than 90 percent of all trading volume on the site. From mid-December to mid-January, wagers on college basketball alone exceeded trading on everything other than sports. The single biggest non-sports market during this stretch—about whom President Trump would nominate as chair of the Federal Reserve—drew less activity than Italian soccer. In an email, Jack Such, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the categories that dominate the platform fluctuate based on what’s in the news. “During the NFL season, we are heavily tilted towards sports,” he wrote. “During the 2024 election season, we were heavily tilted towards politics. It all depends on what events are top of mind for the public.” Even though politics was big on Kalshi during the most recent presidential election, that was before the site offered sports betting.

Sports make up a smaller proportion of wagers on Polymarket, which has also yet to fully launch in the United States (although some Americans likely still access it by using virtual private networks). “At this moment in time, the use case of prediction markets, at least in the United States, appears to be the expansion of sports betting,” Gouker said. “It’s hard to come to another conclusion.”

This covert expansion of sports betting is controversial. Several states are suing Kalshi for operating an unlicensed sports-betting platform, which they argue deprives them of tax dollars. But late last month, Michael Selig, the newly appointed head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates prediction markets, indicated that he intends to help grow the prediction-market industry. All of which suggests that, in the immediate term at least, prediction markets are likely to make sports betting an even more pervasive part of American life—potentially leading to devastating consequences. Research suggests that avid sports bettors are at risk of depleting their household savings, declaring bankruptcy, and even committing intimate-partner violence.

Not all prediction markets, for their part, are likely to be content with staying de facto sports-betting sites. After all, Kalshi and Polymarket want to harness the wisdom of crowds to forecast all kinds of real-world events, not just sports outcomes. Despite Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s recent proclamation that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now,” these platforms have much to prove on that front. When most bets are on sports, it’s especially hard to see what value prediction markets add. The kind of information gained by thousands of bettors laying down four-legged parlays on a Tuesday-night NBA game does not have the same utility as a more accurate hurricane forecast or election prediction. Not all knowledge, in other words, is created equal.

Perhaps prediction markets are hoping that once sports betting gets users in the door, they’ll engage with the many other markets on offer. “I think they’ve really thought that sports would just be an entry point, and then everything else would start growing,” Gouker said. But that Kalshi will be able to interest its droves of sports bettors in other markets is by no means guaranteed. In fact, it seems at least equally plausible that people might just prefer betting on the Super Bowl to betting on whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. “People who are making forecasts on political and social and scientific outcomes are possibly different from people who are betting on sporting events,” John Phillips, the CEO of Aristotle, the company that runs the prediction market PredictIt, told me. “There are some commonalities there, but I think it’s a different type of activity and it attracts a different type of trader.”

If the goal of Kalshi and other prediction markets is to create something with genuine financial utility and predictive power, that’s a big problem. But this won’t prevent them from making a boatload of money along the way.</div>

            <div id="article-text">If you think addictive design isn&#39;t a thing, I suggest you visit Las Vegas and walk through any casino gaming floor. You&#39;ll find it a disorienting experience beyond anything you&#39;ll encounter elsewhere. Flashing lights, constant noise, lack of reference points to tell where you are. Hells, even the carpets are custom designs for the casino featuring abstract patterns in contrasting colors that confuse your sense of direction. And to top it off, mirrors everywhere that reflect the floor and make the space seem larger than it is. All of it&#39;s designed very deliberately to achieve an effect: leave you confused about where you are, what direction you need to go to get somewhere, even what time it is. The goal: keep you wandering the gaming floor for as long as possible so you have the greatest chance of getting attracted to the games and starting to play and the greatest chance of not realizing how long you&#39;ve been there or how much you&#39;ve truly spent playing.

Douyin - the Chinese version of TikTok - is very different from what TikTok is in the West.  While the latter inspires various types of narcissistic and degrading behavior, such as twerking or gluttony, the former is an absolutely wholesome platform that inspires its users to be the best versions of themselves.  One doesn&#39;t see Chinese in China engaging in the same sort of antics that people in the West do: there&#39;s no way the Beijing regime would tolerate it

I would expect Canada to have the same &quot;large country&quot; problem we do and go more towards hybrids. They also have cheap hydro as well which helps EV adoption.

Sprawl is incredibly expensive to service. Suburbs are probably the most inefficient way to deal with housing ever invented, between having to deliver utilities, expand fire protection and policing, and just plain road maintenance, there&#39;s a reason that we should eschew suburbs and sprawl in favor of density.

Not me...I gave up sharing walls with other people when I quit being a broke college student having to live in apartments.

I like having a nice big back yard fenced in for my dog to run around in, to

Your way of life is effectively subsidized, and at some point it simply will not be affordable. The difficulty supplying water alone in many parts of the US will basically cause suburbs to die. Your notion of personal freedoms cannot override reality, no matter how often you pound the table.

Then let the wealthy go first and make sacrifices, since they have the resources to do that.  Then I will follow once there are mature solutions to this.  Carbon tax in Canada was beautiful because the wealthy could drive there yachts and were contributing proportionately with everyone else.

>Then let the wealthy go first and make sacrifices

Yeah, like that will ever happen! Lol. Until it is immoral to be stinking rich, nothing will change.

People have raised families in all manner of housing arrangements. Don&#39;t confuse cultural norms with actual human requirements.

But people still need to drive there.  Who will put chargers where there is nothing but black flies?

If you have a road going through a 400km area of nothingness and many EVs coming through there are going to have less than 400km range then you need a charger there somewhere.  Or are we going to just abandon public routes because EVs?  This will cut off entire towns and villages.  There are many roads that are just on ice that go for hundreds of kilometers that are vital to communities.

Yes we&#39;ve all seen &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot; on TV.  No one is suggesting that those or other vehicles in remote communities be replaced by EVs (unless there is a major advance in technology).  Saying we can move to 90% EVs because of the 2% of niche case that can&#39;t use EVs is a disingenuous argument.

Ok but if we move to 90% EVs then eventually someone will need to drive that with an EV.  You are suggesting we don&#39;t talk about glaring problems with the technology and just accept being forced into it with obvious hindrances?

Battery technology IS improving, so by the time we get to that 90% point, we will probably see 400+ mile ranges from EVs.

I&#39;m really wonder how many &quot;no this time they are doing solid state batteries really&quot; articles I&#39;m going to read before they happen.

The thing that I&#39;d be worried about is that when you get to that EV charging station in the middle of nowhere, it&#39;s out of service and you&#39;re basically screwed.

Maybe it got hit by a snow plow. Maybe it got vandalized by some anti EV luddites. Maybe the company who built it just can&#39;t afford to maintain it anymore. Either way, you&#39;re still screwed.

Well yes so now there needs to be two or three times the required chargers along the route.

And there ain&#39;t going to be any Internet for miles around either.

And there ain&#39;t going to be any Internet for miles around either.

Ok I&#39;m with ya on all the other comments and arguments, except this one.

I grew up before there WAS an internet.....being without it is no big deal.

Sure it makes life fun, but its no big deal to go without it for spans of time.

Pretty much all chargers rely on phone apps and Internet access as far as I understand, and many EV drivers say they need to use their cars displays to find chargers

How does that argument not also apply to gas stations in the middle of nowhere?

Gas stations with snacks in the middle of nowhere are a much more profitable business and also require much less power than chargers in the middle of nowhere.  So they are much more prevalent.  Also if you know you are going into an area without gas you have the option of carrying some with you.

People have to be at EV chargers for 15+ minutes so it makes no sense to not put snacks at the hypothetical EV charger in the middle of nowhere.

Well the reality of that involves a lot of math.  The electricity price that people pay to charge needs to support the massive infrastructure to bring the electricity there plus manning the station and having an employee there in a place that is desolate.  That could work, or it could make it prohibitavely expensive for most people to charge anyway.

I live in southern BC. We haven&#39;t had a snowfall here that lasted more than a few hours, and almost the entire winter has been above 0.

Southern BC is probably one of the very warmest places in Canada.  It&#39;s clear that the whole Pacific coast is better.

Tell that to the people in Norway where EV adoption is through the roof...

And no, don&#39;t tell me that Canada is much larger. That&#39;s not the &quot;large country&quot; problem. The large country problem means: if you are driving more than a day in the same direction, do you pass enough infrastructure for your mode of transport? And that&#39;s as valid for Norway as it is for Canada.

But how many EVs are away from the coast in Norway?  As far as I understand it, most people live on the coast.  Also I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say you can take trains around Norway if you are going somewhere an EV may be awkward.

That train will not be coast to coast in my lifetime.  Too many areas where the found is just too unstable.

The USA doesn&#39;t have high speed rail outside of the occasional talk about something getting built.

Yet there is room for Oslo which is on the coast.  The point being that it hardly goes below -10 there.  How many people actually live and have EVs where it is -30c?

This is relevant because people are uniformly distributed in Canada and Nunavut has the same population density as the Quebec Cityâ&quot;Windsor Corridor...

There are way more people in Canada that are not within 4 hours from the US border.  Millions.  There are millions that live in cities not on the TransCanada highway where they put chargers.  There are no trains here and taking an airplane has gotten rediculously expensive.  I would prefer my mode of travel to be as reliable as possible with as little dependency on infrastructure as possible.

85% of the population lives in urban areas, the average commute time is well under half an hour. Quit making shit up.

Around 85% of Canadians live in urban areas, and the average one-way commute time is around 27 minutes (and about 9km or about 5.6 miles). It&#39;s a bit bigger in larger cities like Vancouver or Toronto, but then again those cities have public transit, so many people can get by without having to drive a car, at least to work.

Most people do not live 50 miles from the workplace, so an EV would be sufficient. With more Chinese imports about to appear, my next vehicle will almost certainly be an EV, and I&#39;ll keep

People buy a vehicle to serve all their purposes, not 90% of their purposes.  Putting it another way, if the vehicle is going to be useless to me 10% of the time, it had better be 10% cheaper.

That sounds about right.  Except maybe for people who don&#39;t drive anywhere except to their nearby pharmacy and grocery store

How in debt are people living in Toronto who have an old house on a postage stamp lot that they had to sink $1 million or more into?  400k isn&#39;t actually that bad at all.

The point is that if it is managable and considered realistic for families then it&#39;s not unreasonable for the country.  Keep in mind that money the government spends is also an investment in the health and well being of its people.  It also circulates through the economy so it&#39;s not like a house.

How do you define &quot;out of control&quot;. Canada&#39;s credit rating, even with the economic assaults of our neighbor, remains very good and very stable. There&#39;s no massive hike in borrowing costs.

It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re just making shit up.

Maybe running a government and running a family are different?

And it helps every family when you spend.... So?

People really don&#39;t understand the difference between spending money, and investing money in things that will end up making money.   Picture in the USA if the &quot;how will we pay for it?!?&quot; crowd were in charge when the Interstate highway system was built.   Of course, back then, the very wealthy had a top marginal tax rate of 95%, so the wealthy people were paying for a lot of things they are not paying for now.   These days, someone making $50,000 per year pays a higher percentage of their income in taxes th

There is a news story, probably NYT or Politico or BBC (I cannot recall where exactly) that the rejection of the U.S. from Canada is catching on with the rest of the world. There are apps in Europe that will tell you whether some company builds stuff with U.S. parts. Way to go, el Bunko. Are you tired of (*^(&^% winning yet?

Yup people have been saying that for 50 years yet here we are.

Jesus you fucking Trumpers are a pack of idiots. Christ almighty, we actually have an economist running the country, you have a fucking moron knee deep in dementia, who was a raving idiot even when he wasn&#39;t rotting.

Meanwhile they use Chinese electronics and buy energy from Russia.

Oh stop your TDS!  Trump has made those all into wonderful things!

Sounds like a plan to wind down the Canadian auto industry.

Master class is political division.  Let the market get flooded with cheap imports so most folks don&#39;t care, &#39;cars are cheaper then ever!&#39; pretty much assures nobody will stand up for the auto workers losing jobs and future.

Suddenly competition in the market is bad. How odd.

2026: Announce objective of 90% EV by 20402027-2035: Do nothing2036: Announce that the 2040 objective of 90% is not realistic and must be scrapped. But all current politicians involved are going to be out of office/retired.

That&#39;s basically what they did with the 2035 objective.How about they set a realistic objective for the next 4 years (one mandate)? It could be like having 15% EV by 2030.

No, it is clearly the US that are shutting the doors. Very obviously, the Trump administration wants to go it alone - either others accept extortionous terms (why should they?) or nothing. Forget a fair deal. Ok, then don&#39;t be surprised if the rest of the world gives the US the middle finger. All the US has going for themselves is momentum, and that&#39;s quickly drying up. Trust is long gone, good luck to get it back within our lifetimes.

Excellent job agent Krasnov is doing for his master.

That&#39;s what Russia does, and the Putin puppet named Donald Trump is following orders very well.

I have been seeing a lot of articles this year about the range you get from an EV after it parks in -30c over night.  Sounds to me like you will be lucky to get home.

This is brilliant.  It&#39;s just what the Chinese did with Tesla.  1) Invite them in, 2) Learn how to make their cars 3) Use that knowledge to launch local versions. China now makes arguably better electric cars than Tesla, and it looks like the Canadians are going to learn how to do it too.  They certainly have the raw materials for it.

It&#39;s actually pretty obvious that is Trump&#39;s whole strategy and the only way to &#39;reconcile&#39; with him is to give him exactly what he wants.  He is negotiating based on the weight of tariffs that probably isn&#39;t even legal.  Any country that is &#39;cooperating&#39; with him is just trying to appease him and bide their time.

Canada needs to at least wait for the tariff decision from the supreme Court before doing anything.

Canada needs to at least wait for the tariff decision from the supreme Court before doing anything.I don&#39;t think this is wise strategy. From what I read, SCOTUS expected to rule against Trump on tariffs AND there is already Plan B and Plan C ready to go. That is, tariffs are likely to remain in place for the next few years. This is more than enough time for Canadian economy to collapse. Sorry, I don&#39;t like any of this, but I think Canada has no choice but appease Trump like the rest of the world is currently doing.

With each plan its a lot more work and harder to sell to the public with midterms coming.  Also it&#39;s Trump so it&#39;s probably a bluff.  At any rate, you can&#39;t do everything a bully wants because he may hit you.  That&#39;s just not how it works with adults.

Canada has always done far better than the US in economic hard times.  Americans will hurt more than Canadians will.  The tariff for steel and aluminium has already raised the price of cars by an avg of $12k.  You do realize that 40% of the gas in your tank is from Canada.  The Venezuela thing was a rediculous piece of theater.  That country is going to take 10 years just to build enough infrastructure to extract oil, then there is crime and corruption.  The oil companies don&#39;t want any part of that.

Cheeto has shown he rarely holds up his end of the bargain. Now you&#39;re standing there dumbfounded as to why countries aren&#39;t doing business with the US anymore.

You don&#39;t even live in Canada and you act like the country is going to fold up tomorrow. I&#39;ve seen some cult followers in my day but holy shit you&#39;re racing to the front of the line to get that first glass of kool aid.

Considering that the US attacked Canada, why is it Canada&#39;s job to reconcile?

All this is just the consequences of American actions.

Trump&#39;s physical and mental health degrades every day.  If he doesn&#39;t drop dead of a stroke in a few months he&#39;ll be impeached and removed from office after the midterms. The best strategy is to stand up to him now and delay making any agreements with the USA until his replacement takes over.

I know I may never be able to afford one in my lifetime.  I am looking at doing a second across-Canada move in my life with belongings in a tailor and three pets.  I&#39;m very afraid of one day having to try it with an EV.

Silver is down pretty significantly, Gold is essentially flat, the stock market is a touch down over the same time period... Of course the USD in general is down a tad compared to Euro for the time period.

It is not just prices that are rising.What actually is happening is that the dollar is falling like a stone since a year.

On top of that oil/gas (energy in general) is rising. And those are in a huge deal paid in dollar.

Simple math, dollar drops 10%, oil rises 10%, this makes 20% in total.

The price rise in energy affects the whole supply chain. So it adds on every step.

And: energy suddenly got scarce because of AI and a stronger northern winter ... so you have three effects hitting on the same nail.

If they are not convicted, they are not criminals.

For those, like me, who are predicting The Meltdown, this is not it, it is just a bull trap.Previously it was overvalued by 100%, it is still overvalued by 100%.

Crypto culture is dying. It wasn&#39;t much of a culture to begin with, just a bunch of morons who were pumping thin air, but they were excited - they had dreams! They all hated wallstreet and institutions, which excluded them, or so they felt. They were going to show the world! Well, the world was impressed with the amount of money they poured into bitcon and their old enemies from the institiutions showed up and began to take over - and the whole thing became massively awash with husksters and lies and trainw

Scamming is so baked into crypto culture that crypto fans commonly blame the victims for being dumb enough to get caught up in a scam or having their wallet stolen, rather than blaming the criminal or organized the scam. The notion of scam protection (a key part of current financial systems, from credit card fraud rollbacks to bank account insurance) is entirely alien in the crypto world.

The little guy in the crypto world can get scammed endlessly and it&#39;s their fault.  But the whales, it&#39;s different

Another thing is just the massive amount of Dunning-Kruger economics at their core.  For example, bragging about how it&#39;s deflationary.  You don&#39;t want a deflationary currency.  Deflation, or even a lack of inflation, are economically harmful; it crushes your economy, as people don&#39;t want to spend.  Economies are maximized by small, predictable, positive inflation.  Too much or too little, and fluctuations in it, are harmful . Crypto people don&#39;t care about the fluctuations, and celebrate deflation.

Crypto is useless. Do I really need to remind anyone that crypto is useless?There is no specific need for bitcoin in the world, it&#39;s a solution looking for a problem.If I had a bitcoin, I couldn&#39;t do anything with it other than sit on it and pray that it&#39;s worth more some day, but still, in order to derive concrete utility from it I would have to first get rid of it and convert to real money instead.It&#39;s a very formidable waste of resources, akin to growing tulips instead of something useful.You can&#39;t eat tulips. Well even with tulips they might be edible but you could probably grow a lot of potatoes for all the work you dedicate into cultivating a rare tulip.

Exactly. But many people seem to have an education so incredibly bad these days that they do not know or understand that basic fact.

Yup, sure. But... just to play devil&#39;s advocate for a bit... this has been your position since years ago when BTC was at  $1, right? So WHY THE FUCK should anyone listen to you?

YOUR position has been that a tulip is just a flower but I was able to buy a fine house with 1 tulip bulb in 1636. So WHY THE FUCK should anyone listen to you?

Yeah, sanctions busting, online crime, black market sales, etc are the use case of cryptocurrency as a currency, rather than just as a collectible.

IMHO, one of the best-argued cases [wired.com] for Satoshi Nakamoto is Paul Le Roux [wikipedia.org] (a talented cryptography coder and an international crime lord), specifically to make it easier to accept payments and move money around in his criminal empire) (and the reason that Satoshi never spent his Bitcoin is that Le Roux was arrested and his computers seized)

Lol, Wright should be near the absolute bottom of Satoshi candidates [wikipedia.org].

Crypto is NOT useless, it is a currency where anyone can pay anyone,A currency that fluctuates against FIAT currencies as much as crypto does at the speed it does is not useful as a method of payment which is why no legitimate companies or people with a functioning brain accept it as payment. Can I pay my rent with it? No. Can I buy my gas with it? No. Can I buy my grocery shopping with it? No. The only places it&#39;s accepted as payment for goods or services is for dodgy illegal stuff like drugs and kiddy porn on the dark web.

No it is useless, at least if we are talking Bitcoin specifically.

Bitcoin specifically fails at everything it set out to do, other then perhaps resist political pressure to increase supply.  It is to easy for a small number of actors to exert various types of control over the change, even just simple gatekeeping.  It is far to slow and costly to do settlements so its right back to middlemen and batching transactions, complete with the usual financial games like float management etc, entities like exchanges

No it is useless, at least if we are talking Bitcoin specifically.One real sign that you are right about this is that the actual insiders chose to create a separate Trumpcoin, fully separate from Bitcoin when they wanted to use crypto for serious fraud. That is not a vote of confidence from people who actually have access to US government internal information.

Essentially its use is to facilitate some sort of illegal transaction unable to be completed through the normal banking system. For this to be useful it simply has to have some value and be stable enough too not hugely change value while those transfer occur.

Crypto is useful. It can get around international currency transfer limitsIt isn&#39;t useful for those because of how wild and how fast the swings can be. It had a 15% drop over 10hrs yesterday between 14:40 on Thursday and 00:15 Friday morning and it&#39;s still down 5% over the price yesterday. That&#39;s not useful as a currency.

For a currency transfer even that rate of variability is not a problem. You can simply divide your currency transfer into tiny segments and immediately (no more than minutes) convert to and from the cryptocurrency.That doesn&#39;t make sense, though, with Bitcoin because transaction costs are so high. Crypto can only have a chance of success once Bitcoin burns.

When you wake up and find your new (and only) digital fiat currency value swinging in the wind like shitcoin is right now?  It won&#39;t though and we already have the evidence. Most FIAT currency only exists electronically and FOREX trades can be executed 10,000 times faster than a BTC transaction. The reasons that they don&#39;t swing as wildly and as fast as crypto is because those currencies actually have functional use and are backed by governments and central banks.

The primary use of Bitcoin is to have a money that no one can mess with. Unlike your bank account, it can not be blocked or frozen.ROFLMAO. UK law enforcement in 2018 seized 61,000 BTC worth $5Bn [bbc.co.uk]. 5 months ago the US government seized 127,721 BTC worth more than $14bn (£10.5bn) [bbc.co.uk].

Usually this happens because they don&#39;t have their own wallet, but use a service. If you use your own wallet, short of physically restraining you, they can&#39;t do squat.

Bitcoin is not an investment, it is a money with properties that may not seem so relevant now, but could become so when the currency of your country collapses due to government meddling.Exactly, Bitcoin is completely immune to major one-day drops in value.
 
What&#39;s that? It did what? Oh.

Some tulips have edible petals.  Not something you&#39;d want to make a meal out of, but chefs will add them to salads and the like.

I couldn&#39;t do anything with it other than sit on it and pray that it&#39;s worth more some day, but still, in order to derive concrete utility from it I would have to first get rid of it and convert to real money instead.According to your logic, all stock markets are equally as useless.Seems we&#39;ve been deluded for quite some time.

Crypto made the rich even richer. It&#39;s all a grift. Here&#39;s a detailed breakdown. https://archive.ph/NDMbH [archive.ph]

I know a few people who actually did make *some* good money with bitcoin - they were geeks who had actually mined it early in the game - like pre-2010, when it was still computationally very cheap. They had basically ran that miner as a kind of fun little process in the background - same guys who had run things like Seti@Home or Folding@Home.

Then they had forgotten about the whole thing, and 5-10 years later noticed that the little toy is suddenly worth around 10000 USD/EUR per BTC. They sold at that point

It is apparently useful for sex trafficking and terrorism financing???

The worst one will be when crapto gets a realistic value, namely zero. That is sure to happen sooner or later. This one here is just the worst one so far.

All spent playing &quot;Guess The Magic Number!&quot; over and over and over again.

How have these people not realized yet that Bitcoin moves opposite &quot;reserve assets&quot; like gold?  Bitcoin surges during speculative market booms, and crashes when the market is full of fear.  It&#39;s always been this way.  It&#39;s the extreme opposite of a reserve asset.  People buy Bitcoin on the idea of getting some huge market return.  They flee when there&#39;s any signs of the market turning south (people needing to take money out / lack of new money flowing in) so that they&#39;re not left holding the bag and so they

It&#39;s all just an idea at the end of the day.

Gold&#39;s value is just a shared delusion like any other token.

It&#39;s like belief in a god, it&#39;s power is proportional to the number of people who also believe.

Jewelry demand is also intrinsic.  The simple fact is that people like owning gold for reasons other than money.  There may be trends for how much people desire to have gold stuff, but it has value beyond just as money.

Beyond intrinsic values, only a tiny fraction of Bitcoin investors are doing so because they have some notion that if the economy crashes, they&#39;ll be out buying their food with Bitcoin.  It&#39;s purely a speculative temporary transaction - they put money in when they think it&#39;s going to go up an

I&#39;m just going for large-dividend stocks and buying/holding.  Toss it in a DRIP, and just walk off.  I don&#39;t watch the market.  I just walk off.  Alternatively, index funds.  Let people who know more than I figure out where to stick stuff.

I wish the US could start selling &quot;innovation bonds&quot;.  Like war bonds, except aimed at money for PARC/Bell Labs style research to make new stuff, even if it isn&#39;t immediately marketable.

The TL/DR, boring stuff.  If you want to hedge against a potential market implosion, stagflation, etc. you want to be in boring consumer staples, durable goods, and basic services. Even better if the companies are heavily indebted.

For example, picture a company that has $1B income on sales of essential after COGS but $900M in debt repayments. $100M profit and a lot of risk = low valuation.  Then stagflation hits, and the economy racks up a total of 10% inflation.  The company sells just as much volume (they

            <div id="article-text">Indeed. How more respected can you get in a community than publishing the universally recognized frigging reference for all of the world?

Also remember that all conflicts have a major component of perception. This move will make the US less safe.

This stuff worries me.  The US, since WWII, has provided a starting point for the rest of the world in many areas.  From the Internet to GPS, to electricity, to roads... many things that we use today were paved and made available by the US government.

I&#39;m not happy seeing this shift.  IMHO, this shows the US is retreating.  This also shows to allies that the US is not interested in world affairs as much, while China and India are wooing them to join BRICS and dump the dollar, to join their trade bloc.

IMHO, these decisions seem to be made by people who don&#39;t understand basic agriculture.  If you want a harvest, you have to plant something.  Not bothering to plant, or cutting off seed corn means that there won&#39;t be much to bring in.

What would be ideal is the US to maintain some type of library or encyclopedia, not on just countries, but other items.  At least it means there is a vetted [1] source of information which can be cross-checked.

[1]:  It is relative, but at least one can point a finger to a nation-state as a source of truth, or point out it is a bald-faced lie, with the buck stopping there.

I planned ahead, buying one of the last 10 Britannica&#39;s every printed.

I&#39;m ready for the EMP, zombie apocalypse or JD.

Well, but somehow nowadays that is super totally filthy hyper-capitalist, colonialist and misogynist and racist and fascist and literally nothing the US has ever done is good in any way..So shouldnt these people be celebrating that the evil propaganda by CIA is gone? The orange man could have had some facts altered!!!

You can tell the loonies because there can&#39;t hear something critical about the republican administration without instantly trying to drag other people into it

You know this shit is bad otherwise your wouldn&#39;t be trying to kick up dust about whatever straw leftist you dreamed about last night. So why not just admit it and be honest without kicking up dust. You&#39;re favoured side won&#39;t stop sound the things you don&#39;t like while you keep acting like a useful idiot and ruining interference for them.

The great North American stroad is a terrible invention that no one should be copying. It is an almost unique combination of high cost, dangerous to use and prone to traffic jams.

For a start have a system whereby a potential president doesn&#39;t either need to be stinking rich to campaign and/or has to beg for donor money and then owes huge favours to said donors. Make a law that broadcast and online media have to represent all candidates equally and give them free airtime for some agreed length of time and have government moneyt pay for a certain number of campaign visits around your country which if they lose they have to pay back.

Citizens United basically made it impossible. Without a constitutional amendment to rein it in, it&#39;s going to cost ever-increasing amounts of money every election cycle to make a meaningful bid for the White House. I mean, what&#39;s it going to be in thirty years? A hundred billion in donations to make a bid?

The oligarchy has been here for a long time, the Supreme Court&#39;s job is to make sure the oligarchy can never be threatened. And honestly, that&#39;s pretty much what the Framers of the Constitution, all proper

There&#39;s one problem: the rights granted a corporation will be determined by the state in incorporates in, but they apply everywhere.  This  means that it has to be done in *all* the states, or it&#39;s meaningless.  If the rights of corporation are restricted in only some states, the only thing that will be achieved is that all the corporations will register in the states that don&#39;t restrict their rights.

Yeah, I have no more confidence in the states, or sufficient numbers of states, to solve the problem than an amendment.

We already have such a law: the electoral college. If we go back to unbound electors (meaning we vote for electors not candidates), the EC then is supposed to vet a wide range of candidates and elect a president. It was meant to avoid a candidate having to campaign across the whole Eastern seaboard so that non-rich people could run.

... to roads... many things that we use today were paved and made available by the US government.

As a Canadian, I can tell you that your problems are far greater than Trumpism, or whatever Vance and the GOP have in mind for a somewhat less erratic but no less autocratic successor.

Canadians, and most of the rest of the Free World, no longer trust America.

Thankfully we have a parliamentary form of government where a PM like Trump, if his own cabinet and caucus didn&#39;t throw him out, would likely fall in a no confidence vote, which ends his power instantaneously.

Not to mention certain reserve powers lie with the King and their vice-regal representative, and are inaccessible to the government of the day.

But thanks for the implicit threat, which rather proves my point.

Your head is so far up your own ass that you can&#39;t have a simple story about the republican administration doing something short without bleating about teh libruhls.

Besides, the last fucking government entity I would trust to deliver facts, is the CIA. In any decade, under any President. Ever.That&#39;s because you&#39;re stupid.

The Factbook [wikipedia.org] was the US Government&#39;s source of information for the fucking US Government, and its agencies with academic involvement.

Right because the CIA is some fucking Enlightenment Renaissance organization with nothing but good will.

This site is full of emotionally stunted adult children who hoard endless storage capacity for essentially useless purposes.

Here we have an opportunity for you to host all the CIA factbook or contribute financially for someone else to do it.

Or realize it&#39;s not a unique source of information and move on, and not worship the FUCKING CIA of all things!!

Straight from the dictatorship handbook.I would have thought that it could serve as distraction fodder.

I would have thought that it could serve as distraction fodder.

Those are obviously old and stale facts. The most transparent administration in history will provide you with completely new and fresh facts to justify fucking over whichever country is next on the list.

And it will be alternate facts, which are much better!

I remember before smart phones/mobile internet/Wikipedia I could download/install the CIA world Factbook to my visor handspring.

I read it a few times over the years. One of the things it mentioned were the relations between  and United States. For most European countries it was usually &quot;Relations between US and  are warm. Collaboration and cooperation are common in areas of....&quot;.

I guess they would have to chill all those entries shutting things down instead...

I was a big fan back in the day. But to be honest I&#39;ve never used it since Wikipedia arrived.

The last fact...but not added to the fact book, so now fiction. ??? :)

AssassinatedJust like Voice of America, and don&#39;t get me started on USAID.

Samsung&#39;s S-Beam worked without a WiFi network as well - it exchanged the information necessary to set up a WiFi Direct connection over NFC, then did the transfer using the WiFi radio.  It didn&#39;t require a WiFi network or Internet connection to work.  It had the added benefit that you were pretty much guaranteed not to be accidentally sharing the file with the wrong person, because it required putting the phones back-to-back for the NFC handshake.

I am generally for some of the EU crackdowns that are pro-consumer, but in a world full of thousands of messengers and hundreds of other means of sharing any and all data between all devices, AirDrop really isnt a hill to choose for a battle or to die on - neither does it matter whether other phones can send and receive from it.

Actually, I thought there were already pixels in my display, but probably I was mistaken - it&#39;s hard to follow all those technical innovations nowadays.

            <div id="article-text">The move away from MS crap. Not for the reason I expected, but still.

The fatal mistake that Microsoft made was disable the email of the chief prosecutor at the International Court of Law. At that point, it became blatantly obvious and impossible to ignore that MS will do whatever the US administration wants to its international (and probably national) customers. The EU administration observed this event very carefully and drew its conclusions. Obviously, this will be a process over the next 5-10 years or so, but MS is cooked.

What did it take to destroy Microsoft?Corpocracy + fascism + consistently bad US foreign policy.Sort of a perfect storm that turns what probably seemed like a sweet deal for the big tech companies into a nightmare scenario of break up. I bet they wish they still had Biden and the Dems in power, that let corporate interests run much of the government as long as they had diversity policies.

Can the EU actually pull this off?  There are some tools that MS has, which nobody else has:

1:  AD/Entra.  Maybe in the past, we had directory services and policy object servers that could scale up and out, but right now, AFAIK (and please correct me) AD/Entra are the only game in town if you have millions of users and need to handle AAA (authentication, authorization, auditing), of users, machines, and other objects, with GPOs and other policies attached.  Yes, there is FreeIPA/IdM, and it works well, with replication, performance, and security.  I&#39;d assert it has a smaller attack profile than AD.  However, it doesn&#39;t scale as well as AD can.  AD can figure out how to replicate itself, and handle all kinds of oddball conditions.

Note, this can&#39;t be a cloud service.  Ideally, authentication should either be on-prem, or at least hybrid, so even without network connectivity, people can log into their machines and do offline work, even if caching isn&#39;t doable.

2:  A unified file sharing protocol.  NFS v3 doesn&#39;t cut it for users.  NFS v4 takes a well tuned environment to work.  S3 is awesome for objects, but definitely not something you want to use as a VM storage backend.  We need to have a protocol that allows for file sharing with the robustness of S3, but have additional commands for block I/O, so that can be as fast as possible.  This would allow for things like versioning, object immutability, maybe even tiers of compression and encryption.  However, as it stands now, SMB/CIFS is king, with nothing really dethroning it.

3:  Something to replace Outlook/Exchange.  A standardized mail, calendaring suite that has all the C-level features needed.  This can be hard, as there are a lot of systems out there (Google WorkSpace, Zimbra, Zoho)... but feature-wise and usability-wise, MS comes out ahead, if only because people are familiar with it, and it does well enough.

4:  SharePoint.  Don&#39;t laugh, but SharePoint and Confluence are unique programs.  There are other Wiki programs that can do the job, but the ability to import things in and make workflows happen make those two commercial programs extremely useful, especially in maintaining documentation.

5:  GitHub/GHE.  If I have a F/OSS project, and forget about it, I am pretty much certain that 5-10 years from now, it will still be there and usable, perhaps someone finds it, forks it and makes it useful again.  Other Git systems... not so much, and when stuff vanishes, that is history lost forever.  This needs to have government support, and some sanity (so this doesn&#39;t get turned into someone&#39;s personal multi-terabyte storage of videos).  Maybe more space if people &quot;adopt&quot; it.  It also needs to span countries, just so if something happens in Europe, that source code would be available in the US.

6:  MDM/RMM tools.  Intune has its issues, but the Holy Grail would be something that could manage Macs, Windows machines, and many Linux distributions, as well as iOS, and Android devices.  This would be both cloud based as well as available on-prem.  This functionality is critical to a business&#39;s operations, and needs to be integrated into the OS.  Ideally, for Linux, some parameter which can be inputted at install time to have the installer pause, go to a URL, pull code from there and then function like Autopilot or Apple&#39;s ABM provisioning.

7:  I hate to mention this, but an IRM.  Something like MS Purview.  DRM is ugly, but in this case, it can be the one thing that is the difference between exfiltration or no.

8:  A VDI cloud connection broker, as well as a VDI system.  Otherwise, you are paying for Omnissa, Microsoft W365 or AVD, Citrix, or something else, and those are not cheap.  Having a VDI system that is inexpensive and works well with Proxmox can bring a critical security tier to a company.

9:  Don&#39;t laugh... a GPG keyserver combined with transparant GPG in mail apps and webmail.  We have moved away from tried and true encryption to stuff based on &quot;trust me&quot;.  Enough.  We need to see about going back to the GPG standard.

Getting rid of Teams is a positive, but to break MS&#39;s iron grip, there are a lot of other basic enterprise items which need to be made into vetted, maintained, open source projects.

because all the MS centric IT people will block it.That is a concern. A Unix-admin can essentially administrate anything. But an MS admin is a basically a joke to the rest of the computing world.

Though I agree, in principal at least, some past attempts at requiring open source had lead to various &quot;source available&quot; licenses that are still proprietary. It can be an easy way for them to keep their foothold where needed, and mostly defeats the purpose of the open source requirement.

Not true. All the problems solved are not unique to the MS island and solutions exist outside of that. Unless by &quot;unique&quot; you mean the MS logo on things?

Then you can add MLS to the Linux environment on top of permissions to create an even tighter model.

The disadvantage is that it&#39;s quite tricky to set up.

To your first point, the EU has the eIDAS identity regulation and are rolling out self-sovereign identity based digital identity wallets to all citizens this year.

This enables a totally decentralised future of verifiable credential-based authentication and authorisation for services, obviating the need for AD

AD is one thing, that can be done in an isolated environment (isolated from direct influence from Microsoft). Of course there can be software updates that can kill you but sanity checks can always be performed on incoming updates.

Entra is &quot;One Ring To Rule Them All&quot; and combined with Bitlocker it means that Microsoft and the US government has the ability to decapitate your company.

The move away from MS crap. Not for the reason I expected, but still.The fatal mistake that Microsoft made was disable the email of the chief prosecutor at the International Court of Law. At that point, it became blatantly obvious and impossible to ignore that MS will do whatever the US administration wants to its international (and probably national) customers. Not only Microsoft but every US tech company. All their bleating about their European arms being supposedly out of the reach of US government is just bullshit as long as the Cloud Act exists in the US. And that&#39;s why the rest of the world needs to reduce/eliminate their reliance on US technology companies.

Before I write this, I need to say I think Matrix is very impressive, and I&#39;ve seen some amazing stuff built on that platform, even a FOSS Roblox-like application. I&#39;m not criticizing the authors.

Matrix is in many ways a proof of concept that just... falls short. It doesn&#39;t have the features of Teams, it has a very user-unfriendly encryption system that requires storing keys in local files, it&#39;s really not going to work.

Matrix proves the FOSS community can build something like this, but it isn&#39;t what th

Matrix is a protocol. It doesn&#39;t have any user facing &quot;features&quot; just like TCP/IP doesn&#39;t have any. Applications using matrix can have all the features you want, you just need to implement them.

Most users are not very savvy, especially around new software. When you are making software for governments, you get A LOT of users, and Microsoft has made a whole business of educating and brute-forcing people to learn their systems.

I would love to see Teams get replaced, but we need FOSS that has the kind of support / docs / ecosystem to allow your least-common-denominator user to succeed.

Capitalist efficiency is a myth beyond SMEs. From a certain size on upwards, it goes to hell. To be fair, soviet-type manufacturing efficiency is pretty much the same or worse and they also have worse product quality issues in general. But then I look at where Win11 stands now and it is clear that capitalism with monopolies in place can match soviet incompetence easily.

Erm, if the cost of Teams and the associated ecosystem had been spent on OSS solutions, paying programmers directlyWhat is your point? If you had all the money Microsoft spent on Teams you could build an open source version of Teams? Really? Do you not see the stupidity of that statement?bypassing corporate costs like managers, stockholders, fancy real-estate, glitzy functions in golden ballrooms for &#39;charity&#39; and all the things the entitled corporate hegemony demand in exchange for their &#39;skills&#39;, instead?Well thank you for your kitchen-sink rant... So, out of curiosity, where would someone come up with &quot;the cost of (money spent on) Teams and the associated ecosystem&quot; to develop the FOSS version of Teams and not have to either recoup the investment or (perish the thought) make a profit?

People use MS only because everyone else is using MS. That reduces training when one goes into a new org, and there are zillions of MS how-to videos because it&#39;s ubiquitous. It would take a while for a competitor to gain similar.

Whatever the EU Commission is going to use will have contributions integrated upstream and there will be commercial support from many vendors. European IT is in no way inferior, people are just lazy and stick to what they know unless there are very good reasons not to. These very good reasons have manifested now.

You may have overlooked that in Europe, both the overall administration and member states sponsor FOSS projects. You may also have overlooked that there are quite a few businesses maintaining and developing FOSS in Europe. The European Commission can get whatever is missing developed for them and make that FOSS as well. And they probably will and then anybody can use it.

Incidentally, I used a teaching video conference platform from an EU project some 20 years ago. The only thing was that it needed more band

If they are looking for a chat app, then they may have success.If they are looking for an integrated app in corporate groupware then they will fail miserably. As long as they don&#39;t side by side compare features such as Sharepoint integration, Outlook integration, the selection of commercially available meeting room hardware, etc. they may stand a chance, otherwise Teams offers a feature set that has no comparison with anything else.

God knows it needs it, no one uses that god awful piece of shit software for

Indeed. This is not hard to do and countless examples to be used as inspiration exists.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a lack of expertise that&#39;s the point.The EU of course has ample technological resources.

The problems are the incessant bureaucrats. The EU is suffused with and mired in endless bureaucracy.

The obstacle to replacing Microsoft will not be the code, it will be the necessity of ensuring every country gets their participation, gets their say, that every special interest gets served, that everyone has a piece of whatever is created.

Matrix can do everything Zoom can do, and do it better, and without the security holes.And it is already open source.  Free software, even.

Imagine you attend a protest, like hundreds of thousands of Americans have since President Donald Trump began his second term. Perhaps it is a No Kings event, or a local ICE demonstration to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants in your community. During the protest, you take a video of yourself and your fellow protesters, caption it “Abolish ICE,” and upload it to Instagram. A few weeks later, there’s a knock on your door. Federal agents stand before you, demanding to question you.

You’re wondering to yourself: Do they know about the protest I attended? Are they legally allowed to track me? Do I have to comply?

The answer to these first two questions is, shockingly, yes, and it’s made possible in part by a little-known power that the Trump administration has supercharged in recent months. The answer to the last question is much more complicated. The Department of Homeland Security is one of a number of federal agencies with something called administrative subpoena power, and it has been leveraging that tool in unprecedented ways under Trump 2.0. The Washington Post detailed these abuses this week, focusing on the story of a U.S. citizen targeted by DHS for simply emailing a federal prosecutor his opinion about the federal government’s case against an Afghan national facing deportation.

How can something like this happen? Congress has granted administrative subpoena power to federal agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to allow them to access information quickly to make decisions about issues under their purview. A key distinction between administrative subpoenas and civil or criminal ones is that federal agencies do not need a judge’s sign-off. These agencies retain the power to approve administrative subpoenas themselves. This also means that agencies can demand documents without needing to prove that there is an ongoing investigation into or probable cause against a person when issuing administrative subpoenas.

Federal agencies are not legally required to disclose how many administrative subpoenas they issue, but under the Trump administration, unnamed sources told the Post, the volume of administrative subpoenas is “well into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.” Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, authored a study on the immigration subpoena power and found, through publicly available regulations and internal records, that ICE has empowered its employees—even those focused on civil immigration enforcement—“to demand records and testimony from any person or entity in order to obtain information for any civil or criminal investigation within the agency’s broad domain.”

“At present, there is generally no requirement that officers have probable cause, identify the suspected violation, or exercise restraint,” Nash wrote. This is being exemplified with abuses like the one documented in the Post story, plus footage of federal agents taking pictures of protesters and threatening to add them to “a nice little database,” which some anonymous national security officials claim does in fact exist as a way for DHS and the FBI to track people labeled as “domestic terrorists.” (DHS publicly denies that there is such a database.)

The Trump administration’s heavy use of administrative subpoenas comes as the judiciary—including Republican-appointed judges—has been turning against its immigration enforcement tactics. Just this week, a court blocked the White House from ending temporary protected status for over 350,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., while the chief judge of the District of Minnesota concluded that ICE has most likely violated more court orders in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Administrative subpoenas are a convenient work-around for an administration that knows it faces an uphill battle if it takes its information requests to a judge, a process that requires a formal investigation. Instead of having to meet a strict legal standard, DHS can issue administrative subpoenas to private individuals, tech companies, schools, state governments, and other entities in order to access information about people it’s interested in targeting. It has already tried to take this path to acquire data on folks who track ICE in their local communities. Generally, targeted organizations do not have to notify individuals that their information is being sought by the federal government. However, these groups are not actually obliged to comply with these subpoenas absent judicial action. As Michelle Lapointe, legal director at American Immigration Council, told Slate, administrative subpoenas are not self-enforcing. “When people receive an administrative subpoena from ICE, technically they don’t have to respond,” she said. “The agency can go to court and seek the records to be compelled from the individual who is served with the subpoena. But it has to do that extra step to make it enforceable.”

Lapointe noted that oftentimes recipients of these subpoenas do end up complying out of fear, which DHS appears to be manipulating. The Post story, for instance, described what happened to the U.S. citizen who had emailed the federal prosecutor: Federal agents showed up at his doorstep after he failed to comply with an administrative subpoena. The agents questioned him about the email, asking how he had found the attorney’s email address—through a basic Google search. After about 20 minutes, the agents left.

Critically, tech companies, including Google and Meta, have received administration subpoenas since Trump took office last year, but it’s not always clear when they comply. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that it pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, while spokespeople for Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Snap told the Post their companies alert users about administrative subpoena requests unless they are barred from doing so or face extenuating circumstances.

In a case about six separate Instagram accounts that named and shamed a Border Patrol agent who was part of the Los Angeles immigration raids last summer, DHS sent Meta an administrative subpoena asking for the accounts’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers. In that instance, the Instagram account users were made aware of the subpoena, and a judge ordered Meta not to comply.

The issue here is that Americans are left to simply hope these tech companies operate in good faith and out of the goodness of their hearts, something that “should be alarming to all of us,” Lapointe noted. The threat remains that these companies may end up complying with DHS requests in order to get the administration off their backs, even when subpoenas are unwarranted. “I do think the acquiescence of tech and government makes it especially difficult as a functional matter to protect individual rights when you have administrative subpoena authority,” Dennis Fan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Attending a protest is a constitutionally protected right, as is writing an email that contains your political opinions, but the Trump administration is finding ways to use these actions against its citizens by leaning into third parties—aka Big Tech—who have access to your personal, identifying information. These are companies that have positioned themselves as friendly partners of the White House, given that many of the country’s tech billionaires personally donated to Trump’s inauguration, then were conspicuously seated in the front row.

Where does that leave the average American? The answer is complicated. Lapointe believes that the best thing we can do is remain aware of our constitutional rights and not let Big Tech get away with selling out Americans without a fight. “I think pressure can be brought to bear, the more we raise awareness that these requests could come through and that the tech companies might receive them, requesting your information,” Lapointe said. “Using public pressure campaigns to encourage them to resist these attempts to get at private information could be helpful.”

So if you exercise your First Amendment right to protest injustices you believe your government is committing, you risk being targeted by that very government. And if you don’t want Big Tech helping that government target you? You may have to be right back at that protest again.

In his most recent rant about how Democrats cheat to win elections, President Donald Trump offered a chilling recommendation on Monday. Appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, his former deputy FBI director, the president argued that “the Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places.

“The Republicans,” he added, “ought to nationalize the voting.”

A federal-government takeover of America’s locally and state-administered voting process has long been something Republicans have opposed on principle. But then again, Trump said he wanted to do it. So how would Senate Republicans respond?

There were those who, in a ritual dating back to the early days of Trump’s first term, had conveniently not kept abreast of the news. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told me he wouldn’t comment because he hadn’t seen the interview. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought about it for a few seconds before determining that he too was unfamiliar.

Others were more forthcoming, with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski rejecting the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, most importantly, said, “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections—I mean, I think that’s a constitutional issue.”

But a broad middle of GOP senators took something of a third way: While they wouldn’t endorse a partisan and national takeover of voting itself, they were eager to talk about legislation that would greatly expand the federal role in elections—and do so in a way that furthers a long-standing partisan goal of the GOP.

“We need to safeguard our elections better,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me. “I think the SAVE Act is a great start. I think requiring proof of citizenship when you register to vote is a must.”

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that “we shouldn’t nationalize” elections, “but we should certainly set certain standards like citizenship and voter ID.” He added, “The problem is, we have Democrats who want to make it easy to cheat.”

Florida Sen. Rick Scott echoed those sentiments. “We need to have voter ID in our elections. We need to make sure illegal aliens cannot vote in our elections,” he said. “We need to make sure that we just stop the fraud.”

As Marshall alluded to, the bill that Republicans have coalesced around is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which the House passed earlier this Congress, and which proponents are trying to find some magical way to squeeze through the Senate’s brick wall.

Even White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a Tuesday press briefing, said passage of this legislation is what Trump had been referring to when he called to “nationalize the voting.” Sure it was.

Republicans often point to the high public support for requiring photo ID at polling places. The SAVE Act is more than that, though. It requires “documentary proof of United States citizenship” in order to register to vote. Such proof means things like a passport or a birth certificate. REAL IDs could count too, but only if they indicate citizenship, and just a handful of states’ REAL IDs currently do so. The SAVE Act, in other words, applies drastic changes to solve a problem—voter fraud—that is vanishingly rare, though it would succeed in creating hurdles for eligible voters. It goes without saying that Democrats have no interest in this legislation, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has described it as “nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0.”

Given Senate Democrats’ 100 percent chance of filibustering this legislation, and Republicans’ inability to eliminate the legislative filibuster, then, what’s the plan for getting this bill through the Senate?

House Republicans think they have an idea that could work. Bless their hearts.

After the Senate and White House reached a deal last week to extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding for only two weeks, giving them a brief window to negotiate new immigration enforcement reforms, conservative House Republicans were displeased. If Democrats felt as if they could reopen a closed negotiation over DHS funding, then they wanted to participate too. A group of them, led by Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, insisted that when the Senate deal returned to the House, they wouldn’t support it unless they could attach the SAVE Act.

But such a move would have been a recipe for a prolonged shutdown. Trump’s priority over the past week has been to avoid a lengthy shutdown that keeps the issue of immigration enforcement tactics front and center in the news. And so, following a White House meeting, Luna and Co. said they’d received “assurances” from Thune that they would wait out a “standing filibuster” from their Democratic counterparts in order to pass the SAVE Act, at a later date. In return, the rebels would support the government funding bill sent over from the Senate.

Anyone familiar with the Senate realizes that Thune would never have made such an assurance. As Thune clarified Tuesday morning, all he said was that he’d have a conversation with Republican senators about it. You have to know what waiting out a “standing filibuster” means—and most House members don’t—to understand why he wouldn’t promise it to some aggravated House members.

Waiting out a “standing,” or “talking,” filibuster means you wait for the other side to stop talking before moving ahead to a simple-majority vote, as opposed to the normal means of cutting off debate: invoking cloture with 60 votes. The strategy, if used, would likely involve enforcing the Senate’s two-speech rule, barring lawmakers from speaking more than twice in the same legislative day on the same question.

The problem is that this can take forever. Forty-seven Democratic senators being able to speak twice, on its own terms, could take up weeks or months of precious legislative floor time that Republicans need for other priorities. And that’s before any amendments that could reset the clock. Plus, GOP senators would need to be on or near the floor for the entirety of this time to ensure they have a quorum lest Democratic speakers attempt a quorum call.

“I’m skeptical that it’s going to be a panacea,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a onetime member of leadership who’s well familiar with Senate rules, told me.

Thune laid out all of these challenges Tuesday afternoon but nevertheless promised to “have a discussion about it and see where our conference is.” In other words, the plan is to allow the passage of time to do the humble work of making everyone forget about all of this.

Trump’s desire for greater control over the administration of the midterm elections, however, won’t disappear amid congressional gridlock. The president already initiated a national redistricting war to squeeze out a few more congressional seats. The FBI has already raided a Georgia election facility and could plan for more. The Justice Department keeps trying to get its mitts on state voter rolls. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but if there’s a way to do “nationalization” by other means, the administration will be looking into it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An enterprising engineer has evoked the spirit of Acorn&#39;s BBC Micro with a custom paintjob for a Raspberry Pi 500+ computer-in-a-keyboard and a natty set of replacement keycaps.

You&#39;ve got a shiny new Raspberry Pi 500+. You&#39;ve marveled at the colored lights on the keyboard, enjoyed the snappy performance of the SSD, and appreciated the 16 GB of RAM. Hopefully, you bought it before the prices went up. But what to do next?

Raspberry Pi 500+ painted beige with BBC Micro-like keys (pic: Raspberry Pi) - Click to enlarge

According to Tony Roberts, who goes by the title of &#39;Maker In Residence at Raspberry Pi&#39;, he wanted to make the device look a bit like the BBC Microcomputer that inspired the company&#39;s co-founder, Eben Upton.

BBC Micro emulators are nothing new (alongside emulators for other computers of the same era), and several enthusiasts have breathed new life into defunct devices by removing the long-dead internals and replacing them with a Pi or similar device. This writer attempted something akin with an old Texas Instruments 99/4a, but was defeated by a combination of making the keyboard talk to the Pi via an Arduino and some catastrophically bad soldering.

However, since the Pi 500+ is already a computer-in-a-keyboard, and the keys can be easily replaced (to the point where a tool is included to pry them off), Roberts&#39; approach was to give the computer a beige facelift and replace the keycaps with ones that resembled Acorn&#39;s finest.

In a post on the company&#39;s website, Roberts wrote, &quot;Within minutes of starting the makeover, I discovered that beige spray paint is unsurprisingly not very popular anymore — especially this exact shade, which reminds me of nicotine-stained pub wallpaper.&quot;

But, after dismantling the case (the Pi 500+ is designed to be taken apart), Roberts applied primer, a top coat, and had a base that, from a distance and with a bit of squinting, was roughly the same shade as the computers sat at the back of school classrooms all those decades ago.

The keycaps came from Signature Plastics, but since the Pi 500+ uses a standard keycap, there are plenty of options out there. Roberts selected one that comes remarkably close to the color and style of the original. However, we suspect a bit of software keymapping in the operating system is needed for some of them.

Considering the sheer number of computer-in-a-keyboard machines from the heyday of home computers, Roberts has demonstrated how easy it is to pull off a keyboard switcheroo and use a can of paint to evoke a strong sense of nostalgia (or is it just the paint fumes?). Sure, it&#39;s a $260 investment (thanks to rising memory prices), but it&#39;s also a neat way of showing off an IT origin story.

There&#39;s no word on whether Raspberry Pi might put out a limited-edition run of Roberts&#39; creation to mark its own origin story. In the meantime, a bit of brushed metal and some Texas Instruments 99/4a keycaps would do nicely... ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A British supermarket says staff will undergo further training after a store manager ejected the wrong man when facial recognition technology triggered an alert.

Warren Rajah was approached by a store manager at Sainsbury&#39;s in London&#39;s Elephant and Castle and instructed to leave after the store&#39;s Facewatch system alerted staff to a match.

Sainsbury&#39;s told The Register that its Facewatch system correctly identified a man on its offenders&#39; database, and alerted store managers who manually review each flag. However, in responding to the alert, the manager approached the wrong person, Rajah, and escorted him out of the store.

A Sainsbury&#39;s spokesperson said: &quot;We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.&quot;

Facewatch technology is currently operating in six Sainsbury&#39;s stores in the UK, five of which are in Greater London.

The facial recognition tech was first trialled in September 2025 in Sydenham and Bath Oldfield Park, before being rolled out to Dalston, Elephant and Castle, Ladbroke Grove, Camden, and Whitechapel earlier this year.

The technology has a reported 99.98 percent accuracy rate, we&#39;re told, and has led to a 46 percent reduction in logged incidents of theft, harm, aggression, and antisocial behavior.

The majority of offenders (92 percent) do not return to stores with Facewatch running, and this is the first time a store manager has misidentified a customer after the system issued a alert.

Rajah, who works in sales at tech reseller CDW, told the BBC: &quot;Am I supposed to walk around fearful that I might be misidentified as a criminal?

&quot;Imagine how mentally debilitating this could be to someone vulnerable, after that kind of public humiliation.&quot;

He reported being approached by three store managers holding smartphones. They looked at the phone, then at him, and told him to leave the store, pointing to posters near the entrance informing shoppers that facial recognition tech was in operation.

Rajah had to submit a copy of his passport and head shot to Facewatch so the company could verify he was not on the offenders&#39; database.

A Facewatch spokesperson said: &quot;We&#39;re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah&#39;s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in-store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.

&quot;Our data protection team followed the usual lawfully required process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.&quot;

Facewatch is currently rolled out across other retailers in the UK including B&M, Budgens, Costcutter, Southern Co-op, Spar, and Sports Direct.

Other supermarkets such as Iceland began trialing the tech last year.

Digital rights group Big Brother Watch branded the frozen food purveyor&#39;s trial &quot;Orwellian&quot; and &quot;dystopian,&quot; and said the company&#39;s technology also led to the ejection of a woman in a Home Bargains store after she was wrongfully accused of theft.

Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said at the time: &quot;Iceland&#39;s decision to deploy dystopian facial recognition technology to monitor its customers is disproportionate and chilling.

&quot;Thousands of people will have their privacy rights violated just to buy basic necessities, and Iceland will turn its shoppers into suspects, making them submit to a biometric identity check as part of their daily lives.&quot;

Big Brother Watch is campaigning against the use of live facial recognition in the UK, especially by London&#39;s Metropolitan Police.

Jasleen Chaggar, Legal & Policy Officer at Big Brother Watch, said: &quot;The idea that we are all just one facial recognition mistake away from being falsely accused of a crime or ejected from a store without any explanation is deeply chilling.

&quot;To add insult to injury, innocent people seeking remedy must jump through hoops and hand over even more personal data just to discover what they’re accused of. In the vast majority of cases, they are offered little more than an apology when companies are finally forced to admit the tech got it wrong.

&quot;This isn&#39;t an isolated incident – Big Brother Watch regularly hears from members of the public who are left traumatised after being wrongly caught in this net of privatised biometric surveillance.

&quot;The government&#39;s promise to regulate this invasive technology will be payment to lip service unless it reins in the unchecked expansion of facial recognition by retailers.&quot;

Big Brother Watch is currently spearheading a legal challenge against the technology, arguing that it is incompatible with human rights laws. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has laid out a timeline for the disablement and shutdown of Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online.

October 1, 2026, is when EWS will be disabled by default, although tenants can keep the lights on a little longer by setting the EWSEnabled flag to true by August, but the service will be shut down entirely on April 1, 2027.

EWS has long been deprecated, and Microsoft announced its retirement in 2023. The noose tightened in 2025, with confirmation that certain license types (F1 or F2) would be blocked from using it.

The service is an API that allows applications to access mailboxes and data stores in Exchange Online and Exchange Server. It dates back to Exchange Server 2007, and has proven popular with integrators and third parties (as well as in-house applications such as Outlook Classic). It is also popular with miscreants. Following the Midnight Blizzard security incident, Microsoft &quot;elevated the urgency&quot; of pushing the tech out to pasture.

The retirement only applies to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online. Nothing will change regarding EWS in Exchange Server.

The timeline means affected administrators who have not yet begun or completed a migration will need to get moving. Microsoft&#39;s preference is a move to Microsoft Graph. However, it noted the service is just at &quot;near-complete&quot; feature parity and even Microsoft itself had yet to conclude the migration of all its impacted applications.

To focus minds, Microsoft also said it &quot;may perform temporary &#39;scream tests&#39;&quot; where it turns EWS off and on to expose hidden dependencies. It did not disclose how an administrator would differentiate a &quot;scream test&quot; from one of the depressingly regular outages that plague its online services. Was it deliberate, or did someone screw up a configuration file again?

Microsoft said: &quot;We will provide more information in the coming weeks.&quot;

For administrators hoping Microsoft might blink and allow the service to run past the termination date, it said: &quot;There will be no exceptions past April 2027.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">America&#39;s federal agencies have been told to hunt down and rip out aging firewalls, routers, and other network gatekeepers before attackers use them as skeleton keys into government systems.

CISA has issued a Binding Operational Directive that orders federal civilian executive branch agencies to inventory and replace &quot;end-of-support&quot; edge devices – hardware and software that vendors no longer patch or maintain – in a bid to close one of government IT&#39;s most persistent intrusion paths.

The directive, published this week, requires agencies to immediately update still-supported equipment and, within three months, produce a comprehensive inventory of edge devices to identify those past vendor support deadlines. Anything that&#39;s fallen off the vendor support cliff has to be booted off government networks and replaced with kit that still gets security fixes. Agencies have about a year to finish the hardware spring clean, and two years to put tracking in place so they don&#39;t end up quietly running abandonware again.

CISA is acting after years of watching obsolete edge hardware morph into reliable break-in tools. Firewalls, VPN gateways, routers, and other outward-facing security gear sit right on the network&#39;s front line, and when one is compromised, it can open a surprisingly short path to everything behind it.

When vendors stop issuing patches, newly discovered flaws remain permanently exposed, turning those devices into what CISA calls a &quot;substantial and constant&quot; risk to federal networks.

Acting CISA boss Madhu Gottumukkala said unsupported devices have no business staying plugged into enterprise networks, pitching the directive as part of a wider push to toughen up federal systems against the steady drumbeat of cyber campaigns targeting both government and industry.

To help agencies comply, CISA plans to publish and maintain a list of edge devices that have reached or are nearing the end of support. The directive was developed alongside the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and effectively adds enforcement muscle to long-standing federal policy requiring agencies to phase out unsupported technologies as quickly as possible.

The directive may be labeled binding, but it doesn&#39;t come with financial smackdowns or handcuffs. CISA monitors progress with help from OMB, banking on the fact that agencies usually treat these mandates as something closer to law than guidance.

The agency is also urging state, local, and private-sector organizations to adopt similar cleanup efforts, even though the directive formally applies only to federal civilian systems.

The order lands amid a broader recognition that attackers increasingly target infrastructure rather than endpoints, exploiting network gear that may run quietly for years without attention. The directive makes clear that swapping out old hardware is now part of the security playbook, not just a line item buried in procurement.  ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than 30 Romanian railway employees accused of running a bribery and ticket resale racket allegedly tried to crowdsource their legal strategy from ChatGPT.

Prosecutors in Bucharest have sent 33 staff from Romania&#39;s state rail operator CFR Călători to trial over claims they manipulated booking systems to lock sleeper and couchette seats, then quietly sold them off-the-books to passengers willing to pay cash.

According to local news outlet Club Feroviar, investigators say the workers used the personal data of students eligible for free rail travel to reserve seats that could later be flipped for profit.

The eyebrow-raising detail in the corruption probe is that once investigators began circling, court filings cited in Romanian press reports suggest that at least two of the accused individuals consulted ChatGPT to ask whether their alleged actions constituted financial harm.

Excerpts from conversations described as between an employee and the AI show questions focused less on innocence and more on legal technicalities. In one exchange, the worker allegedly asked: &quot;Who establishes the financial damage if the injured party does not want compensation?&quot; Another scenario reportedly posed to the chatbot questioned: &quot;Does blocking seats in the reservation system represent damage if no financial loss can be proven?&quot;

The exchanges also hint at mounting anxiety as investigators closed in. In one reported message, the user allegedly asked: &quot;Why do the police call everyone to work and not to the police?&quot; – a line that appears to reference internal workplace questioning rather than a formal summons. In another, they reportedly acknowledged investigators&#39; awareness of specific activity, writing: &quot;They already know that I, for example, blocked 17 places in the system.&quot;

The AI&#39;s replies, according to the published excerpts, focused on general legal theory rather than anything jurisdiction-specific. The chatbot reportedly explained: &quot;If the damage concerns a private individual or company, they usually have to request compensation... If the damage concerns the state or a public institution, authorities may intervene even without a complaint.&quot;

It also outlined hypothetical scenarios suggesting that financial damage could be difficult to prove depending on circumstances, noting that &quot;if no measurable loss is demonstrated, the existence of damage can be disputed.&quot;

At one point, the chatbot allegedly offered to help draft a defense statement, writing: &quot;Do you want me to draft a complete template of a written statement personalized for your situation, in which you acknowledge the blocking of places, but protect yourself legally as much as possible? I can do that right away.&quot;

Romanian prosecutors appear unimpressed. Authorities compiled a case file of more than 700 pages following searches and evidence-gathering related to suspected bribery, abuse of office, and fraudulent ticketing practices dating back at least a year.

There is no suggestion ChatGPT played any role in the alleged crimes themselves – the reported conversations underline a growing trend of some people treating generative AI as a pocket legal explainer, sometimes with questionable results. Tools like ChatGPT can summarize general legal concepts, but are notorious for lacking jurisdiction-specific nuance and have a well-documented habit of sounding confident even when missing critical context.

For the Romanian rail staff now heading to court, their legal strategy may have just arrived at the wrong platform. ®

            <div id="article-text">NASA&#39;s Administrator has stated that smartphones will accompany the Crew-12 and Artemis II astronauts on their missions.

Jared Isaacman posted on X (formerly Twitter): &quot;We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world.&quot;

He added: &quot;We challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline.&quot;

Isaacman did not elaborate on how those long-standing processes had been challenged. It certainly isn&#39;t the first time smartphones have been flown in space, and astronauts regularly use tablets for following procedures and other tasks.

Taking a device into space has traditionally required it to be thoroughly tested beforehand. For example, there is the question of outgassing and how the device might interfere with other equipment. One space agency source directed The Register to the MIL-STD-461 standard for electromagnetic equipment, saying: &quot;Normally they nerf all the RF capabilities, so they just become a pocket computer.&quot;

It&#39;s not clear what has happened with the &quot;latest smartphones&quot; (widely reported to be iPhones) Isaacman mentioned. The Register asked NASA, and will update this piece should the agency respond.

Potential interference from the device&#39;s GSM radio is likely the most significant concern, although our source said: &quot;They [the crew] won&#39;t be calling on them.&quot; Other consumer-grade devices, such as the Raspberry Pi computers used in the AstroPi project, eschew wireless connectivity altogether.

Smartphones have been on the ISS before. In 2015, the European Space Agency (ESA) showcased the mobiPV system, a cross-platform platform that allowed astronauts to access procedure lists on the go. One device type was a wrist-mounted smartphone.

Isaacman&#39;s real thrust is to challenge NASA&#39;s often long-winded processes and identify room for improvement. Taking advantage of a modern smartphone camera rather than something older and heftier is an easy win. For example, the Nikon Z9 camera planned for Artemis III will be almost a decade old by the time the mission launches, and technology will have advanced in the intervening years. ®

I’m willing to bet you’ve been served an ad for Athletic Greens — also known as AG1. It’s impossible to escape them in podcasts, and it seems like almost every wellness influencer on every social media platform has done an ad for them at some point.

AG1 is a greens powder containing over 70 ingredients. Most of it is freeze-dried vegetable powder blends. Basically, instead of taking a multivitamin or eating an actual vegetable, greens powders like AG1 claim to be a more convenient way to make sure you’re getting all your essential nutrients. The proposed benefits are better energy levels, gut health, digestion, focus, and immunity. You know, things that pesky dieticians say will come from eating a balanced diet.

I take AG1 first thing in the morning before work. I feel so much healthier and better in my body, say yoga-set-wearing influencers, holding up a glass of murky green liquid. In recent ads, actor Hugh Jackman tap dances, annoying his downstairs neighbors, because the “quality vitamins, probiotics, and superfoods” in AG1 give him boundless energy. He must drink it every morning if he’s to do eight shows on Broadway a week, Jackman says with a toothy, affable smile.

Wolverine isn’t the only one getting a boost. AG1 announced in a football-themed ad that it’s “endorsing” three student health researchers.

“At AG1, we believe that when you’re clinically backed, you should back research that moves science forward,” a baritone-voiced announcer intones, over footage of young academics posing on the 50-yard line.

None of the other smart, science-sounding words hit quite as hard as “clinically backed.” In the wellness wild west, you’ll see that descriptor plastered across a sea of marketing materials and falling awkwardly from the mouths of celebrity spokespersons. The implication is simple: Unlike the snake oil salesmen, we care about science. We do the research. We are trustworthy.

But what does “clinically backed” actually mean?

Scrolling through AG1 videos on TikTok, I see some skeptical dieticians and health professionals. Taking AG1, they say, will just result in expensive pee. Even so, the general consensus is that while AG1 might be pricey and multivitamins aren’t necessary for most healthy people, they do conduct a lot of research.

What kind of research? To find out, I hopped on over to AG1’s Research Studies webpage. I am greeted by giant text that reads, “The next generation of AG1 is clinically backed.” In the accompanying blurb, there are words like “research” and “clinical discovery.” Any claims, it reads, are “substantiated by multiple bodies of research on ingredients and the finished formula.” I’m told that the impact of AG1 Next Gen is measurable. Next to this lofty blurb, a hand holds out a petri dish-like disc with a small mound of green powder in the middle.

Throughout this page you see wellness buzzwords like “biomarkers,” “bioavailability,” “microbiome.” Every so often, “clinically” is sprinkled in for good measure. There are little explainer blocks with even more science-sounding phrases like “randomized, placebo-controlled trials” and “gold standard.” Charts and graphs accompany each section. I’m shown professional headshots of the research team, many of whom have “Dr.” in front of their names and an impressive-seeming jumble of letters after, denoting their various bona fides. There are more headshots of science and innovation advisers.

After scrolling for what feels like an eternity, I arrive at a section titled “peer-reviewed research” that lists each published study, a brief descriptor, and a link.

If I were the average consumer, I would not get this far down the page. If I did, this would look pretty legit. As a health tech reviewer, there are several red flags before I even click on a single study link.

A classic wellness marketing strategy is to stick a viral marketing label next to actual scientific terms or concepts with research behind them. In this case, a marketing label like “superfood” can live comfortably next to terms like “probiotics” and “microbiome.” The former just means “nutrient-dense food.” The latter two refer to a type of living bacteria and the ecosystem of microbes that live in your intestines. Add the word “clinical” and sleek packaging, and it’s easy to convince everyone your product isn’t just a supplement. It’s scientifically proven, and therefore, trustworthy.

But what is the point of clinical studies for a supplement? Clinical trials are a must for drugs and medical treatments, but aren’t required of supplements, as they’re not overseen by the Food and Drug Administration. Scroll down far enough on AG1’s site, and you’ll find this disclaimer:

These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. Information on this site is provided for informational purposes only.

“The term ‘clinically tested’ is context-dependent and may represent a wide range of evidence quality. In the vitamins and dietary supplements market, it is frequently used as a marketing term rather than a standardized scientific designation,” says Dr. Julia Adamian, an internal medicine specialist at NYU Langone Health.

“In some cases, ‘clinically tested’ may even be based on customer reviews or limited observational data. As we know, this is not the most reliable form of evidence, especially when incentives are offered for positive feedback.”

To evaluate a clinical study’s trustworthiness, Adamian pointed me to a few criteria:

That’s an excellent start. In science reporting, we also have a few other criteria, like examining sample size and reviewing methodology. Sure, AG1’s site provides summaries, but if you really want to vet a wellness company’s trustworthiness, it’s a good idea to review the results yourself.

Of the peer-reviewed journals listed on its site, AG1 lists Nutrients, Microorganisms, Current Issues in Microbiology, Journal of Functional Foods, Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, and Frontiers. These are, in fact, peer-reviewed journals and not white papers. (Wellness companies sometimes try to pass off internal research, or white papers, as peer-reviewed, which means other scientists review the work itself.) That said, not all peer-reviewed journals are viewed equally. Frontiers, for example, has many offshoots and a mixed reputation among academics after it had to retract 122 articles in 2025 for unethical actions like improperly disclosing conflicts of interest.

On that topic: Of the non-paywalled studies — the average consumer likely wouldn’t subscribe to a science journal — all were funded by AG1, and several authors were also AG1 employees. That’s common in wellness, but it means these aren’t truly independent studies.

As for outcomes, the published studies had fairly clear abstracts and were pretty honest in their findings. I say they were honest because in several instances, the results showed there was little to no impact of taking AG1.

In one study designed to measure the impact on the gut microbiome, researchers found taking AG1 increased the amount of two probiotic strains… because they were ingredients in AG1. This, they concluded, meant the probiotics reached the intestines. This study also found no negative change to bowel movements. Meaning, if you were hoping this would help you poop better, this study is wholly inconclusive. That’s partly because this study had a small sample size of 30 healthy adults. Anyone suffering from digestive issues was also excluded from the study, likely to reduce variables. That means if you do suffer from gastrointestinal problems, these results also may not apply to you.

In summary, AG1’s published studies boiled down to this: It likely won’t hurt you to take AG1. It just likely won’t change your life either.

But there’s a catch. The published studies are for the original formulation of AG1. The fancy graphs and charts at the top of the page? They refer to data from new, unpublished studies for AG1 Next Gen — a reformulated version of AG1 that you can currently buy on the site.

The only reviewable information for the new “clinically backed” AG1 Next Gen are brief summaries that were presented at conferences last year and footnotes at the very bottom of the website. Not every summary disclosed funding, but the ones that did confirmed AG1 paid for those studies. In a collapsible menu that’s easy to scroll past, AG1 says it may take years to fully publish everything in a peer-reviewed journal.

When I dove down the AG1 rabbit hole, the goal was to examine how truthful its product marketing was. Wellness branding often slips into science-washing — and that can be incredibly hard for the average person to spot in the age of influencer marketing. AG1 has a well-crafted, slick marketing page. Its ads tell a coherent story that’s founded upon decades of wellness and supplement trends. And, considering that doing any research for a supplement isn’t required, AG1 is spending a lot of money to document that its product does what you’d think a freeze-dried spinach powder does.

But calling it “clinically backed” isn’t the endorsement most people think it is. If I were to grade AG1’s trustworthiness, I’d simply say: This product is sus.

On The Vergecast: The Epstein files, Anthropic’s Super Bowl ads, pirates are back, and more.

There are bold-faced tech names all over the Epstein files. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt, Larry Page, Reid Hoffman, Steven Sinofsky, Peter Thiel, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, on and on and on. These men (and they’re pretty much all men) had wildly varying degrees of interaction with Epstein, and the details matter a great deal. But so does the totality of it: you spend long enough in these files, and you start to get a sense of the way the world works for a particular kind of extremely rich and extremely powerful businessman. And it starts to feel pretty bad.

Verge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Vergecast wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here.

On this episode of The Vergecast, David and Nilay start the show by talking about the latest tranche of emails from the Epstein files, both what we’ve learned and the deeply strange way in which they’re being disseminated. There are interesting business stories in here; there are shocking plots to change the world. We’re still not sure how to talk about any of it, except to keep showing what we find.

After that, it’s time for the other thing capturing tech minds this week: Anthropic’s Super Bowl ads, which isn’t explicitly a shot at OpenAI’s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT but is also very clearly exactly that. The ads started a debate about both how we use AI and how we pay for it and also made it a little clearer how precarious OpenAI’s position is right now. They’re also just very good ads.

Then it’s time for some streaming talk, including the utterly bizarre conversation about Netflix’s supposed wokeness and the hit new streaming box you can buy at a farmers market. Finally, in the lightning round, we do a round of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, celebrate Google Home’s button support, and wonder when we’ll ever be able to buy gadgets again.

            <div id="article-text">Geely may build cars in the US, but their software still has to follow cybersecurity restrictions.

Geely may build cars in the US, but their software still has to follow cybersecurity restrictions.

Is the long freeze on Chinese automakers selling cars in the US finally starting to thaw? China is the largest auto market in the world and now the largest car exporter, too. But high tariffs and geopolitical tensions have kept Chinese automakers away from US customers. Many of those cars are ready for primetime and are fully competitive with current offerings in the United States.

Geely is among those Chinese carmakers that want to sell their cars here. It’s already sailed past one of two hurdles any of them need to clear to do that: Its Volvo Cars division already has an assembly plant in South Carolina that would let it build its cars domestically. That plant now builds the Volvo EX90 electric SUV and the Polestar 3 that shares its platform; it will add the Volvo XC60 late this year.

Few US buyers realize it, but Geely has controlled the Swedish automaker for more than 15 years. Is the Volvo factory a possible foothold for Geely’s future in the US?

The challenge for Geely is that any Chinese company selling cars in the US must certify that all software for autonomous driving, and all hardware and software for connectivity and telematics, has not been developed in or controlled by a “country of concern” (China or Russia). Those strictures sit within a Commerce Department rule that took effect in March 2025; it’s intended to protect the country from hostile use of advanced auto technologies by adversary countries.

Initiated by Joe Biden’s administration, the rule was finalized by Donald Trump’s second administration. The provisions on software take effect next month for cars in model years 2027 and later. The hardware ban follows in three years, starting with model year 2030 cars. The bans sought to avert several types of national security risk.

Is the Volvo factory a possible foothold for Geely’s future in the US?

One goal was to prevent an adversary government from gaining access to the cars via telematics to control their movements — whether taking over the driving remotely or mass-disabling them. Another was to ensure the vehicles could not gather personally identifiable information on people of interest in the US (corporate executives, members of the military, celebrities, and more). The fear is that the vehicles could record voice and facial recognition data, their travel patterns, their contacts, their phone calls, and much more — all of which could be used to train artificial intelligence programs. A final goal, broadly, was to prevent vehicles produced by makers in those countries from capturing detailed images and data on US roads and the built environment through which the cars traveled.

Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry, takes a more jaundiced view of this risk. The actions it guards against are “a very inefficient way of spying,” he said, as compared to spy satellites, mobile-phone data, and commercial map data. For all the risks cited, he suggested Americans should be far more concerned about the “data being gathered by Flock and Palantir than anything Chinese cars might send to Beijing.”

Avery Ash, CEO of Securing America’s Future Energy, or SAFE, emphasized the rules were established solely for reasons of national security, and are not concerned with national economic competitiveness. SAFE is a nonprofit think tank that advocates and lobbies for policies that reduce the US dependence on oil; it sees connected, autonomous EVs as an important pathway toward that goal. Data storage locations and governance remain concerns, Ash said, so the rules take a very broad look at what constitutes “control” by a Chinese entity. Where the software was designed is irrelevant; it’s about effective control of the company that wrote it and the firms that designed the hardware it runs on.

The rules do not “cover Chinese software developed before the new rules took effect, so long as it was not being maintained by a Chinese firm,” according to the Commerce Department. But, Ash noted, any updates to grandfathered software happening after the effective date would fall under the new rules.

The ban on Chinese vehicle software leads inevitably to the question of Volvo. The public face of the company is entirely Swedish, but Geely has controlled 80 to 100 percent of the company since 2010. Sources who attended last year’s hearings on the Commerce rules felt Volvo may be able to find a way to address the department’s concerns. Since it’s seen as a European carmaker and a household name in the US, it will likely be able to continue building and selling cars here.

Indeed, those sources suggested, Volvo is likely already in talks with Commerce about its future vehicle plans, the software in those vehicles, and what it would take to get explicit approvals that certify it adheres to the rules for each model year of every model it sells.

Where the software was designed is irrelevant; it’s about effective control of the company that wrote it and the firms that designed the hardware it runs on.

“Volvo Cars follows government rules in all markets where we operate and is committed to working with US Commerce on the technical aspects of the rule,” company spokesperson Thomas McIntyre Schultz said in a statement. “We are having a productive dialogue with the Department of Commerce which is ongoing.”

To date, Ash said, no waivers to the rules have been issued. Any company that wanted one would have to request a “specific authorization” for vehicles, software, and/or components that would otherwise be barred — and a separate authorization is required for each separate model, for each model year. Companies self-document and self-attest to their compliance, he noted, but the department can review any such claims, request documentation, and test the vehicle. (This is similar to how US vehicle-emissions certification has worked for 50 years.)

But if future Zeekr or Geely models use the same platforms and software as those Volvo will continue to build in the US, the Chinese company may say: We just want to put different sheet metal on the same car that’s already received a waiver, and sell it under another name. That’s what Polestar now does with its 3, largely a Volvo EX90 underneath. Why can’t we do that?

Concern arose last month when it became public that the architect of the policy, Elizabeth Cannon, recently resigned as executive director of the Office of Information and Communications Technology and Services in the Commerce Department. (Reuters reported she was “pushed out” by the Trump administration.) White House spokesperson Kush Desai subsequently told The Atlantic Cannon’s departure “should not be read that deeply into as reflective of broader Administration thinking or decision-making.”

That followed shortly after a new National Defense Strategy on January 23rd that made little mention of China as an adversary. Reversing long-standing US defense policy, the new strategy uses remarkably conciliatory language toward China, focusing on “mutual respect” and “establishing trade.”

One insider echoed Desai’s take, saying no evidence to date has emerged that suggests the current administration intends to ax the Commerce rules. The longer-term concern, that person said, will be whether Commerce will stick to its guns and require “robust, rigorous” review of the software, where it was developed, what entity controls its source code, and where all US data is stored. Will specific authorizations only be issued once those issues have been thoroughly vetted — or will Chinese makers be let off with a “soft review” that leaves some risks open?

No evidence to date has emerged that suggests the current administration intends to ax the Commerce rules.

A recent example of soft review, the source said, was the deal under which a controlling interest in TikTok’s US activities passed to a joint venture in which owner ByteDance retained a stake. While the announcement touted “comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users,” security professionals suggest significant loopholes remain.

Geely has a great deal of work to do before it can sell cars in the US under its own brands, but it remains the Chinese automaker best positioned to build cars in the US. As it stands today, Geely will still need to convince the US government its software isn’t Chinese at all — and was developed by some entity not controlled by a Chinese firm. At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing this week, Waymo officials were grilled over the company’s decision to use a decontented Zeekr RT as its next robotaxi platform, with one Republican senator griping that the Alphabet-owned company’s assurances that the vehicle met all relevant mandates “ridiculous.”

It would take roughly three years to add a new vehicle, from a different brand, to Volvo’s South Carolina factory. Given the fast-moving nature of the current political situation, whether Geely will in fact have to prove its software complies with the Commerce rules during that entire period — for every model, for every model year — remains up to the changing imperatives and whims of the administration.

Meanwhile, Geely’s targets for localized production are hardly limited to the US. While its Volvo unit will have European assembly plants in three countries by the end of the year, Ford and Geely are reportedly in discussions about Geely potentially using excess Ford factory space in Europe to produce vehicles for that market. And the leading autonomous vehicle company in the US, Waymo, is using a decontented Zeekr RT as its next-generation robotaxi.

            <div id="article-text">The emails show the “anti-woke” crusaders are afraid of accountability.

The emails show the “anti-woke” crusaders are afraid of accountability.

He might be dead, but it sure seems like Jeffrey Epstein won.

Sure, Epstein was arrested on charges of sex trafficking minors. Sure, he died in jail. (I am not going to wade into the debate about how.) But he subscribed to a racist, misogynist ideology that meant rich white men like him could do whatever they liked. And it seems he took measures to spread it.

The latest tranche of Epstein documents made it obvious. Consider all the “contrarians” and “anti-woke” warriors who show up in the latest dump: Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Larry Summers, Steve Bannon, and of course, Donald Trump. With apologies to George Carlin: It’s a big club, and the worst people are in it — because their interests are all aligned. Pushing back on social justice, it turns out, was coordinated.

Being able to see their emails makes something very clear: The “anti-woke” movement was not a genteel intellectual inquiry, made by disinterested parties who cared deeply about free speech. It is a social circle of powerful people who feel threatened by #MeToo. Reading through the emails, it’s possible to see that Epstein himself coordinated pushback against #MeToo. Looking back, it seems obvious that sinking #MeToo also led to where we are now: a place where laws simply don’t apply if you have enough money and power. The same players are involved.

How did all these people know each other?

Recall the great many pronouncements about the limits and dangers of #MeToo — hilariously, Bari Weiss wrote an entire article in The New York Times about “iconoclastic” members of the “intellectual dark web” who “talk constantly about the regressive left but far less about the threat from the right.” Included in this group was a correspondent of Epstein’s: Sam Harris, to whom Epstein suggested he use “more charm and less argument” in debates. Several of the names mentioned in the article would later join Weiss’ abortive attempt at an “independent” school, the non-accredited University of Austin. Much like the group Weiss profiles itself, the University of Austin would become a tool of the far right.

It is more accurate to understand the “anti-woke” “iconoclasts” as a group of loosely affiliated people with the same goals. This isn’t an abstract intellectual movement about free speech — or we’d be hearing more from these people about the recent DHS actions to hunt down critics of Epstein’s old friend, Donald Trump. Besides Trump, there are two key ringleaders: Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. They both appear extensively in the Epstein files, and have good reason to want to remain untouchable.

How did all these people know each other? Epstein’s influence campaign started in the sciences in the early 2000s, with the help of John Brockman, a powerhouse literary agent, and his Edge Foundation, to which Epstein was the largest donor. “Foundations associated with Epstein provided $638,000 out of a total of almost $857,000 received by Edge” between 2001 and 2017, without which “the nonprofit’s full range of exclusive events would not have been possible,” according to BuzzFeed News.

“john the old conferencess did not care about diversity I suggest you not either. the women are all weak ,and a distraction sorry, .”

Brockman, who got his start with underground movies and Andy Warhol in the 1960s, wanted Edge “to serve as a forum for big, intriguing and/or disturbing ideas advanced by intellectuals who have a track record of major achievements in their fields,” according to The Guardian. The obvious idea was to influence culture by disseminating those ideas.

The group was, of course, mostly men. The demographics are somewhat explained in the current email dump. In 2018, Epstein wrote to Brockman, “john the old conferencess did not care about diversity I suggest you not either. the women are all weak ,and a distraction sorry, .”

This echoes a long-standing argument — propped up by the likes of Summers and by Steven Pinker, another of Epstein’s close associates, in Edge itself — has been that the lack of women in the sciences isn’t due to discrimination. They simply aren’t interested and/or aren’t good at it. This assertion is, obviously, wrong. But it is also in line with the “anti-woke” movement, which is fundamentally against equality. I do have to hand it to Epstein: “the women are all weak” is probably the most honest way of characterizing a large part of the “anti-woke” point of view. Just ask Mark Zuckerberg, who recently declared his company was in need of more “masculine energy!”

Epstein’s association with this group allowed him to launder his reputation

Scientists are perhaps one of the easiest groups to buy influence with. On top of that, the process of getting a PhD is tightly controlled by the most influential scientists in any given field — so if you argue too much, your career suffers. Summers, whose 2005 speech suggesting women are stupid was defended as being an abstract intellectual inquiry, spent time emailing Epstein about how best to sexually harass a woman he was pretending to mentor.

The boys’ club at the Edge Foundation created a jumping-off point for social contacts for Epstein. Their “Billionaires Dinner” in 2011, which Epstein attended, featured a number of familiar names that appear in the Epstein files: Musk, Sergey Brin, David Brooks, Marissa Mayer, Jeff Bezos, and Nathan Myhrvold (who would later introduce Epstein to Bill Gates). The “Billionaires Dinner” stopped after Epstein made his final donation to Edge.

Brockman also set up a dinner in 2012 with a very exclusive invite list, which included Bezos, Paul Allen, Brin, Anne Wojcicki, Larry Page, Evan Williams, and Myhrvold. “Please show up alone,” Brockman said to Epstein. MIT Media Lab’s Joichi Ito also seems to be willing to broker meetings between Epstein and Bezos or “Bill.” It’s not clear which Bill is referred to here, but Bill Gates was surely close with Epstein, close enough that the tranche of documents show extensive contact between the two men.

The social consequences, oddly, seem to have freaked these guys out more than anything else

Epstein’s association with this group allowed him to launder his reputation — he had, after all, pleaded guilty to “a single state charge of soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14,” according to the Miami Herald. But here he was, rubbing elbows with “smart” people, some of whom were even considered cool. For instance, there is a long email chain with artist Neri Oxman, trying to coordinate a time to eat together. After a $125,000 donation from Epstein, Oxman gave him a piece of her work. (Oxman’s current husband is billionaire Bill Ackman, a loudmouth hedge fund manager who recently donated $10,000 to the ICE officer who killed Renee Good.) These networking opportunities also did something else; they brought together a lot of influential figures who could suggest that it’s small-minded and prudish to care about sexual harassment and assault.

The Herald revisited Epstein as part of the #MeToo movement, resulting in his rearrest on sex trafficking charges in 2019. The #MeToo movement was premised on the radical notion that no person is too rich or too powerful to escape the law. Rape is illegal. So’s sexual harassment. Some of the most prominent men accused of misconduct — Epstein, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby — did, indeed, face consequences.

There were also social consequences: Powerful men resigned from their jobs in disgrace — or, in some cases, were fired. The men of Silicon Valley did not escape these consequences. Before the Weinstein allegations surfaced, Travis Kalanick of Uber was forced out of the company he founded, after a series of reports on a culture of sexual harassment. The New York Times reported on a payout Google made to Andy Rubin, the father of Android, after he allegedly coerced an employee into sex; two other executives, David Drummond and Richard DeVaul, were also insulated from allegations of misconduct. (Both cofounders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, had dated employees. Eric Schmidt, the former CEO who has had multiple public relationships with women who aren’t his wife, hired a mistress as a consultant.) Venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck resigned after multiple female entrepreneurs said he made unwanted sexual advances.

As it happens, holding powerful men to account was also what #MeToo was about

The social consequences, oddly, seem to have freaked these guys out more than anything else. That was where the “cancellation” panic came from — a fear that people might use their right to freedom of association to avoid people who, for instance, palled around with known pedophiles. It’s not illegal to do that, after all; it’s just gross.

Social consequences are the main ones that matter in the Epstein file drop. Anyone with an internet connection and a little free time can find out who was exchanging friendly emails with an evil man. Take Peter Attia, one of Bari Weiss’ newly named contributors to CBS News, who spent a great deal of time sending crass emails to a convicted sex criminal, including, notoriously, one that noted “pussy is, indeed, low-carb.” Like many women, I am not interested in taking health advice from a guy who says a bunch of sexist shit, largely because I do not believe he cares about my well-being — and that’s true even without Epstein’s involvement. Rather than bow to “cancel culture” by firing Attia, Weiss is retaining him, according to Status. But then, Weiss isn’t too worried about Epstein associates — after all, she named lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who represented Epstein and referred to him as a “close friend,” as one of her other new contributors.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, The Free Press, the outlet Weiss founded, has published a series of articles downplaying the importance of the files. The most significant of the three raises the question of whether we, as a society, will regret the release of these files. The suggestion that they may spread salacious (and untrue) gossip has some merits. But that article is missing a larger point: If Epstein had not escaped federal charges in 2008, there would be no push for the file dump at all. (Indeed, the current president was in favor of releasing the files before calling their contents “made up” as more reporting drew attention to the men’s relationship.) Its existence is a response to the public’s distrust in the justice system’s ability to hold powerful men to account. As it happens, holding powerful men to account was also what #MeToo was about.

“instead of the friars club , can we do a pariahs club dinnr. woody me moonves wynn charlie matt. louis ck. etc.”

Epstein appeared to be monitoring #MeToo closely, and even, at times, seemed to be the canceled man whisperer. At one point, in an email to the MIT Media Lab’s Ito, he writes, “with all these guys getting busted for harassment , i have moved slightly up on the repuation ladder and have been asked everday for advice etc.” In a 2018 email, Epstein writes, “instead of the friars club , can we do a pariahs club dinnr. woody me moonves wynn charlie matt. louis ck. etc.”

Epstein kept track of who he might add to the club. For instance, Charlie Rose — who was apparently close enough that Epstein recommended some women to Rose as assistants — was accused of sexual harassment by more than two dozen women. When the story broke, Epstein emailed multiple people — including Summers — links to the story. Later he wrote to the journalist Michael Wolff, “saw charlie rose at haircutters/ s=ell shocked.” The publicist Peggy Siegal emailed Epstein in 2018 about Steve Wynn resigning from the Republican National Committee because of accusations of sexual harassment, “The witch hunt goes on.” She suggests Epstein should have “double security” and “wear a wig and a baseball c=p in public.” In 2018, Steve Bannon emailed Epstein a link to a Business Insider report about Tom Brokaw, who was accused of sexual harassment. “Make sure Woody sees this,” he writes. “Nobody safe.”

Even the relatively minor “Shitty Media Men” list — a spreadsheet anonymously edited with names of men and accusations against them — makes it into Epstein’s emails. Lorin Stein, the disgraced former editor of The Paris Review who resigned after accusations of sexual impropriety, forwarded to Wolff an email from the writer Stephen Elliott, who intended to sue the list’s creator since he didn’t know who’d made the accusations against him. Epstein promises to “help anyway i can.” Elliott sued Moira Donegan, the list’s creator, six weeks later.

The most extensive emailed advice seems to be to physicist Lawrence Krauss. When Krauss was contacted by journalist Peter Aldhous for comment on a BuzzFeed story about sexual harassment allegations, he forwarded the email to Epstein and repeatedly asked him for advice about how to handle Aldhous. (Krauss strenuously denies the allegations against him, and says he “sought out advice from essentially everyone I knew”.) Krauss sent drafts of his proposed emails about the story to Epstein as well. “Impossible to publish anything about metoo, even if the =uthor was acquitted,” Krauss wrote to Epstein. That was of particular interest to him, because Krauss was planning to write his own #MeToo book, he wrote in another email to Epstein. Later, he wrote to Epstein that a woman on a conciliation committee is “old.. not some young metoo bitch.” This is good news, Krauss notes.

At one point, Soon-Yi Previn, Woody Allen’s wife and the adopted sister of his children, emails Epstein with the subject line “Did you see this in The New York Times today?” “First time a guy wasn’t removed from his job right away due to the MeToo movement,” she wrote. “First time a network decided after an investigation to believe their investigation and the guy as opposed to the woman.” It’s not clear from the email what article she is talking about.

Allen and Previn appear to have been close friends with Epstein, and the #MeToo allegations were of personal interest. Ronan Farrow, whose Harvey Weinstein exposé was one of the major features of the movement, is also Allen’s estranged son — and his sister, Dylan, accused Allen of sexually abusing her when she was seven. In a 2017 Los Angeles Times article, she asked why the #MeToo movement had spared Allen.

Days later, Wolff wrote to Epstein: “I have a bad feeling about this new Woody round. It =ould pull him into the general Harvey pool of the despised and shunned. Cl=arly what Ronan and company are hoping for. I think Bannon may be right. T=is is not going to end until Trump goes down.”

However briefly, it meant money no longer insulated the powerful

“Strange time,” Epstein replied. “I have two mo=e friends up to bat.” Wolff told Epstein those friends won’t be the last, and added, “Big names on the horizon: Michael Douglas, Larry Gagos=an, and still my favorite, Arthur Sulzberger.” In an earlier email, Epstein suggested that Bannon may have “outted” Sulzberger, but for what isn’t clear. “Pinch sulz your silver bullet,” he wrote.

On December 14th, 2017, Sulzberger announced he was stepping down as the publisher of The New York Times, handing the job off to his son. Epstein emailed Kathy Ruemmler and Landon Thomas that same day, two identical messages: “Sulzberger — told you.” (Thomas was a New York Times reporter Epstein had cultivated; Thomas had not only tipped off Epstein to another journalist’s book, he’d even solicited a $30,000 donation from Epstein to a Harlem charity.) As far as I know, Sulzberger has not been accused of wrongdoing.

And all that, I suppose, illustrates how #MeToo actually went too far: However briefly, it meant money no longer insulated the powerful. In 2008, Epstein, who had escaped federal charges via a non-prosecution agreement thanks to Alexander Acosta (who would later become the Labor Secretary in the first Trump administration), got a private wing in jail, and got to leave 12 hours a day, six days a week, for “work release.” He spent a year under “house arrest,” which somehow included trips on his private jet to Manhattan and the Virgin Islands. But in 2019, the renewed scrutiny from #MeToo landed him in the federal jail where he died awaiting charges of sex trafficking minors.

“would have gladly share your expenses for the gawker suit.”

That seems to have been a wake-up call to his associates, like Thiel, who set about undermining the movement to make even rich men answerable for their crimes. Thiel’s influence campaign, such as it was, was less about cultural power and more about actual power. It was smarter than Epstein’s. But it also seems, in retrospect, modeled on the Edge Foundation. The so-called “vibe shift” — the reemergence of slurs as “edgy,” and feminism as “cringe” — may have been at least partially funded by Thiel, whose “Thielbucks” were rumored to be sprinkled around New York City’s Dimes Square. “Anti-woke” is a convenient label because it obscures what the movement is actually against: accountability.

Thiel’s “vibe shift” required less work than what Epstein was up to, largely because it was something that culture reporters were willing — eager, even — to cover. It also had its own social media apparatus set up, in the assorted podcasts that emerged from the Dimes Square scene. Plus, Thiel already had political power through his superdonor status. The Republican Party had already aligned itself with white nationalism in the 2016 election, when Donald Trump came to power on a platform of blatant racism — backed by Thiel, of course.

Epstein and Thiel’s shared aims are clearest in a 2016 email about Thiel’s successful effort to bankrupt gossip site Gawker. Gawker was one of the few publications that wrote about Epstein in the early 2000s, and Epstein evidently held a grudge. “would have gladly share your expenses for the gawker suit,” Epstein wrote. Thiel responded with a smiley face.

There is a short jump between contempt for women and eugenics, and an even shorter one from eugenics to actual fascism

Epstein was an open eugenicist. For example, in this astounding exchange with AI researcher Joscha Bach, whose MIT work was funded by Epstein, the two chat in detail about population culling, among other social engineering thought experiments. (Bach wrote that women “tend to find abstract systems, conflicts and mechanisms intrinsically boring,” which, according to him, is why there are fewer women in the sciences. It seems Epstein had a type.) Bach also said in the exchange that fascism is “the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance,” adding that it “makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable.” Bach is now the executive director of the California Institute for Machine Consciousness, and in a Substack post about the emails, wrote “I am not interested in supporting racists and sexists in any way.”

I am not particularly interested in what Bach believes. I bring up his exchange because — even as a thought experiment — it so strikingly demonstrates that there is a short jump between contempt for women and eugenics, and an even shorter one from eugenics to actual fascism.

Epstein’s influence on the science and tech world meant he was able to inject his ideas into places where other AI impresarios hung out. Epstein “hoped to seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch,” The New York Times wrote. There’s no evidence this idea was anything more than a fantasy. However, it does bear a significant resemblance to Musk’s army of baby mamas — Musk has 14 known children, and the true number may be much higher, according to The Wall Street Journal. “He is driven to correct the historic moment by helping seed the earth with more human beings of high intelligence,” the Journal wrote. Musk uses his social network, X, to recruit potential mothers. He reportedly has a compound for some of those mothers in Austin, Texas.

Trump’s second presidency combines influences from both Musk and Thiel

The most obvious parallel is Musk’s child sexual abuse material machine, Grok. The AI chatbot has been removing clothing from real people, including children, and Musk has been reluctant to stop it. Epstein, in addition to his binders of compact discs of nudes, often emailed people asking for nudes or requesting they take nudes of others. Chillingly, some of the Epstein files simply say “CSAM not scanned.”

Musk has claimed that he hardly knew Epstein, that he was invited to Epstein’s island, Little St. James, and refused. But here he is in the emails, asking Epstein, “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” And again, about a year later, asking, “When should we head to your island on the 2nd?” There’s also Epstein asking Musk how many people would be with him for a “heli to island.” And in 2013, Epstein emails Musk, “thanks for the tour , you would have had fun at xmas.” “Elon Musk” occurs hundreds of times in the archive, and there are at least 16 conversations between Musk and Epstein.

Musk has a long-standing interest in breaking rules — from safety violations at Tesla to SEC settlements to publicly smoking weed despite his government contracts to attempting to back out of the Twitter acquisition he’d agreed to. Perhaps the only thing he believes is that he should get to do whatever he wants. And he’s had his own brush with #MeToo. A day before Business Insider reported that he had sexually harassed a flight attendant, Musk announced he was joining the Republican Party. Musk also had a sexual relationship with a SpaceX employee, as well as a former intern at SpaceX, and, in 2013, asked a female employee to have his babies, according to later reporting from The Wall Street Journal.

Trump’s second presidency combines influences from both Musk and Thiel — Musk spent more than $250 million on Trump’s election, and Thiel’s protege, JD Vance, is the vice president. Trump, of course, has his own ties to Epstein, and is also interested in evading the rule of law. Not only was he never held accountable for his role in the January 6th putsch, he has been using his government position to extract more money for himself — either through what look like bribes, or by suing the IRS directly. He pardoned all of the people who broke into the Capitol at his behest, making it clear that anyone who did what he wanted would suffer no consequences as long as he was in office. Recently, ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents killed two people in Minneapolis. The victims of those shootings are being blamed for their own deaths.

The scale of Trump’s wrongdoing is so vast that the rape and sexual harassment accusations are practically an afterthought

The scale of Trump’s wrongdoing is so vast that the rape and sexual harassment accusations are practically an afterthought. And yet at least 28 women have accused him of sexual misconduct. One woman claimed to have been groped by Trump while Epstein watched. Among his accusers is his first wife, Ivana Trump, who said in a 1993 book that Trump had raped her, and then recanted. (Ivana also said, according to a 1990 Vanity Fair profile, that “he clicks his heels and says, ‘Heil Hitler,’ possibly as a family joke” and that Trump “reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed.”) In fact, one of the few times that Trump has faced any repercussions for his actions was when E. Jean Carroll sued Trump for sexually abusing her in 1996 — and she won.

That all seems distant now. In Trump’s second term, Musk rummaged through the federal government, installing his henchmen in critical positions, slashing funding to programs he didn’t like and killing investigations into his companies. Trump’s appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has reportedly settled sexual misconduct allegations at least twice — as the head of Health and Human Services has ushered in policies that look an awful lot like actual eugenics. Kennedy, it should be noted, was also a friend of Epstein’s, partying with him and flying on his private jet.

Even the release of the files themselves points to the defense of those in power, at the expense of Epstein’s victims. The files were made public well after a congressionally mandated deadline. When they were finally posted, almost 100 victims were identified in the newly released files, resulting in death threats. The government even published unredacted nude photos, some of which may have been of minors. And victims’ advocates claim there are still files that haven’t been released.

We don’t know who Epstein was emailing when he wrote “I loved the torture video.”

Some identities were redacted, though. For instance, we don’t know who Epstein was emailing when he wrote “I loved the torture video.” Or who he was telling in 2009 that that freedom felt “fresh, firm, and creamy.” Or who sent this creepy 2014 email, which reads, “Thank you for a fun night...Your littlest girl was a little naughty.” Or this one, from 2013, which offers to introduce Epstein to a Russian friend and says, “she is fun and gorgeous! Ahh...perfect skin and incredible shape. However, be gentle with her and not a naughty one plz!!!” Or this 2017 email, which reads, “Naughty ? It’s like in lingerie ? Just wanna be correct. Thank you for deserts .”

This is what elite impunity looks like, and it is coming directly from the so-called Department of Justice. It’s hard not to read these files and come to the conclusion that Epstein helped engineer the ultimate elite impunity — in which our society has been totally destroyed so the richest and most powerful men in the world can do whatever they want.

It also seems like Epstein may have had some role in the unraveling of democracy in the US. Thiel has long cultivated Curtis Yarvin, a neo-monoarchist who is close with JD Vance, and obviously has his own ties with Trump, who appears to be trying to turn the US into a dictatorship. Trump is, in the process, weakening the US dollar, freaking out the international community, and otherwise destroying stability.

Of course, that’s an opportunity, as Epstein pointed out to Thiel in 2016. “brexit, just the beginning,” he wrote to Thiel. “return to tribalism . counter to globalization. amazing new alliances. you and I both agreed zero interest rates were too high, and as i said in your office. finding things on their way to collapse , was much easier than finding the next bargain.”

Well, we’re living in the world Epstein wanted. We couldn’t have gotten here without a little help from his friends.</div>

﻿A federal jury has ordered Uber to pay the victim $8.5 million in damages.

A federal jury in Phoenix has found Uber to be liable for the sexual assault of one of its passengers, potentially setting a precedent for more than 3,000 similar cases consolidated in US federal court. As part of the verdict, Uber has been ordered to pay $8.5 million in damages to the victim, Jaylynn Dean, who said she was raped by her Uber driver during a ride to her hotel in November 2023.

The ridehailing giant has long argued that it cannot be held responsible for the criminal actions of drivers on its platform, having faced years of scrutiny for numerous passenger safety concerns.

“Today’s verdict validates the thousands of survivors who have come forward at great personal risk to demand accountability against Uber for its focus on profit over passenger safety,” Sarah London, co-lead and liaison counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement. “The jury heard extensive evidence about Uber’s practices and recognized that Uber is responsible for the conduct of its drivers.”

According to Uber’s most recent US safety report, the company received 12,522 reports of people being sexually assaulted from 2017-2022, with almost 70 percent of reports being against drivers. In a statement reported by The New York Times, Uber spokesperson Matt Kallman said that Uber plans to appeal the verdict.

“This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety,” said Kallman. “We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do.”

Dean’s case was overseen by US district judge Charles Breyer, who is also managing all of the similar, centralized federal lawsuits against Uber. While the verdict is not binding on the other cases, as the first, it could serve as a bellwether for all court proceedings that follow.

            <div id="article-text">The European Commission says TikTok may need ‘to change the basic design’ of its app to comply with the law.

The European Commission says TikTok may need ‘to change the basic design’ of its app to comply with the law.

EU regulators have declared that TikTok’s “addictive design” may put it in breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA), in the preliminary results of an ongoing investigation into the social media app. If those findings are confirmed, TikTok could face a major fine and be required to “change the basic design of its service” in order to comply with the law.

The European Commission took particular issue with TikTok’s “infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications, and its highly personalised recommender system,” arguing that TikTok failed to implement proper safeguards to ensure the “addictive” features don’t “harm the physical and mental wellbeing of its users.”

“For example, by constantly ‘rewarding’ users with new content, certain design features of TikTok fuel the urge to keep scrolling and shift the brain of users into ‘autopilot mode’,” the Commission says in a press release. “Scientific research shows that this may lead to compulsive behaviour and reduce users’ self-control.”

The Commission suggests that TikTok’s existing parental controls and screen-time features are insufficient, and that TikTok may need to make them more effective, along with limiting infinite scroll and adapting its recommendation algorithm.

TikTok now has the chance to defend itself and its design before the investigation is concluded. If found guilty of violating the DSA, it could face a fine worth up to 6 percent of its worldwide annual turnover. The wide-ranging investigation was opened in February 2024, and has already found TikTok at fault for insufficient transparency in its advertising and its provision of public data to researchers.

“The Commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform,” an unnamed TikTok spokesperson told the Financial Times. “We will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us.”

It’s been a tumultuous start to the year for TikTok, which is finally under new ownership in the US, the transfer followed almost immediately by a weekend-long outage. Its new US owners have sparked fresh concerns about censorship and the design of the upcoming US-only algorithm, along with questions in Congress about whether its legal problems are truly resolved. Meanwhile, restrictions and bans on social media are increasingly popular among lawmakers worldwide, with Spain the latest country to propose blocking the apps from users under 16.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132319/experimental-surgery-colorectal-cancer-survivors-pregnant-birth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year. The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.

That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted. One Anthropic safety researcher tweeted that he would change the direction of his research in light of those results; another employee at the company simply wrote, “mom come pick me up i’m scared.”

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. For one thing, METR’s estimates of the abilities of specific models come with substantial error bars. As METR explicitly stated on X, Opus 4.5 might be able to regularly complete only tasks that take humans about two hours, or it might succeed on tasks that take humans as long as 20 hours. Given the uncertainties intrinsic to the method, it was impossible to know for sure.

“There are a bunch of ways that people are reading too much into the graph,” says Sydney Von Arx, a member of METR’s technical staff.

More fundamentally, the METR plot does not measure AI abilities writ large, nor does it claim to. In order to build the graph, METR tests the models primarily on coding tasks, evaluating the difficulty of each by measuring or estimating how long it takes humans to complete it—a metric that not everyone accepts. Claude Opus 4.5 might be able to complete certain tasks that take humans five hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s anywhere close to replacing a human worker.

METR was founded to assess the risks posed by frontier AI systems. Though it is best known for the exponential trend plot, it has also worked with AI companies to evaluate their systems in greater detail and published several other independent research projects, including a widely covered July 2025 study suggesting that AI coding assistants might actually be slowing software engineers down.

But the exponential plot has made METR’s reputation, and the organization appears to have a complicated relationship with that graph’s often breathless reception. In January, Thomas Kwa, one of the lead authors on the paper that introduced it, wrote a blog post responding to some criticisms and making clear its limitations, and METR is currently working on a more extensive FAQ document. But Kwa isn’t optimistic that these efforts will meaningfully shift the discourse. “I think the hype machine will basically, whatever we do, just strip out all the caveats,” he says.

Nevertheless, the METR team does think that the plot has something meaningful to say about the trajectory of AI progress. “You should absolutely not tie your life to this graph,” says Von Arx. “But also,” she adds, “I bet that this trend is gonna hold.”

Part of the trouble with the METR plot is that it’s quite a bit more complicated than it looks. The x-axis is simple enough: It tracks the date when each model was released. But the y-axis is where things get tricky. It records each model’s “time horizon,” an unusual metric that METR created—and that, according to Kwa and Von Arx, is frequently misunderstood.

To understand exactly what model time horizons are, it helps to know all the work that METR put into calculating them. First, the METR team assembled a collection of tasks ranging from quick multiple-choice questions to detailed coding challenges—all of which were somehow relevant to software engineering. Then they had human coders attempt most of those tasks and evaluated how long it took them to finish. In this way, they assigned the tasks a human baseline time. Some tasks took the experts mere seconds, whereas others required several hours.

When METR tested large language models on the task suite, they found that advanced models could complete the fast tasks with ease—but as the models attempted tasks that had taken humans more and more time to finish, their accuracy started to fall off. From a model’s performance, the researchers calculated the point on the time scale of human tasks at which the model would complete about 50% of the tasks successfully. That point is the model’s time horizon.

All that detail is in the blog post and the academic paper that METR released along with the original time horizon plot. But the METR plot is frequently passed around on social media without this context, and so the true meaning of the time horizon metric can get lost in the shuffle. One common misapprehension is that the numbers on the plot’s y-axis—around five hours for Claude Opus 4.5, for example—represent the length of time that the models can operate independently. They do not. They represent how long it takes humans to complete tasks that a model can successfully perform.  Kwa has seen this error so frequently that he made a point of correcting it at the very top of his recent blog post, and when asked what information he would add to the versions of the plot circulating online, he said he would include the word “human” whenever the task completion time was mentioned.

As complex and widely misinterpreted as the time horizon concept might be, it does make some basic sense: A model with a one-hour time horizon could automate some modest portions of a software engineer’s job, whereas a model with a 40-hour horizon could potentially complete days of work on its own. But some experts question whether the amount of time that humans take on tasks is an effective metric for quantifying AI capabilities. “I don’t think it’s necessarily a given fact that because something takes longer, it’s going to be a harder task,” says Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a PhD student at UC Berkeley who studies model evaluation.

Von Arx says that she, too, was originally skeptical that time horizon was the right measure to use. What convinced her was seeing the results of her and her colleagues’ analysis. When they calculated the 50% time horizon for all the major models available in early 2025 and then plotted each of them on the graph, they saw that the time horizons for the top-tier models were increasing over time—and, moreover, that the rate of advancement was speeding up. Every seven-ish months, the time horizon doubled, which means that the most advanced models could complete tasks that took humans nine seconds in mid 2020, 4 minutes in early 2023, and 40 minutes in late 2024. “I can do all the theorizing I want about whether or not it makes sense, but the trend is there,” Von Arx says.

It’s this dramatic pattern that made the METR plot such a blockbuster. Many people learned about it when they read AI 2027, a viral sci-fi story cum quantitative forecast positing that superintelligent AI could wipe out humanity by 2030. The writers of AI 2027 based some of their predictions on the METR plot and cited it extensively. In Von Arx’s words, “It’s a little weird when the way lots of people are familiar with your work is this pretty opinionated interpretation.”

Of course, plenty of people invoke the METR plot without imagining large-scale death and destruction. For some AI boosters, the exponential trend indicates that AI will soon usher in an era of radical economic growth. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, for example, recently put out a post titled “2026: This is AGI,” which used the METR plot to argue that AI that can act as an employee or contractor will soon arrive. “The provocation really was like, ‘What will you do when your plans are measured in centuries?’” says Sonya Huang, a general partner at Sequoia and one of the post’s authors.

Just because a model achieves a one-hour time horizon on the METR plot, however, doesn’t mean that it can replace one hour of human work in the real world. For one thing, the tasks on which the models are evaluated don’t reflect the complexities and confusion of real-world work. In their original study, Kwa, Von Arx, and their colleagues quantify what they call the “messiness” of each task according to criteria such as whether the model knows exactly how it is being scored and whether it can easily start over if it makes a mistake (for messy tasks, the answer to both questions would be no). They found that models do noticeably worse on messy tasks, although the overall pattern of improvement holds for both messy and non-messy ones.

And even the messiest tasks that METR considered can’t provide much information about AI’s ability to take on most jobs, because the plot is based almost entirely on coding tasks. “A model can get better at coding, but it’s not going to magically get better at anything else,” says Daniel Kang, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In a follow-up study, Kwa and his colleagues did find that time horizons for tasks in other domains also appear to be on exponential trajectories, but that work was much less formal.

Despite these limitations, many people admire the group’s research. “The METR study is one of the most carefully designed studies in the literature for this kind of work,” Kang told me. Even Gary Marcus, a former NYU professor and professional LLM curmudgeon, described much of the work that went into the plot as “terrific” in a blog post.

Some people will almost certainly continue to read the METR plot as a prognostication of our AI-induced doom, but in reality it’s something far more banal: a carefully constructed scientific tool that puts concrete numbers to people’s intuitive sense of AI progress. As METR employees will readily agree, the plot is far from a perfect instrument. But in a new and fast-moving domain, even imperfect tools can have enormous value.

“This is a bunch of people trying their best to make a metric under a lot of constraints. It is deeply flawed in many ways,” Von Arx says. “I also think that it is one of the best things of its kind.”

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.
