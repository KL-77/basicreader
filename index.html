            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a new presidential administration comes in, it is responsible for filling around 4,000 jobs sprinkled across the federal government’s vast bureaucracy. These political appointees help carry out the president’s agenda, and, at least in theory, make government agencies responsive to elected officials.

Some of these roles—the secretary of state, for example—are well-known. Others, such as the deputy assistant secretary for textiles, consumer goods, materials, critical minerals & metals industry & analysis, are more obscure.

Historically, science agencies like NASA or the National Institutes of Health tend to have fewer political appointees than many other parts of the federal government. Sometimes, very senior roles—with authority over billions of dollars of spending, and the power to shape entire fields of research—are filled without any direct input from the White House or Congress. The arrangement reflects a long-running argument that scientists should oversee the work of funding and conducting research with very little interference from political leaders.

Since the early 2000s, according to federal employment records, NIH, the country’s premier biomedical research agency, has usually had just a few political appointees within its workforce. (As of November 2025, that workforce numbered around 17,500 people, after significant cuts.) Staff scientists and external experts played a key role in selecting the directors of the 27 institutes and centers that make up NIH. That left the selection of people for powerful positions largely outside of direct White House oversight.

What is the future of that status quo under the Trump administration?

Those questions have recently swirled at NIH. The arrival of political appointees in the kinds of positions previously held by civil servants, and apparent changes to hiring practices for other key positions, have raised concerns among current and former officials about a new era of politicization.

For decades, NIH has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. But conservative lawmakers have periodically raised questions about some of the agency’s spending, and according to one 2014 survey, the agency is perceived by federal executives as being a progressive place. (Since the early 2000s, some data suggests, US scientists as a whole have grown considerably more liberal relative to the general population.)

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many conservatives have criticized NIH for funding the kind of controversial virology experiments that some experts believe may have started the pandemic, and for promoting public health strategies that many on the right viewed as unscientific and authoritarian. One of the NIH institute directors, Anthony Fauci, who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 until his retirement in 2022, came to be a highly polarizing figure, described on the right as an unelected official wielding considerable power.

Over the years, some biomedical researchers have argued for changes to the way NIH hires and retains people in leadership positions. In 2019, the agency announced plans to impose term limits on some midlevel roles, in a bid to diversify its management. More recently, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Joseph Marine argued in an essay for The Free Press that NIH should set five to 10-year term limits on the directors of individual NIH institutes. “Regular turnover of leadership,” he wrote, “brings fresh ideas and a healthy reassessment of priorities.”

Shortly after winning the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump tapped Jay Bhattacharya, a prominent critic of NIH, to lead the agency. It may not be entirely surprising that an administration advocating for reforms to NIH would seek to flip key management positions that often experience little turnover.

Former official Mike Lauer, who until early 2025 oversaw NIH’s vast external grants program, said there were signs before Trump’s second inauguration that institute directors might be subject to fresh political scrutiny.

“There was a frustration that so much of the agency’s direction, as well as financial decision-making, was being made by people who are outside of the political sphere,” Lauer told Undark. He pointed to a line in Project 2025, a proposed roadmap for the Trump administration that was produced by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “Funding for scientific research,” the report argues, “should not be controlled by a small group of highly paid and unaccountable insiders at the NIH, many of whom stay in power for decades.”

Soon after Trump’s inauguration, some senior officials at NIH were put on administrative leave or abruptly departed, including Lawrence Tabak, who had spent more than a decade as principal deputy director and served as NIH’s interim leader for almost two years during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the same time, the administration grew the number of political appointees at NIH. As of late June, according to federal records, the Trump administration had placed nine political appointees at the agency, up from four the year before—itself higher than in most previous years. One of them, Seana Cranston, is a former Republican Congressional staffer who serves as chief of staff to the NIH Director; her predecessor was a career civil servant who had spent nearly 40 years in the NIH, the last four as chief of staff. Another is Michael Allen, who took the role of chief operating officer for the $6.5 billion NIAID, Fauci’s former institute. (Allen was appointed with no official announcement, and appears to have no official biography or background information posted on NIH websites.)

Those numbers still left NIH with fewer political appointees than many other agencies, including NASA, a comparably sized science agency.

The administration has departed from the traditional process for hiring NIH’s 27 institute and center directors, who are responsible for overseeing most of the funding decisions and day-to-day operations of NIH.

In the spring of 2025, five of those directors—including the head of NIAID—were fired or placed on administrative leave. (They have all since been removed from their positions.)

Then, in September, part of the search committee for the National Institute of Mental Health was abruptly disbanded, and then just as suddenly reconvened, according to Joshua Gordon, the former head of that institute, and one other source close to NIH.

In October, the directorship of another agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, was filled by a close personal friend of Vice President JD Vance, without any apparent search process — a move that multiple former NIH officials told Undark may be unprecedented.

By then, 13 other NIH institutes and centers had vacant leadership posts. Other roles have opened up more recently: In an email to NIH staff on Dec. 30, Bhattacharya announced the departure of Walter Koroshetz, leader of the agency’s main neuroscience research institute. In the email, Bhattacharya seemed to suggest he had opposed the decision: “Dr. Koroshetz’s performance as Director has been exceptional,” Bhattacharya wrote, but “the Department of Health and Human Services has elected to pursue a leadership transition.”

In early January, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute announced his retirement, bringing the total number of open posts to 15.

The searches, NIH insiders say, appear to be happening on a compressed timeline. And while the NIH director has typically relied on search committees consisting of both NIH career scientists and external experts, multiple sources close to NIH say the agency has not formed those kinds of committees to make the latest round of hires.

In response to questions from Undark in early January, the Department of Health and Human Services sent a brief emailed statement, signed “NIH Press Team,” explaining that “an NIH leadership team with experience in scientific agency management will consider the applicant pool and make recommendations to the NIH Director.” The press representative declined to respond to follow-up questions about who would be on that team, or why the hiring process had changed.

Those changes have prompted speculation among some NIH insiders that the Trump administration is seeking to exert more political control over the hiring of directorships.

“Having external members on the search committee is vitally important for preventing politicization,” said Mark Histed, an NIH scientist who has recently been a critic — on his personal time, he stresses — of Trump’s approach to the agency. “Because, as you can imagine, if you’ve got a bunch of external scientists, it’s a lot harder to ram down what the White House wants, because people are not part of the political system.”

That kind of open and non-politicized search process, Histed said in a follow-up interview, isn’t unique to NIH: It’s one widely used by scientific institutions around the world. And it has worked, he argued, to help make NIH a scientific juggernaut: “That process,” he said, “led to 80 years of staggering scientific success.”

Members of Congress have taken notice. In language attached to the current appropriations bill moving through Congress, lawmakers direct NIH “to maintain its longstanding practice of including external scientists and stakeholders” in the search process. (Agencies are supposed to follow these Congressional instructions, but they are not binding.) In late January, Diana DeGette, a Democratic representative from Colorado, sponsored a bill that, according to a press release, would “Protect NIH From Political Interference” by, among other steps, capping the number of political appointees at the agency.

Lauer, the former NIH grants chief, took a broader historical view of the changes. There has long been a tug-of-war, he said, between presidential administrations that seek more political control over an agency, and civil servants and other bureaucratic experts who may resist that perceived incursion. From the point of view of politicians and their staff, Lauer said, “what they’ll say—I understand where they’re coming from—what they’ll say is, is that more political control means that the agency is going to be responsive to the will of the electorate, that there’s a greater degree of transparency and public accountability.”

Those upsides can be significant, Lauer said, but there are also downsides, including more short-term thinking, unstable budgets, and the potential loss of expertise and competence.

Mark Richardson, a political scientist at Georgetown University, is an expert on politicization and the federal bureaucracy. In his work, he said, he has observed a correlation between how much political parties disagree over the role of a specific agency, and the degree to which presidential administrations seek to exert control there through appointees and other personnel choices. NIH has historically fallen alongside agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that are subject to broad alignment across the parties.

“I think what you’re seeing more with the Trump administration is kind of an expansion of political conflict to these types of agencies,” Richardson said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Exterminators keep getting calls for a reason. Wood-devouring insects, such as beetles, termites, and carpenter ants, are constantly chewing through walls or infecting trees and breaking them down. The fight against these insects usually involved noxious insecticides; but now, at least some of them can be eliminated using a certain species of fungus.

Infestations of bark beetles are the bane of spruce trees. Eurasian spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) ingest bark high in phenolic compounds, organic molecules that often act as antioxidants and antimicrobials. They protect spruce bark from pathogenic fungi—and the beetles take advantage. Their bodies boost the antimicrobial power of these compounds by turning them into substances that are even more toxic to fungi. This would seem to make the beetles invulnerable to fungi.

There is a way to get past the beetles’ borrowed defenses, though. Led by biochemist Ruo Sun, a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, found that some strains of the fungus Beauveria bassiana are capable of infecting and killing the pests.

“Insect herbivores have long been known to accumulate plant defense metabolites from their diet as defenses against their own enemies,” she said in a study recently published in PNAS. “However, as shown here for B. bassiana, fungal pathogens are able to circumvent the toxicity of these dietary defenses and cause disease.”

Populations of bark beetles have recently exploded in temperate forests because of climate change. One species they feed on is the Norway spruce (Picea abies), which makes organic phenolic compounds known as stilbenes and flavonoids. Stilbenes are hydrocarbons that function as secondary metabolites for plants, and flavonoids, which are polyphenols, are also secondary plant metabolites that are often antioxidants. The spruce links both classes of compounds with sugars and relies on their antibacterial and antifungal activity.

When metabolized by the beetles, the spruce sugars are removed through hydrolysis, converting them into aglycones that are even more toxic to microscopic invaders. Despite that, some fungi appear to be able to deactivate these compounds. Strains of the fungal insect pathogen B. bassiana have been documented as killing some of these beetles in the wild.

Sun wanted to put this fungus to the test. While not all strains have been effective at eliminating bark beetles, she and her team extracted the fungus from beetles that had succumbed to it. They bred these strains in their lab to see how effective they would be against the insects. They identified the genes that gave these fungi their ability to metabolize phenolic compounds ingested by the beetles and detoxify them so they were no longer protective. They then experimented with knocking out these genes to see whether the mutant fungi would still be able to take down beetles.

Once beetles were infected with B. bassiana, the researchers found the fungus detoxifies protective compounds in two phases. The aglycones that were made so potent by the removal of sugars from spruce stilbenes and flavanoids are made weaker by having the sugar restored in the first phase. Methylation happens next. After this phase, the sugar is linked to a methyl group (CH3), forming a type of methylglucoside. This particular methylglucoside is harmless to the fungus. Mutant strains of the fungus that had their detoxification genes knocked out could not produce methylglucoside, so they were not as effective at infecting beetles and were nowhere near as lethal.

B. bassiana is not the only fungus that is capable of this detox. Other species, including the infamous Cordyceps militaris that terrorized a dystopian society in The Last of Us (though it will not turn people into fungus monsters), are capable of producing methylglucosides from stilbenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that are supposed to protect plants from infection and are borrowed by the insects that gorge on them.

“Besides direct detoxification, fungi such as B. bassiana could have other mechanisms of resisting plant defense compounds,” Sun said. “[Some] are known to excrete compounds like resveratrol from fungal cells, and so could also play a role in increasing fungal growth and virulence on substrates containing toxic compounds.”

Fungi could be weaponized as pest control in the future. The researchers think it is possible that the genes that enable B. bassiana to detoxify antifungal substances could enable it to metabolize other defensive plant substances ingested by harmful insects. Instead of sprayers full of dangerous chemicals, exterminators may soon arrive with petri dishes instead.</div>

            <div id="article-text">It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. So every month, we highlight a handful of the best stories that nearly slipped through the cracks. January’s list includes a lip-syncing robot; using brewer’s yeast as scaffolding for lab-grown meat;  hunting for Leonardo da Vinci’s DNA in his art; and new evidence that humans really did transport the stones to build Stonehenge from Wales and northern Scotland, rather than being transported by glaciers.

Stonehenge is an iconic landmark of endless fascination to tourists and researchers alike. There has been a lot of recent chemical analysis identifying where all the stones that make up the structure came from, revealing that many originated in quarries a significant distance away. So how were the stones transported to their current location?

One theory holds that glaciers moved the bluestones at least part of the way from Wales to Salisbury Plain in southern England, while others contend that humans moved them—although precisely how that was done has yet to be conclusively determined. Researchers at Curtin University have now produced the strongest scientific evidence to date that it was humans, not glaciers, that transported the stones, according to a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Curtin’s Anthony Clarke and co-authors relied on mineral fingerprinting to arrive at their conclusions. In 2024, Clarke’s team discovered the Stonehenge Altar Stone originated from the Orkney region in the very northeast corner of Scotland, rather than Wales. This time, they analyzed hundreds of zircon crystals collected from rivers close to the historic monument, looking for evidence of Pleistocene-era sediment. Per Clarke, if the stones had “sailed” to the plain from further north, there would be a distinct mineral signature in that sediment as the transported rocks eroded over time. They didn’t find that signature, making it far more likely that humans transported the stone.

Everyone knows grasshoppers can hop, but they can also flap their wings, jump, and glide, moving seamlessly across both the ground and through the air. That ability inspired scientists from Princeton University to devise a novel approach to building robotic wings, according to a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. This could one day enable multimodal locomotion for miniature robots with extended flight times.

According to the authors, grasshoppers have two sets of wings: forewings and hindwings. Forewings are mostly used for protection and camouflage, while the latter are involved in flapping and gliding, and are corrugated to allow them to fold into the insect’s body. The team took CT scans to capture the geometry of grasshopper wings and used the scans to 3D print model wings with varying designs. Next they tested each variant in a water channel to study how water flowed around the wing, isolating key features like a wing’s shape or corrugation to see how this impacted the flow.

Once they had perfected their design, they printed new wings and attached them to small frames to create grasshopper-sized gliders. The team then launched the gliders across the lab and used motion capture to evaluate how well they flew. The glider performed as well as actual grasshoppers. In addition, they found that a smooth wing resulted in more efficient gliding. So why do real grasshopper wings have corrugations? The authors suggest that these evolved because they help with executing steep angles.

Humanoid robots are fascinating, but nobody would mistake them for actual humans, in part because even the ones that have faces are far too limited in facial gestures, including lip motion—hence, the “Uncanny Valley.” Columbia University engineers have now created a robot capable of learning facial lip motions for speaking and singing. According to a paper published in Science Robotics, the resulting robotic face was able to speak words in several different languages and sing an AI-generated song. (Its AI-generated debut album is aptly titled hello world.).

What makes human faces so uniquely capable of expression are the dozens of muscles lying just under the skin. Robotic faces are rigid and hence only have a limited range of motion. The Columbia team built their robotic face out of flexible material augmented with 26 motors (actuators). The robot learned to how its face moved in response to different actuator activity by watching itself in a mirror as it attempted thousands of random facial expressions. Eventually it learned how to achieve specific facial gestures.

The next step was to let the robot watch recorded videos of humans talking and singing, augmented with an AI algorithm that enabled it to learn exactly how the human mouths moved when performing those tasks so it could lip sync along. The resulting lip motion wasn’t perfect;  the robot struggled with “B” and “W” sounds in particular. But the authors believe the robot will improve with more practice; combining this ability with ChatGPT or Gemini could further improve its lip-syncing ability.

In 2020, scientists analyzed the microbes found on several of Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings and discovered that each had its own distinct microbiome/. A second team, working with the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project in France, collected and analyzed swabs taken from centuries-old art in a private collection housed in Florence, Italy. They concluded that microbial signatures could be used to differentiate artwork according to the materials used—dubbing this emerging subfield “arteomics.”

Yet another team collaborating with the project painstakingly assembled Leonardo’s family tree in 2021, spanning 21 generations from 1331 to the present, resulting a full-length book published last year. The idea was that this will one day provide a means of conducting DNA testing to confirm whether the bones interred in Leonardo’s grave are actually the his. And now the project’s scientists are back with a preprint posted to the bioRxiv, announcing the successful sequencing of human DNA collected from a handful of artifacts associated with Leonardo—including a drawing of the Holy Child that some scholars attribute to Leonardo, as well as letters from a da Vinci family member.

The team lightly swabbed samples from the artifacts’ surfaces and were able to recover human Y-chromosome sequences from several of the samples. Several of these sequences were related and the authors speculate that some might even be Leonardo’s, although they cautioned that the samples would need to be compared to samples taken from the artist’s notebooks, burial site, and family tomb to make a definitive identification. The authors also found DNA from bacteria, fungi, flowers, and animals in some of the samples, as well as traces of viruses and parasites.

Lab-grown meat is often touted as a more environmentally responsible alternative to the real deal, but carnivorous consumers are often put off by the unappealing mouthfeel and texture (and, for me, a weird oily aftertaste). A new method using spent brewer’s yeast to make edible “scaffolding” for cultivating meat in the lab might one day offer a solution, according to a paper published in the journal Frontiers in  Nutrition.

Typically, a nutrient broth is used as a source of bacteria for the scaffolding. But Richard Day of University College London and his co-authors decided to use brewer’s yeast, usually discarded as waste, to culture a species of bacteria known for making high-quality cellulose. Then they tested the mechanical and structural properties of that cellulose with a “chewing machine.” They concluded that the cellulose made from spent brewer’s yeast was much closer in texture to real meat than the cellulose scaffolding made from a nutrient broth. The next step is to incorporate fat and muscle cells into the cellulose, as well as testing yeast from different kinds of beer.

Gears have been around for thousands of years; the Chinese were using them in two-wheeled chariots as far back as 3000 BCE, and they are a mainstay in windmills, clocks, and the famed Antikythera mechanism. Roboticists also use gears in their inventions, but whether they are made of wood, metal or plastic, such gears tend to be inflexible and hence more prone to breakage. That’s why New York University mathematician Leif Reistroph and colleagues decided to see if flowing air or water could be used to rotate robotic structures.

Ristroph’s lab frequently addresses all manner of colorful real-world puzzles: fine-tuning the recipe for the perfect bubble, for instance; exploring the physics of the Hula-Hoop; or the formation processes underlying so-called “stone forests” common in China and Madagascar. In 2021, his lab built a working Tesla valve, in accordance with the inventor’s design; the following year they studied the complex aerodynamics of what makes a good paper airplane—specifically what is needed for smooth gliding; and in 2024 they cracked the conundrum of the “reverse sprinkler” problem that physicists like Richard Feynman, among others, had grappled with since the 1940s.

For their latest paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, Ristroph et al. wanted to devise something that functioned like a gear only with flowing liquid driving the motion, instead of teeth grinding against each other. They conducted a series of experiments in which they immersed cylindrical rotors in a glycerol-and-water solution. One cylinder would rotate while the other was passive.

They found that the rotating cylinder, combined with fluid flow, was sufficient to induce rotation in the passive cylinder. The flows functioned much in the same way as gear teeth when the cylinders were close together. Moving the cylinders further apart caused the active cylinder to rotate faster, looping the flows around the passive cylinder—essentially mimicking a belt and pulley system.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">About a decade ago, many media outlets—including WIRED—zeroed in on a weird trend at the intersection of mental health, drug science, and Silicon Valley biohacking: microdosing, or the practice of taking a small amount of a psychedelic drug seeking not full-blown hallucinatory revels but gentler, more stable effects. Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind.

Anecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. It was a miracle for many. Others remained wary. Could 5 percent of a dose of acid really do all that? A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing’s benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression.

A Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression.

The study has not yet been published. But MindBio’s CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.)

This means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing.

“It’s probably a nail in the coffin of using microdosing to treat clinical depression,” Hanka says. “It probably improves the way depressed people feel—just not enough to be clinically significant or statistically meaningful.”

However despairing, these results conform with the suspicions of some more skeptical researchers, who have long believed that the benefits of microdosing are less the result of a teeny-tiny psychedelic catalyst, and more attributable to the so-called “placebo effect.”

In 2020, Jay A. Olson, then a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, conducted an experiment. He gave 33 participants a placebo, telling them it was actually a dose of a psilocybin-like drug. They were led to believe there was no placebo group. Other researchers who were in on the bit acted out the effects of the drug, in a room treated with trippy lighting and other visual stimulants, in an attempt to curate the “optimized expectation” of a psychedelic experience.

The resulting paper, titled “Tripping on Nothing,” found that a majority of participants had reported feeling the effects of the drug—despite there being no real drug whatsoever. “The main conclusion we had is that the placebo effect can be stronger than expected in psychedelic studies,” Olson, now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, tells WIRED. “Placebo effects were stronger than what you would get from microdosing.”

More than a stick in the eye to the microdosing faithful, Olson maintains that the study’s key findings had more to do with the actual role, and power, of the placebo effect. “The public has a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect,” he says. “There’s this assumption that placebo effects are extremely weak, or that they’re not real.”

Olson goes on to say that placebo effects in psychedelic trials can be further juiced by the hype around the drugs themselves. Patients may enter a trial expecting a certain experience, and their mind is able to conjure a version of that experience, in turn. In Olson’s study, it wasn’t a matter of microdosing effects not being real, but that those effects may be caused by environment, or patient expectation. As he puts it: “It can be true at the same time that microdosing can have positive effects on people, and that those effects are perhaps almost entirely placebo.”

This itself raises a sticky question about MindBio’s study. How could a placebo group, who thinks they’re taking LSD, perform better than an active control group, members of which both think they’re taking LSD and are actually taking it? The answer comes from the design of the study itself.

Using what’s called a “double-dummy” design, MindBio’s researchers informed patients that they’d either be receiving LSD, a caffeine pill, or a dose of methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin or Concerta. (No patients were actually administered the methylphenidate.) This means that patient expectation was lowered, as they could ascribe any perceived effects to either the LSD or either of the active placebos. Patients taking LSD microdoses may well have believed they were merely on a stimulant. All patients followed an adaptation of the “Fadiman protocol,” a popular microdosing programme that sees patients taking a small dose of the given drug once every three days.

Jim Fadiman, the veteran psychedelic researcher after whom the protocol is named, rejects MindBio’s conclusions, and trial design, out of hand. Because, Fadiman believes, patients were given the active caffeine placebo, their reported benefits may well be attributable not to a pure placebo effect, but to the actual psychoactive properties of that drug.

“Double-dummy is a remarkably apt term,” Fadiman, 86, sneers. “What I know is that if you take enough caffeine, you will not be depressed!”

Fadiman points to MindBio’s earlier, Phase 2A study, recently published in the journal Neuropharmacology, which drew markedly different conclusions. It was a non-blinded, so-called “open label” study, meaning patients knew definitely that they were being microdosed with LSD. This study found that MADRS scores decreased by 59.5 percent, with effects lasting as long as six months. It also found improvements in stress, rumination, anxiety, and patient quality of life. Fadiman says that this reportage is more consistent with his own research on microdosing. “Their prior study did wonderfully with LSD,” Fadiman says. “I have collected literally hundreds of real world reports over the years that validate those findings.”

MindBio’s Hanka stands by the science. “We are bewildered at the significant difference between the open label Phase 2A trial results and the Phase 2B trial results,” he says. “But that is the nature of good science—a properly controlled trial will get a proper result. Our Phase 2B trial was of the highest standard, a triple-blind, double-dummy, active placebo controlled trial. I haven’t seen another psychedelic trial that has gone to these lengths to control and blind a trial.”

Despite these findings, some microdosing true believers don’t seem especially shaken. In 2017, writer Ayelet Waldman (best known as the author of the Mommy-Track Mysteries series of novels that follow the adventures of stay-at-home-mom-cum-sleuth Juliet Applebaum) published A Really Good Day, a diaristic account of her own self-experiments using microdosing to treat an intractable mood disorder. She tells WIRED she’s not especially bothered by the implication that her positive shifts in mood may have merely been placebo. “In my book I took very seriously the possibility that what I was experiencing was the mother of all placebo effects,” Waldman says. “I wrote about this a number of times in various chapters and decided in the end it didn’t matter. What mattered was that I felt better.”

Perhaps that’s true enough. If the effects are measurable, and repeatable, then it should hardly matter if they’re attributable to a sub-perceptual dose of lysergic acid, or to the (perhaps equally profound) mysteries of the placebo. Still, one cannot help but wonder why anyone looking to use LSD to aid severe clinical depression would bother assuming the legal risk of procuring and consuming a drug still classified under Schedule I by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

Certainly, for his part, Justin Hanka seems content to pivot MindBio’s research into a new field. His next project is “Booze A.I.”: a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to scan the human voice for relevant biomarkers that determine blood alcohol concentration. He’s leaving microdosing in the rearview. “I put millions of dollars into this myself,” he says. “Had I known six years ago what I know about psychedelics, I probably wouldn’t have ventured into the microdosing field.”

            <h2>The TV industry finally concedes that the future may not be in 8K</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lg-joins-the-rest-of-the-world-accepts-that-people-dont-want-8k-tvs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.

In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the first 8K TVs started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the first 8K TVs in the US, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an 8K computer monitor. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the industry’s claim that 8K TVs were “the future.”

However, 8K never proved its necessity or practicality.

LG Display is no longer making 8K LCD or OLED panels, FlatpanelsHD reported today. Earlier this month, an LG Display representative told FlatpanelsHD that the panel supplier is “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.”

“As our technical readiness is already complete, LG Display is fully prepared to respond immediately whenever the market and customers determine that the timing is right,” LG Display’s representative said.

LG Electronics was the first and only company to sell 8K OLED TVs, starting with the 88-inch Z9 in 2019. In 2022, it lowered the price-of-entry for an 8K OLED TV by $7,000 by charging $13,000 for a 76.7-inch TV.

FlatpanelsHD cited anonymous sources who said that LG Electronics would no longer restock the 2024 QNED99T, which is the last LCD 8K TV that it released.

LG’s 8K abandonment follows other brands distancing themselves from 8K. TCL, which released its last 8K TV in 2021, said in 2023 that it wasn’t making more 8K TVs due to low demand. Sony discontinued its last 8K TVs in April and is unlikely to return to the market, as it plans to sell the majority ownership of its Bravia TVs to TCL.

The tech industry tried to convince people that the 8K living room was coming soon. But since the 2010s, people have mostly adopted 4K. In September 2024, research firm Omdia reported that there were “nearly 1 billion 4K TVs currently in use.” In comparison, 1.6 million 8K TVs had been sold since 2015, Paul Gray, Omdia’s TV and video technology analyst, said, noting that 8K TV sales peaked in 2022.

That helps explain why membership at the 8K Association, launched by stakeholders Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and panel maker AU Optronics in 2019, is dwindling. As of this writing, the group’s membership page lists 16 companies, including just two TV manufacturers (Samsung and Panasonic). Membership no longer includes any major TV panel suppliers. At the end of 2022, the 8K Association had 33 members, per an archived version of the nonprofit’s online membership page via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Upon its debut, the 8K Association said that its goals include “promoting 8K TVs and 8K content to consumers and professionals” and “helping secure 8K native content for members.”

It wasn’t hard to predict that 8K TVs wouldn’t take off. In addition to being too expensive for many households, there’s been virtually zero native 8K content available to make investing in an 8K display worthwhile. An ongoing lack of content was also easy to predict, given that there’s still a dearth of 4K content, and many streaming, broadcasting, and gaming users still rely on 1920×1080 resolution.

Gaming was supposed to be one of the best drivers for 8K adoption. The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro was originally marketed as supporting 8K. Sony officially rescinded that promise in June 2024, though. Due to bandwidth limitations, the PS5 Pro could only deliver 8K via Display Stream Compression over HDMI 2.1, making the feature incompatible with some 8K TVs.

There’s also the crucial question of whether people would even notice the difference between 4K and 8K. Science suggests that you could, but in limited situations.

The University of Cambridge’s display resolution calculator, which is based on a study from researchers at the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology and Meta, funded by Meta, and published in Nature in October, suggests that your eyes can only make use of 8K resolution on a 50-inch screen if you’re viewing it from a distance of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or less. Similarly, you would have to be sitting pretty close (2–3 meters/6.6–9.8 feet) to an 80-inch or 100-inch TV for 8K resolution to be beneficial. The findings are similar to those from RTINGs.com.

Even those interested in spending a lot of money on new-age TV technologies are more likely to investigate features other than 8K, like OLED, HDR support, Micro LED, quantum dots, or even the newer Micro RGB panel tech. Any of those is likely to have a more dramatic impact on home theaters than moving from 4K to 8K.

With the above-mentioned obstacles, many technologists foresaw 8K failing to live up to tech companies’ promises. That’s not to say that 8K is dead. You can still buy an 8K TV from Samsung, which has 8K TVs with MSRPs starting at $2,500 (for 65 inches), and LG (until stock runs out). With manufacturers refraining from completely ruling out a return to 8K, it’s possible that 8K TVs will become relevant for enthusiasts or niche use cases for many years. And there are uses for high-resolution displays outside of TVs, like in head-mounted displays.

However, 8K TV options are shrinking. We’re far from the days when companies argued over which had the most “real 8K” TVs. If there is a future where 8K TVs reign, it’s one far from today.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.

Cleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”

Cleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.

“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”

Cleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.

Cleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:

I logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”

I had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.

Cleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.

“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”

Cleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”

We contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.

Federal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.

“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.

ICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.

Although Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.

“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve come across video after video of humanoid robots performing backflips, delivering punches — and even a clip of a robot kicking the CEO of its maker squarely in the chest.

Don’t get us wrong, the aerobatics on display are impressive — but it’s not hugely practical, since it’s not like we’re being swarmed by waves of armed bad guys on a daily basis.

Fortunately, not every robotics maker is doubling down on martial arts. Case in point, California-based company Figure recently introduced the second iteration of its humanoid robot AI software, called Helix 02. In a video released this week, the company’s black-and-white android, dubbed Figure 02, can be seen seamlessly unloading a dishwasher and placing clean dishes in upper cabinets and drawers before loading dirty dishes back into it.

It’s an impressive demo. Certain human-like flourishes highlight how Helix 02 was relying on motion-captured training data, from using its foot to kick up the opened dishwasher door to bumping a drawer closed with its hip.

The company claims in a press release that a “single neural system” can control the “full body directly from pixels, enabling dexterous, long horizon autonomy across an entire room.”

The dishwasher demonstration is a “four-minute, end-to-end autonomous task that integrates walking, manipulation, and balance with no resets and no human intervention,” per Figure. “We believe this is the longest horizon, most complex task completed autonomously by a humanoid robot to date.”

Helix 02’s dishwasher mastery was the result of being trained on over 1,000 hours of “human motion data and sim‑to‑real reinforcement learning,” the company claimed. And it’s not a one-hit wonder: we’ve already seen Figure 02 deftly sort packages at a logistics warehouse, load a washing machine, and even fold laundry.

However, how the robot would fare in a different — and perhaps far messier — kitchen remains to be seen. Flashy tech demos like this one should always be taken with a grain of salt, particularly when they’re meant to convey how robots could one day navigate an unpredictable real-world environment, rather than a carefully set-up and controlled stage.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York City’s mayor isn’t even a month into his term, and he’s already delivering a crushing blow to delivery app companies.

In a bombshell intervention, Zohran Mamdani and Department of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner Sam Levine announced that three delivery apps will be forced to repay $4.6 million in wages held back from deliveristas, New York City’s app-based delivery workers.

According to NYC Streetblog, the three main culprits being forced to settle are Uber Eats, Fantuan, and Hungry Panda. The three settlements were the result of a sweeping investigation into broader delivery app practices, which included GrubHub and DoorDash.

“The era of giant corporations juicing profits by underpaying workers is over,” Levine said in a statement. “I’m proud that this agency is not only returning full back pay, but is recovering damages and penalties to send a strong message that cheating workers will not be tolerated.”

Per the mayoral administration, Uber Eats unfairly deactivated and underpaid thousands of workers between December 4, 2023, and September 2, 2024. It’s now being forced to pay $3,150,000 in worker relief penalties across over 48,000 workers, in amounts ranging from $8.79 to $276.15.

In addition, Uber Eats will have to pay the city of New York $350,000 in civil fines — a drop in the bucket compared to the $13.7 billion in revenue the company brought in throughout 2024, but a win for the worker-friendly administration all the same.

The decision strikes a major blow to an industry that has historically relied on its political and financial largess to avoid consequences for horrifying worker abuses resulting from algorithmic management systems.

“For years, app companies treated the law as optional — hiding behind algorithms, stealing wages, and deactivating workers without consequence,” Ligia Guallpa, executive director of the Workers’ Justice Project, told NYC Streetblog in a statement. “The scale of these abuses proves what deliveristas have been saying for years: exploitation is not an accident — it’s baked into the app delivery business model.”

James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School, concurred.

“For far too long, delivery and other online labor platform companies have not only underpaid workers, but deactivated them with abandon, denying workers the ability to make a living,” he said.

Perhaps surprisingly, Uber hasn’t denied any wrongdoing and went as far as to thank officials for bringing light to the issue.

In a statement to NYC Streetblog, Uber spokesman Josh Gold said that “we’re glad to have this resolved.”

“After DCWP notified us of the issue in August 2024, we immediately corrected it, agreed to pay more than the amount owed, and appreciate the new administration moving quickly to bring this to a fair conclusion,” he said.

            <h2>New Study Examines How Often AI Psychosis Actually Happens, and the Results Are Not Good</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve seen plenty of evidence suggesting that prolonged use of popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT can coax some users into spirals of paranoid and delusional behavior.

The phenomenon, dubbed “AI psychosis,” is a very real problem, with researchers warning of a huge wave of severe mental health crises brought on by the tech. In extreme cases, especially involving people with pre-existing conditions, the breaks with reality have even been linked suicides and murder.

Now, thanks to a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper published by researchers at Anthropic and the University of Toronto, we’re beginning to grasp just how widespread the issue really is.

The researchers set out to quantify patterns of what they called “user disempowerment” in “real-world [large language model] usage” — including what they call “reality distortion,” “belief distortion,” and “action distortion” to denote a range of situations in which AI twists users’ sense of reality, beliefs, or pushes them into taking actions.

The results tell a damning story. The researchers found that one in 1,300 conversations out of almost 1.5 million analyzed chats with Anthropic’s Claude led to reality distortion, and one in 6,000 conversations led to action distortion.

To come to their conclusion, the researchers ran 1.5 million Claude conversations through an analysis tool called Clio to identify instances of “disempowerment.”

On the face, that may not sound like a huge proportion given the scale of the much larger dataset — but in absolute numbers, the research highlights a phenomenon that’s affecting huge numbers of people.

“We find the rates of severe disempowerment potential are relatively low,” the researchers concluded. “For instance, severe reality distortion potential, the most common severe-level primitive, occurs in fewer than one in every thousand conversations.”

“Nevertheless, given the scale of AI usage, even these low rates translate to meaningful absolute numbers,” they added. “Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.”

Worse yet, they found evidence that the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment increased between late 2024 and late 2025, indicating that the problem is growing as AI use spreads.

“As exposure grows, users might become more comfortable discussing vulnerable topics or seeking advice,” the researchers wrote in the blog post.

Additionally, the team found that user feedback — in the form of an optional thumbs up or down button at the end of a given conversation with Claude — indicated that users “rate potentially disempowering interactions more favorably,” according to an accompanying blog post on Anthropic’s website.

In other words, users are more likely to come away satisfied when their reality or beliefs are being distorted, highlighting the role of sycophancy, or the strong tendency of AI chatbots to validate a user’s feelings and beliefs.

Plenty of fundamental questions remain. The researchers were upfront about admitting that they “can’t pinpoint why” the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment potential is growing. Their dataset is also limited to Claude consumer traffic, “which limits generalizability.” We also don’t know how many of these identified cases led to real-world harm, as the research only focused on “disempowerment potential” and not “confirmed harm.”

The team called for improved “user education” to make sure people aren’t giving up their full judgment to AI as “model-side interventions are unlikely to fully address the problem.”

Nonetheless, the researchers say the research is only a “first step” to learn how “AI might undermine human agency.”

“We can only address these patterns if we can measure them,” they argued.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, the cultivated meat industry has struggled to emerge as a practical alternative to the brutal factory farming sector. The key reason? Perhaps not that lab grown meat isn’t a viable product, but that intense regulations have strangled it in the cradle.

A new analysis by the food industry publication Just Food found that the majority of cultivated meat companies — those working to bring cell-cultured meat to market — have struggled thanks to a lack of regulatory approvals from government food agencies. Despite a ton of early investor interest in these kinds of companies and an increasingly competitive price point, many are being forced to shutter operations before they can get a product to shelves.

“While it’s disappointing to see company closures, as with any highly innovative sector, not all companies will make it through the tough early stages,” Carlotte Lucas, industry head at Good Food Institute Europe told Just Food.

“However, regulatory inefficiencies, such as longer, unpredictable approval times, have been a critical barrier for companies hoping to bring products to market and have led to some start-ups considering other regions or even relocating overseas,” Lucas continued.

Without regulatory approval in regions like Europe and North America, lab-grown meat startups can’t scale their operations into the kinds of consumer markets that have expressed interest in alternative meats. Instead, they tend to find niche buyers in the restaurant industry, with mixed success.

“While the regulatory work is essential, it’s very resource intensive, it’s very time intensive, and each player needs to go through that process,” Erika Georget, managing director of The Cultured Hub told Just Food.

Georget suggests that scaling up biomass production is essential for success in the lab-grown meat industry — biomass referring to the animal cells utilized in growing cultivated meat. It puts lab-grown meat companies in a paradoxical bind: startups need regulatory approval to scale commercially, but also need commercial scale to survive the regulatory process.

“Even for those that have had approval for restaurants and so on, a challenge is that companies don’t have enough quantity yet to really serve a classical retail business and at an acceptable cost based on pure biomass,” Georget told the outlet.

Until regulators create clearer, faster pathways to approval, cultivated meat risks becoming a cautionary tale of urgently-needed innovation killed by bureaucratic overreach.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple says their Tesla Cybertruck nearly dumped their baby onto the side of the highway after its passenger door latch failed, The Oaklandside reports.

The husband, Oakland resident Viral Shah, says he and his wife were driving up a ramp to get on the highway when the back passenger door next to their one-year-old child suddenly swung open. Shah and his wife screamed and immediately pulled over to check on their kid. Fortunately, the car seat saved the baby from being flung out the car, but it was an alarmingly close call. And had the 60-pound stainless steel-clad door swung back closed, it could have smashed the child’s hand or arm.

If anyone had been sitting back there without a seatbelt, Shah told The Oaklandside, “they would’ve been mush on the street.” His wife had to take the child’s seat, buckle herself in, and hold the door closed for the rest of the drive home. ​​”This is f*cking nuts,” she said, Shah recalled.

Upon inspecting the passenger door, Shah discovered that the metal loop that the car door latch hooked into, called a striker, was missing one of its two screws and had come loose. He also found that the driver door had a screw loose as well. Alarmed, he submitted a complaint to the National High Traffic Safety Administration.

“That’s what made me really scared and furious, because this wasn’t a simple defect,” he told The Oaklandside. “This wasn’t an oversight with one thing where shit happens. This was a systemic design flaw that was affecting those two doors because they were the most heavily used.”

“There’s no doubt in my mind the same thing would happen to all four doors had they been used with the same level of frequency,” he added.

An expert who reviewed photos and videos taken by Shah and his wife suspected that the “weld-nuts” on the backside of the door’s steel pillar appeared to improperly welded, gradually dislodging as the doors were shut.

“This should never, ever happen, but weld-nuts do occasionally break free if there is a process or setup error in the welding equipment or if protective coatings that are used to limit corrosion during shipping of parts are not properly cleaned,” Sam Abuelsamid, a car engineer and vice president of market research at Telemetry, told Oaklandside.

The Cybertruck has been recalled a staggering ten times, a number that probably flatters the vehicle, as it has been accused of all kinds of serious reliability issues beyond those that became official record. Many of the recalls, in any case, were pretty serious. One was for its accelerator pedal getting stuck in the down position, and another was for losing power while driving. It’s also been recalled for other body-related issues, including its stainless steel panels flying off because they were adhered with crummy glue.

The latches aren’t the only apparent issue. Other aspects of the electric doors, which do not have a traditional handle, have been criticized for being unsafe. The doors are operated by a push button from both the outside and inside, systems that can easily fail in an accident. And critics say its emergency release mechanisms are too hidden and impractical. In 2024, three recent high school graduates died after being trapped in a Cybertruck that crashed and caught fire. A bystander at the scene tried to let them free, but couldn’t open the electric doors after the buttons failed.

Shah said that after his incident, he took the vehicle to a Tesla service center, which admitted on an invoice that the rear passenger door was “damaged due to a loose striker.” Tesla offered to buy back the vehicle for nearly its full purchase price, so long as he agreed not to sue the automaker. He took the offer.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How the most massive objects in the universe first formed is one of the biggest headscratchers in astrophysics. With more advanced telescopes, astronomers have found fully formed galaxies and colossal black holes earlier and earlier in the cosmos, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. This shouldn’t be enough time for these structures to reach their incredible size; to astronomers, it’s like stumbling on a fully-grown oak tree that’s only a year old.

The dilemma was put into hyperdrive by the James Webb Space Telescope’s discovery of extremely bright “Little Red Dots” that were present when the universe was less than a billion years old, and are nowhere to be seen today. Though they’re suspected to be some kind of compact galaxy, they would be almost impossibly dense at the mass they appear to have, wall-to-wall with stars, according to Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of a new study investigating the red objects published in the journal Nature.

“They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing,” he told Ars Technica. “Galaxies cannot produce stars at more than 20 percent efficiency, at least that’s what our current knowledge is.”

Another proposed explanation is that they’re some kind of supermassive black hole. But this, too, is fraught: the red dots show no signs of the x-ray emissions produced by these objects. And if they were black holes, they would be “overmassive,” weighing nearly as much as their entire surrounding galaxy, something that’s never been observed in a conventional galaxy. How such an enormous monstrosity could form when the universe was still in its infancy is equally baffling.

Thankfully, there may be a very tidy explanation. In his study, Rusakov and his team found that the gasses observed in the Little Red Dots, which astronomers use to infer the mass of invisible black holes, weren’t moving as quickly as once thought. If so, that means that the black holes are around 100 times less massive than previously estimated.

The upshot is that the supposedly “overmassive” behemoths are actually just young supermassive black holes. But if that’s the case, why don’t they resemble any black holes that we’re seeing today? The astronomers suggests that we may be witnessing a previously unknown “cocoon” stage of their evolution, during which they feed off of a dense, protective shell of ionized gas.

“They look like a [developing] butterfly or something in this young state that kind of grows wrapped in some sort of gas that also feeds it,” Rusakov told Ars. “It’s definitely new in the sense people didn’t predict there should be such a cocoon phase in the supermassive black holes’ lifecycle.”

In addition to feeding the black hole, the cocoon would also block the x-ray emissions we would expect to see, explaining their absence.

It’s probably one of the tidiest solutions out there to the Little Red Dots mystery, though there are more than a few. Other research suggests that they’re galaxies which are unusually tiny because they haven’t spun up to speed. An even bolder hypothesis proposes they’re “black hole stars” consisting of a black hole core surrounded by a sphere of gas so dense that it resembles the outer layers of a star. But if Rusakov and his team are on the right track, it raises another significant question that’s been haunting astronomers. “Does the galaxy start with the supermassive black hole or with the stars?” Rusakov pondered. “Is that a chicken or the egg?”

“We don’t know exactly what happens in this first sort of stage of galaxy formation,” he added. “But our model gives us a new way to look at this kind of object.

In our mature cosmos, black holes are formed from the collapse of dying star, but in the earliest moments of its existence, the extreme conditions may have given birth to these objects all around, long before the first stars would be born.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Melania,” a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, is exceeding box office expectations, with Sunday estimates suggesting it will make $7.04 million on its opening weekend.

The documentary is coming in third overall for the weekend, behind the Sam Raimi-directed thriller “Send Help” ($20 million) and “Iron Lung” ($17.8 million), a video game adaptation from YouTuber Mark Fischbach (better known as Markiplier).

Amazon paid $40 million to acquire “Melania” and is reportedly spending $35 million to promote it. So even though the documentary is outperforming pre-release estimates predicting a $3 to $5 million opening weekend, it’s unlikely to make a profit in theaters.

Amazon’s bid came in $26 million ahead of the next highest bidder, Disney, leading critics to suggest the deal had less to do with the film’s box office potential and more with winning over the Trump administration. Veteran film executive Ted Hope, who worked at Amazon from 2015 to 2020, told The New York Times that the film “has to be the most expensive documentary ever made that didn’t involve music licensing.”

“How can it not be equated with currying favor or an outright bribe?” Hope said. “How can that not be the case?”

This is the first film directed by Brett Ratner since 2017, when multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and misconduct. (Ratner has denied those accusations.) Rolling Stone reports that two-thirds of the film’s New York crew asked not to be formally credited in the film.

While Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a preview screening of “Melania” at the White House last weekend “Melania” was not screened in advance for critics, and the subsequent reviews have been brutal. The documentary currently sits at 7% on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating “overwhelming dislike,” and at 10% on Rotten Tomatoes.

New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis described it as “a very circumscribed and carefully stage-managed chronicle of Mrs. Trump’s day-to-day life” during the 20 days before President Trump’s 2025 inauguration.

In a statement, Amazon MGM’s head of domestic theatrical distribution Kevin Wilson described this weekend as “an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series,” which he predicted will have a “significant life” on Amazon’s Prime streaming service.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Indonesia has followed Malaysia and the Philippines in lifting a ban on xAI’s chatbot Grok.

The Southeast Asian countries banned Grok after it was used to create a flood of nonconsensual, sexualized imagery on X (now a subsidiary of xAI), including images of real women and minors. In late December and January, Grok was used to create at least 1.8 million sexualized images of women, according to separate analyses by The New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

In a statement, Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs said that it was lifting the ban after X sent a letter “outlining concrete steps for service improvements and the prevention of misuse” (translation via The New York Times).

Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space monitoring, said the ban is only being lifted “conditionally” and could be reinstated if “further violations are discovered.”

Malaysia and the Philippines lifted their bans on January 23.

Grok’s deepfakes have spurred criticism and investigations — but only a few outright bans — from governments around the world. In the United States, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office was investigating xAI and had sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the company to take immediate action to end the production of these images.

xAI appears to have taken some steps to restrict Grok’s capabilities, including limiting its AI image generation feature to paying subscribers on X. CEO Elon Musk has insisted, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” and said he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.”

Documents released by the Justice Department on Friday around the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein include at least 16 emails between Musk and Epstein in 2012 and 2013, with Musk asking to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island and wondering about the “wildest party on your island.” Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution in 2008.

xAI, meanwhile, is reportedly in talks to merge with two of Musk’s other companies, SpaceX and Tesla, ahead of a SpaceX IPO.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has spent months — years? — trying to position his company as something more than just a maker of electric vehicles. When Tesla acquired Solar City in 2016, he (and his comms team) pitched it as a sustainable energy company. Over the past year, he has pushed the idea of Tesla as an AI and robotics company.

Musk’s aspirational branding has slammed right up against financial reality: The bulk of its revenue comes from selling EVs. Its latest earnings support this.

The company generated $94.8 billion in revenue in 2025. Of that, $69.5 billion came from selling and leasing EVs as well as related regulatory credits. The remaining $25 billion is split nearly down the middle between its energy generation (solar) and storage business and “services and other,” which include revenue from its Superchargers, parts sales, and Full Self-Driving subscriptions. That reliance on deliveries means that as EV sales have dipped, so has Tesla’s entire balance sheet. Its profits in 2025 were 46% lower year-over-year.

Tesla has tried to grow its non-EV businesses to compensate for the decline in sales, and its Q4 and full-year earnings report (and its accompanying call) signaled a shift beyond the persistent AI-robotics talk and toward action. For now, that action involves spending money, not making it. Musk repeatedly stressed that 2026 would be a huge CapEx year, more than doubling spending to $20 billion, which would put them in negative-cash-flow territory.

For instance, Musk announced that Tesla is ending production of the Model S and Model X, which is more symbolic than material. Those two models represent about 2% of Tesla’s sales volume, a point that Barclays analyst Dan Levy also makes in his most recent note. Still, it is a notable end-of-an-era moment for Tesla and the broader automotive industry, which was forever changed when the Model S went on sale in 2012.

The more material move is what Tesla plans to do now.

Tesla plans to fill the production void left by the Model S and X with its Optimus humanoid robots, which will be made at its Fremont, California, factory. Musk also intends to scale Tesla’s robotaxi operations to more cities in 2026 and even floated the need for Tesla to build a TerraFab factory to shore up chip supply.

But the item that really stood out to me — and a true Elon Inc circular economy deal — was Tesla’s plan to invest $2 billion into another Musk company, xAI, and signaled plans to more closely align those two companies. Meanwhile, other outlets are reporting talks are underway to possibly merge (in some combination) three of Musk’s companies: SpaceX, Tesla, and xAI.

But let’s come back down to earth for a moment and review Tesla’s current business. Its sales are down year-over-year, while its smaller energy storage business made positive gains.

We’re not quite ready to share the full details, but we’ve heard from one little bird that there is some activity on the fundraising front for Waymo. You probably saw reporting last month about Waymo raising up to a $15 billion round led by its parent company Alphabet. Based on my conversations, it is still in “the realm” of $15 billion and large portion is coming from Alphabet, and there is high interest from external investors to join. One little bird told me one of the other investors may be an OEM (original equipment manufacturer.

Waabi gets my “deal of the week” badge — and not just because of the dollar figures attached. The autonomous vehicle startup has raised $750 million in a Series C round co-led by Khosla Ventures and G2 Venture Partners, plus another $250 million in milestone capital from Uber to support the deployment of 25,000 or more Waabi Driver-powered robotaxis exclusively on its platform.

Uber is already a Waabi backer, participating in one of its earliest raises in 2021. But this is about more than money. When Waabi first launched, it focused on applying its autonomous vehicle tech to self-driving trucks. The deal with Uber is a declaration that it intends to scale its tech across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack.

Can Waabi do it? Others have tried and retreated. Waymo shuttered its self-driving trucks program to focus on robotaxis; Aurora, which is also an investor in Waabi, was working on both trucks and robotaxis, too, before deciding to focus just on big rigs.

Gatik AI, a startup developing autonomous trucks focused on the “middle mile,” has signed a deal with a major (unnamed) consumer-goods company. Here’s why it matters: The contract will deliver $600 million in revenue over five years. And these are for driverless transport, meaning no safety driver is behind the wheel. These Gatik trucks, which run 24 hours a day moving ambient, refrigerated, and frozen goods between distribution centers and stores, have been operating driverlessly since mid-2025. According to the company, it has completed 60,000 fully driverless orders without incident.

Luminar’s lidar business has been sold for $33 million to Redmond, Washington-based MicroVision. The company, which is developing its own sensors, beat out Quantum Computing in an auction for the assets. TC’s Sean O’Kane interviewed MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos about his plans for Luminar. The sales process did have a bit of last-minute intrigue when a mystery bidder, with a far larger offer, made a play for Luminar’s lidar business.

Rad Power Bikes, which started the bankruptcy process about a month ago, reached a deal to sell itself to Life Electric Vehicles Holdings (or Life EV) for around $13.2 million. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million. History lesson: Rad Power has raised $329.2 million since its founding and once had a valuation of $1.65 billion.

Redwood Materials raised $425 million in a Series E round that includes Google as a new investor. The round was led by venture firm Eclipse and includes a strategic investment by Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures, as well as existing investors Capricorn and Goldman Sachs. Read the full story to learn what Redwood plans to do with the capital.

Obi, a company that aggregates real-time pricing and pickup times across multiple ride-hailing services, shared new data on ride-hailing and robotaxis in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are a few takeaways — so please go read the full story — including that the price gap between Waymo and rides provided by Uber and Lyft is narrowing.

Uber launched a new division called Uber AV Labs, that is not — as senior reporter Sean O’Kane points out — a ploy to start developing its own robotaxis again. This is a data-sharing play; sensor-equipped Uber cars will collect and then share data with partners like Lucid, Waymo, and Waabi. Important note: No contracts are signed yet.

Waymo is now allowed to operate a robotaxi service to and from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The company will begin offering access to SFO to a select number of riders before offering it to all customers in the coming months. That win comes with a bit of tarnish, however. Waymo is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board after the company reported one of its robotaxis struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica on January 23.

The San Francisco Police Departmentis investigating an incident involving a Zoox autonomous vehicle that crashed into the driver’s-side door of a parked car.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/india-offers-zero-taxes-through-2047-to-lure-global-ai-workloads/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the global race to build AI infrastructure accelerates, India has offered foreign cloud providers zero taxes through 2047 on services sold outside the country if they run those workloads from Indian data centers — a bid to attract the next wave of AI computing investment, even as power shortages and water stress threaten expansion in the South Asian nation.

On Sunday, India’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced (PDF) the proposal in the country’s annual budget, offering a tax holiday — effectively zero taxes — on revenues from cloud services sold outside India if those services are run from data centers in the country. Sales to Indian customers would have to be routed through locally incorporated resellers and taxed domestically, she told parliament. The budget also proposes a 15% cost-plus safe harbour for Indian data-center operators providing services to related foreign entities.

The announcement comes as U.S. cloud giants including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to add data-center capacity worldwide to support the surge in artificial-intelligence workloads, with India emerging as an increasingly attractive location for new investment. The country offers a large pool of engineering talent and growing demand for cloud services, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia for expanding compute infrastructure.

In October, Google said it would invest $15 billion to build an AI hub and expand data-center infrastructure in India, its largest commitment in the country to date, following a $10 billion commitment in 2020. Microsoft followed in December with plans to invest $17.5 billion by 2029 to expand its AI and cloud footprint, funding new data centers, infrastructure, and training programs. Amazon has also stepped up its spending in December, saying it would invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations.

India’s domestic data-center sector is also ramping up to meet global demand. In November, Digital Connexion, a joint venture backed by Reliance Industries, Brookfield Asset Management, and Digital Realty Trust, said it would invest $11 billion by 2030 to develop a 1-gigawatt, AI-focused data center campus in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The project, spanning about 400 acres in Visakhapatnam, is among the largest announced in India and underscores growing interest from both domestic and global investors in building AI-ready infrastructure in the country. Separately, Adani Group said in December it plans to invest up to $5 billion alongside Google in its AI data center project in the country.

However, scaling up data center capacity in India may prove difficult, as patchy power availability, high electricity costs, and water scarcity pose key constraints for energy-intensive AI workloads. Those challenges could slow construction and raise operating costs for cloud providers.

“The announcements on data centers signal that they are being treated as a strategic business sector rather than just back-end infrastructure,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner of New Delhi-based The Quantum Hub, a public policy and tech consulting firm. The push is likely to attract more private investment and strengthen India’s position as a regional data and compute hub, though execution challenges around power availability, land access, and state-level clearances remain, he added.

Sagar Vishnoi, co-founder and director of Noida-based think tank Future Shift Labs, said India’s data-center power capacity is projected to surpass 2 gigawatts by 2026, up from just over 1 gigawatt currently, and could expand more than fivefold to exceed 8 gigawatts by 2030, driven by capital investments of more than $30 billion. While the budget signals clear intent to accelerate digital infrastructure and cloud computing, Vishnoi said allowing foreign cloud firms to earn profits tax-free until 2047 reflects a “strategic bet on global Big Tech,” even as India could produce its own technology champions over the next two decades.

He added that routing services to Indian users through reseller entities could leave smaller domestic players competing for thin margins, rather than receiving comparable upstream incentives.

The federal budget also stepped up incentives to deepen India’s role in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, as the country seeks to move beyond assembly and capture more value in global supply chains. The federal government would launch a second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission, the finance minister said, focused on producing equipment and materials, developing full-stack domestic chip intellectual property, and strengthening supply chains, while backing industry-led research and training centers to build a skilled workforce.

Additionally, the Indian government has raised the outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹400 billion (around $4.36 billion), from ₹229.19 billion (about $2.50 billion), after the program — launched in April 2025 — attracted investment commitments at more than double its original target, Sitharaman said.

This scheme offers incentives tied to incremental production and investment, reimbursing a portion of costs for companies that manufacture key components such as printed circuit boards, camera modules, connectors, and other parts used in smartphones, servers, and data-center hardware. By linking payouts to actual output rather than upfront subsidies, the program is designed to draw global suppliers deeper into India’s electronics supply chain and reduce reliance on imported components — a long-standing criticism of the country’s manufacturing push.

Alongside increasing the spending allocation for the electronics components scheme, the federal budget also proposed a five-year tax exemption starting in April for foreign companies supplying equipment and tooling to electronics toll manufacturers operating in bonded zones. The change is likely to benefit companies including Apple, which relies heavily on contract manufacturing in India and has previously been reported to have sought clarity from New Delhi on the tax treatment of high-end iPhone production equipment supplied to its partners.

The budget also sought to address vulnerabilities in critical minerals, as India grapples with tightening global supplies of rare earth materials used in electric vehicles, electronics devices, and defense systems. The finance minister said the federal government would support mineral-rich states including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu in establishing dedicated rare-earth corridors to promote mining, processing, research, and manufacturing. The move builds on a seven-year incentive program approved in late 2025 to boost domestic production of rare-earth magnets, as access to supplies from China — which dominates global output — has become more constrained.

Beyond AI infrastructure and electronics manufacturing, the Indian government also moved to boost cross-border e-commerce, aiming to help smaller businesses tap global demand. The finance minister said the existing ₹1 million (around $11,000) value cap per consignment on courier exports would be removed, a move expected to benefit small manufacturers, artisans, and startups selling overseas through online platforms. The federal government would streamline the handling of rejected and returned shipments using technology, addressing a long-standing bottleneck for exporters, Sitharaman said.

Overall, the latest measures emphasize India’s ambition to position itself as a long-term hub for global technology infrastructure, spanning cloud computing, electronics manufacturing, and critical minerals. The strategy aims to capitalize on surging AI demand and shifting supply chains. Nonetheless, its success will hinge on execution — from reliable power and water for data centers to sustained support for domestic innovation — as global companies and investors weigh whether India can translate policy incentives into durable leadership in the AI era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Aerospace, energy, healthcare, mobility, and media. Thirty years ago, we’d be talking about General Electric. Today, we’re talking about Elon Musk. He’s the CEO of Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX, which also owns the telecoms company Starlink. He owns the social media platform X. He’s developing neural implants and underground tunnels. He’s put at least $10 million behind fertility research.

Musk also appears to be merging several of these ventures into one conglomerate.

Musk has frequently been likened to Henry Ford. A more apt comparison might be to John D. Rockefeller or Jack Welch, who took GE from an ailing industrial company into a sprawling conglomerate.

The Welch comparison could turn out to be particularly valid if Musk follows through on rumors that he’s trying to merge some combination of SpaceX, xAI and Tesla.

The similarities aren’t all encompassing, of course. GE was a company, and Musk is a person. But the distinction can get a bit blurry in an era when his net worth eclipses the market cap of 97% of the S&P 500. In fact, Musk’s net worth is approaching $800 billion, almost as much as GE at its peak when adjusted for inflation.

At its height, GE was often inseparable from its chairman, Jack Welch.

Musk, the individual, captivates many of his peers, just like Welch did. Executives today talk of being “hardcore” and espouse “first-principles thinking,” just like CEOs of the 1980s sought to emulate Welch through “accretive” mergers and mass layoffs.

Today, Musk’s empire spans Tesla, SpaceX, xAI (including with X), Neuralink, and The Boring Company, all companies with very different goals. Sure, Teslas drive through The Boring Company’s holes, xAI’s Grok is available in the automaker’s vehicles, and Tesla has supplied its Megapack batteries to xAI’s data centers. But apart from sharing Musk’s ownership or leadership, they’ve had limited interaction with each other until recently, when Tesla and SpaceX separately invested in xAI.

At one time, not so long ago, GE was the world’s most valuable company, with divisions that made light bulbs, jet engines, home appliances, X-ray and ultrasound machines, steam turbines, locomotives, and television shows, among dozens of others.

When Welch took the helm of GE in 1981, he inherited a company adrift, having lost a fifth of its market cap in the preceding decade. His first move was to trim headcount. In fact, he laid off so many employees — more than 100,000 in his first few years — that he became known as “Neutron Jack,” an allusion to the neutron bomb, which eliminates people while leaving buildings intact.

With the savings, Welch went out and acquired company after company. Many of them manufactured stuff, similar to GE’s existing businesses. But some, like NBC, which Welch bought in 1986, did not. That one was added to the portfolio to expand the company’s influence. (Sound familiar?)

During his tenure as chairman of GE, Welch was revered for his management abilities, with rival CEOs emulating his management style. The company’s management training program was put on the same pedestal as top business schools, and several of his proteges went on to run Fortune 500 companies themselves. Through a relentless series of layoffs and acquisitions, Welch had turned GE into a money printing machine. The company grew from $14 billion when he took over to over $400 billion when he left in 2001. Shareholder dividends only went up.

But Welch’s approach wasn’t ironclad. In 2001, his last year at GE, the company’s share price declined. By the time the 2008 financial crisis hit, it was clear that the company’s conglomerate structure was hiding some grievous flaws.

Profits from GE Capital were used to paper over poor performance in other divisions. When it became clear that GE Capital was deep into questionable financial instruments, fractures in the business model widened. GE Capital was ultimately bailed out by the federal government to the tune of $139 billion, but the shine was off. Five years ago, GE announced that it would split itself into three separate companies. The conglomerate was no more.

Aside from Welch, Musk might have another comparison a bit farther back in history, before GE became the prototypical conglomerate. “I think it’s much more of a robber baron story than a GE conglomerate story,” David Yoffie, professor at Harvard Business School, told TechCrunch.

In the Gilded Age, he said, people like J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller controlled large, powerful companies that built new industries like railroads and oil companies. They controlled those firms either directly or through board seats they influenced, and they could mix and match companies as they pleased.

“I think that’s much more the type of approach that Elon is taking,” Yoffie said. “It’s much more about ego, market power, and trying to be the kingmaker.”

Much of the robber barons’ power came from two sources: their tremendous wealth and the lack of regulation at the time.

Wealth disparities have grown similarly large in recent years. John D. Rockefeller’s wealth was equal to a percentage point or two of the United States’ total GDP, about the same as Musk’s today.

“What’s different, of course, is that there was no regulatory framework whatsoever during the period of the Gilded Age,” Yoffie said. “Today, we obviously live in a much more heavily regulated world, but we’re also at the moment living in a world in which regulation is getting pulled back and therefore is less and less of a constraint.”

What ultimately happens to Musk and his empire will depend both on the direction he decides to take things — to merge his companies or keep them separate — and how society responds to his growing power. Musk, like his Gilded Age predecessors, has been attempting to put his thumb on the scales, spending more than $300 million trying to influence elections in the U.S. and abroad.

If Musk ends up merging one or more of his companies, he’ll end up with a true conglomerate, something that’s not in vogue today. Conglomerates in the U.S. emerged as a way for investors to hedge risk by buying shares in one company that has businesses that are counter-cyclical, Yoffie said. If one division hits a rough patch, others can pick up the slack to keep revenue and profit smooth.

“Most of that strategy and approach was debunked in subsequent decades,” he said. Investors tend to do better when they buy shares in more specialized companies, which are able to operate more efficiently. Conglomerates also make it difficult to disentangle the different businesses to accurately determine their value. “It’s well known in finance that there’s a conglomerate discount,” Yoffie said.

Merger talk aside, the biggest constraint on Musk’s companies might be regulation, which is ultimately driven by public opinion. The tycoons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries found their power ultimately checked by a wave of new regulations introduced in the Progressive Era. Musk has a knack for embracing visions of the future that captivate people’s imaginations and translating them into business plans. The question is, how long will he be able to keep it up?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">January was such a long month that it has already brought us five fresh European unicorns: from Belgium to Ukraine, several tech startups raised funding at valuations above the $1 billion threshold.

But before we take a closer look at who joined the club, two caveats.

First: This count includes startups that may be incorporated elsewhere but have their roots or a large part of their team in Europe. Until a pan-European corporate structure exists (often called “EU Inc”), this split will remain common — and we’ve decided to overlook it. Take Lovable, which is incorporated in Delaware but cannot be dissociated from Stockholm’s startup scene.

Second: valuation doesn’t equal commercial success, and it is too early to tell whether all of these companies will achieve the kind of traction that Lovable has, with the company recently crossing $300 million in annual recurring revenue. But in the current climate, the fact that VCs were willing to invest in them at unicorn valuations is a strong signal of where the appetite is.

With these caveats out of the way, let’s dive in.

Belgium-based cybersecurity startup Aikido Security reached unicorn status with its $60 million Series B funding round. Valuing the company at $1 billion, the round was led by DST Global, with participation from PSG Equity, Singular, Notion Capital, and others.

According to a press release, the funding will help Aikido enhance its platform, which was built to unify security across the entire software lifecycle and is already used by more than 100,000 teams globally. The company also reported “five-times revenue growth and nearly three-times customer growth” over the last year.

In a blog post, the startup celebrated this milestone and its significance. According to its team, “in an industry dominated by Palo Alto and Tel Aviv heavyweights, Aikido shows that Europe can build a world-class software security company and win globally.”

Cloud optimization company Cast AI is headquartered in Florida, but has Lithuanian roots and a major office in Vilnius — which explains why many now consider it to have become Lithuania’s fifth unicorn.

Cast AI’s valuation now exceeds $1 billion following a strategic investment from Pacific Alliance Ventures (PAV), the U.S.-based corporate venture arm of Korean conglomerate Shinsegae Group. In April 2025, Cast AI raised a $108 million Series C that had reportedly already brought the company close to unicorn territory.

Alongside its latest funding round, the company also introduced OMNI Compute for AI, which aims to help users deploy more AI workloads on fewer GPUs and remove regional capacity constraints.

French defense tech company Harmattan AI was only founded in 2024, but is already worth $1.4 billion, according to its latest funding round. The $200 million Series B was led by Dassault Aviation, maker of the Rafale fighter jets, and also ties into a broader partnership.

Before securing this key partner, Harmattan AI had already signed agreements with the French and British ministries of defense and with Ukrainian drone maker Skyeton, amid growing appetite for autonomous defense aircraft.

German ESG software firm Osapiens raised a $100 million Series C led by Decarbonization Partners, a joint venture between BlackRock and Temasek, which valued the company at over $1.1 billion.

Founded in Mannheim in 2018, Osapiens now has more than 2,400 customers worldwide, including large multinational companies that rely on its platforms and tools for sustainability reporting and data compliance, but also to mitigate supply chain risks.

The 14-year-old language learning marketplace Preply is now a unicorn valued at $1.2 billion — a milestone that also embodies Ukrainian resilience. The edtech company was founded in the United States, but its founders are Ukrainian and supporters of their home country, where Preply has a team of 150 employees.

According to its CEO, Kirill Bigai, who believes in AI-enhanced learning, proceeds from the $150 million Series D round will help the startup hire more AI talent across its four offices — now located in Barcelona, London, New York, and Kyiv.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On the Saturday night that the storm hit Mississippi, we had dripped our faucets for the temperature drop and stockpiled flashlights, groceries, extra blankets. By 11:30 p.m., my husband was pulling on his rain boots and heading outside to tarp our heating unit: “A branch has already fallen onto a power line in our backyard,” he told me. Three hours later, I was shaken awake. “Mom, I think a tree just fell on our house,” my 13-year-old son said. I stumbled around, looking for any sign that tree branches had breached my home. As I searched, I saw the pine tree behind our home drop a giant branch into the neighbor’s yard.

Crack. Boom. For the next six or so hours, every few minutes, we heard tree branches cracking, encased in ice and barreling to the ground like meteorites, exploding on contact with the earth. At each crack, we thought, Will this be the one that hits our house? Or our neighbors’? Will we lose our giant oak tree? Under the weight of five blankets and three sleeping bags, we waited for the storm to pass, for daylight to break, and for the fate of our town to become clear.

We know warm-weather storms in the South. Tornado sirens and weather alerts send us to shelter in our bathtub from spring into summer, when hurricane season begins and then runs into fall. We rarely get a break, yet something keeps us in place. My family and I live in Water Valley, a small town of about 3,400 in the Hill Country, just under 20 miles from Oxford, where I grew up. As a young child, often surrounded by oaks, pines, sycamores, cedars, and more, I found comfort and beauty in the trees. Many of the old trees in Mississippi have been preserved simply because no one had reason to cut them down. So much of the state is undeveloped, and that has allowed nature to be still and simply continue to live. My childhood house backed up to Bailey’s Woods, which connects the University of Mississippi to Rowan Oak, the home of William Faulkner. I’d build forts hidden deep in the woods or follow a shortcut to campus to get a milkshake from the cafeteria. I knew the trails so well that I could walk home at dusk without a flashlight.

Last Sunday morning, I began to assess the damage. I opened the front door, and the undeniable smell of pine trees hit my son and me in the face. My neighbors, whose home is flanked by pines, were now trapped by them. Their driveway was impassable, with broken branches everywhere. I heard the sound of a chainsaw down the street: Someone was already working to clear downed branches covering the road. A few neighborhood kids had wasted no time and were at the top of the hill in front of my house, hopping on bright green disc sleds, hopeful that the ice on the road would be as fun as snow.

In the backyard, two neighbors were looking up at the pine and its scattered branches. Another neighbor’s fence was now mangled metal covered in tree parts. I saw that we had lost a smaller tree, too, and a pine tree branch had pierced its fallen body, now split in half. When I fed the birds on our deck, as I normally do, I counted as many as 40 birds feasting, having just been displaced from the trees. I decided to feed them twice as much.

My mom, who lives a couple of blocks away, and my friends were all okay. We were among the more than 150,000 homes and businesses in the state without power. With nothing else to do, exhausted from the long night, I went back to sleep under my pile of blankets. This became a new pattern: sleeping more than 12 hours each night, just trying to stay warm, eating dinner at 3:30 or 4 before the sun set and the quiet of the town began. I stayed close to the house, while my husband volunteered overnight at the town warming center.

Our power returned after five and a half days, at 11:30 in the morning. That Thursday was the first day that the count of utility customers without power dropped below 100,000, but only barely. In my town, the Water Valley Electric Commission and its volunteer chairman, Brandon Presley, had worked hard to execute mutual-aid agreements with other municipally owned utilities and to engage private contractors and suppliers before the storm. That diligence paid off, and on Main Street, businesses were quickly up and running, providing us with resources and sustenance. The storm that we just lived through is the type that comes around every few decades, but dealing with dangerous ice here is starting to feel like a new routine. Not so long ago, another ice storm had trapped us atop our slippery hill. My neighbors are discussing their lists of winter needs for the future: ice cleats, hand warmers, a good pair of gloves, a snow shovel, a power bank, a camping stove.

Even if they are rare, storms like these teach us what we can tolerate. I lived in Memphis during the summer storm of 2003—a derecho that was affectionately called Hurricane Elvis. For 10 long days, I had no air-conditioning in 90-plus degrees, and I thought that was the worst I could feel, living in air so thick you’d think you could cut it with a knife. Winter Storm Fern changed my mind. Losing power in the cold, living in air so frigid I could see my breath inside my home, is much worse than the heat.

As of Friday, almost a week after the storm, tens of thousands of households still didn’t have power. Some families, in the more rural parts of an already rural state, have no idea how long the wait will be for their power to return. In my neighborhood, a warmer day melted some of the snow and ice away on the roads, but cold has set in again, and this weekend, temperatures dropped below freezing. I thought I might have a level of resilience to endure that kind of challenge, but I quickly learned that I really don’t.

The trees have their own kind of resilience, and they, too, will return—although that will take much longer than the power. Whereas pines grow relatively fast, oaks are slower. Thankfully, our 133-year-old oak tree was spared and will, I hope, continue to be a towering beacon, reminding us of the beauty of trees but also of the danger they can quickly create during storms. Especially when they’re covered in ice.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the pleasures of watching Ilia Malinin, apart from his indifference to gravity, is to witness him becoming. Becoming a world champion, as opposed to a juvenile with a skate-park mentality and a face like a Disney prince. Becoming a master of quadruple jumps that no one else can land, rising with all the ease of a young Michael Jordan—before landing on a pair of butcher knives, on ice.

Sometimes there are evolutionary leaps in sport, the arrival of athletes so physically dynamic, they widen the eyes with incredulity: the gymnast Simone Biles thundering in the air, the swimmer Michael Phelps coursing through the water with a wake like an attack boat’s. Malinin is one of these. In December, while refining his routine for his first Olympic Games, in Milan, the 21-year-old figure skater landed seven quadruple jumps in competition, spinning like a weather vane in a windstorm. No other competitor landed more than four.

In a sport in which medals can be determined by fractions of a point, Malinin wins by 30, 40, sometimes even 70 points, and he does so with style, sliding on his knees and cartwheeling on one hand to medleys of classical cello mixed with Gen Z electronic power bass. His signature is a quadruple axel—a jump that only he has ever successfully completed in competition, earning him his self-styled nickname, the “Quad God.” Late in his routines, he likes to toss off one more maneuver, just to commence the crowd-roar: He high-kicks his skates over his head into a backflip, and lands on one foot.

Malinin’s confidence would be insolent if his acrobatics weren’t so astonishing. “I broke physics,” he told me recently, only half-kidding during a conversation in the back hall of a practice rink in Leesburg, Virginia. “Now I think physics doesn’t apply to me.” He stood 5 foot 8 and 140 pounds in shapeless sweats and Nikes, his pale triangle of a face topped by flaxen hair. He did not yet have his own car. He was waiting for his dad to pick him up.

The first quadruple jump of any kind was landed in 1988 by a Canadian champion named Kurt Browning, but it was a one-off. Quads wouldn’t be performed consistently until about 15 years later, after an American named Timothy Goebel became the first man to hit three in a single program, in 1999, and did so again to win a bronze in the 2002 Winter Games, earning the nickname “Quad King.” By the mid-2000s, doing one or more quads was practically a necessity, because they were scored almost twice as high as triples. Quads became part of everyone’s repertoire, with five different varieties and degrees of difficulty: the toe loop (worth up to 9.5 points), salchow (9.7), loop (10.5), flip (11), and lutz (11.5).

But one particular quad jump was so demanding that even the most elite champions could not perform it: the axel, valued at 12.5 points. To the casual viewer, most jumps are indistinguishable from one another, but anyone can detect an axel, because it’s the sole jump that requires the skater to take off facing forward, then execute a blind backward landing, on the opposite foot. The skater actually rotates four and a half times, in less than a second. As of 2021, only one man had even tried a quad axel in competition: The 27-year-old Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan went for it in his country’s national championships that year, but he under-rotated and two-footed his landing.

Malinin landed it smoothly in 2022, when he was 17.

He was a skinny-chested boy who had just begun competing in major international events, and he knew that the entire skating world considered it nearly impossible. The word provokes him. “It just screams ‘I’m possible,’ ” he said, as he walked through the hall of the practice rink and grabbed a snack of Auntie Anne’s pretzel bites.

Malinin has a typical 21-year-old’s crush on profundity; his long program, titled “A Voice,” opens with his own voice narrating a series of pontifical maxims, such as “Begin where light no longer reaches, where no path has yet been made.” If he can sound sophomoric, well, he is a sophomore, enrolled at George Mason University. But a mature, obsessive work ethic turns his big ideas into big jumps and one-of-a-kind routines. “If I find a passion for something, I will really get down to just hammering away at it, until I get it,” he said.

Once Malinin gets it, the next boundary comes into view. One quad axel? Well then, how about two in a row?

To fully appreciate how revolutionary Malinin is, consider some fundamental physics and biomechanics. The gold-medal-determining long program, also known as the “free skate,” lasts for four and a half minutes. Roughly 30 seconds in, Malinin’s heart rate rises to 90 percent of its capacity, about 180 beats a minute, and stays there for the duration. The effort is comparable to that sustained by the world’s fastest milers.

Wearing carbon-composite skates that weigh about two pounds each, Malinin reaches a vertical leap of approximately 30 inches on his quad axel—one kinematic study captured it at 33 inches, similar to the standing vertical leaps of NBA players such as Stephen Curry, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant. He lands on a blade that is just 3/16 of an inch wide.

Malinin enters the jump skating at about 15 miles an hour. As he snaps into his shoulder turn, he draws his arms and legs inward, creating a spin. At this stage, he experiences at least 180 pounds of centripetal force. By way of comparison, a NASCAR driver rounding a corner will experience about 400 pounds of centripetal force, while wearing a seat belt. As he reaches his apex, Malinin is spinning at 350 revolutions per minute. This is about the same as a kitchen stand mixer or the marine engine of an oil tanker.

A human being turning at such a rate experiences serious disorientation. Somehow, Malinin must find a way of “undizzying” himself, as Goebel told me. Skaters do this by spotting certain visual markers in the rink, but they don’t always succeed in reorienting. Once, after completing one routine, Goebel nearly skated into the Zamboni tunnel by mistake.

As Malinin comes out of his spin, his backward boot strikes the ice with a landing force between five and eight times his body weight, or upwards of 700 pounds. In other sports, athletes distribute shocks to both feet, in soft shoes or on forgiving surfaces. “He’s going to land on one foot,” on a sheet of ice atop concrete, Deborah King, a biomechanics professor at Ithaca College, told me. Adding to the stress on his leg, she said, is the rotational energy he’ll need to stop so he can glide out of his landing.

Still, none of this captures the totality of Malinin’s performances. There are spins, jumps into spins, jumps out of spins, fast steps, crossovers, rapid changes from inside to outside edge. Even a single misstep or break in a leg line will be marked down by the judges. “You know, when you kick a soccer ball, you don’t have to look perfect,” Malinin said. “You don’t have to point your toe.”

Malinin spends up to six hours a day on the ice, in morning and afternoon sessions, rehearsing his footwork and doing as many as 50 jumps, six days a week. “Your whole body dies at the end of the day,” he said.

Malinin was merely on the threshold of public awareness late last year, as the Olympics approached, but seemed ripe for a “holy shit” audience moment. Only in the past few months has he begun to get endorsement deals with big companies—Xfinity, Coca-Cola, Google, Honda. “At first it was like, Who? ” Sheryl Shade, Malinin’s co-agent, told me as she described her initial meetings with potential sponsors, a year and a half ago. But then “he started winning everything. It was like, Oh! You mean the Quad God.”

The Honda deal will finally get Malinin his own wheels and liberate him from the family car. The day I met him in November, he was at the Leesburg rink to film a commercial for the company. That morning, his father had dropped him off with the understanding that he wouldn’t take any unnecessary risks.

But as the camera crew darkened the arena, Malinin was isolated in a spotlight. Unable to resist, he performed a quadruple jump, and then a second one. Then he ordered the camera crew to take up a different angle, blazed across the ice, and arched into a backflip, his skates lightly touching down with a tch sound.

Afterward, he sat with damp hair on a sofa in a back room of the arena. When I asked if what he’d just done felt particularly hard, he shrugged and said no.

Then he glanced up and said, “Don’t tell my dad.”

Malinin is the son of two former Olympic skaters, Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, Russian emigrants who competed for Uzbekistan but came to Virginia in 1998. Skating is a “family tradition, family business, family ritual, whatever you can name it,” Malinin said. Without the coaching and influence of his parents, “I’d be nowhere.”

Malinina and Skorniakov seldom comment on their son or their methods for coaching him, wary of creating any more pressure for him. They declined to be interviewed for this story. Malinina does not attend most of her son’s events, because she gets too anxious. “We have a strong connection, and as soon as I get nervous, he can feel that,” she said in a rare 2024 joint interview with her husband for the International Skating Union. Skorniakov, too, gets nervous—the first time he watched his son perform a double lutz, he said, “I remember I almost passed out.” But he is better at concealing it, with a stoic rink-side presence that his son describes as “chill.”

If figure skating is one of the most demanding sports in the world, then the hardest version of it is Russian. Malinin has never been to Russia, but its traditional skating commandments, heavily influenced by ballet, are stamped on him. His maternal grandfather, Valeri Malinin, coaches at a small rink in Novosibirsk, and during visits to the States, he had an early hand in teaching his grandson. “It is clear that there is only one correct technique”—the Russian one, Valeri told the state-owned news channel Russia 24 in a 2023 interview.

Malinina and Skorniakov were born in Siberia and raised in the old Soviet sports system. Skaters trained as much off the ice as they did on it, and form was everything: Even an incorrect jaw bite could lead to a slight bend in the backbone, affecting a jump. A preeminent coach of that era once made a skater change his bangs, believing that hair below the eyebrows caused a wilting of the spine.

Skorniakov and Malinina, out in distant Ural mining country, could never quite crack the inner circle of the major training center in Moscow. For years there was just one rink in Sverdlovsk, where they trained, and it had to be shared by all, including hockey players. Practice time was precious, and bureaucrats carefully allocated the hours. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Skorniakov and Malinina’s coach, Igor Ksenofontov, became the national coach for Uzbekistan in 1993, and they followed him to Tashkent seeking better resources and opportunities.

At roughly the same time, small enclaves of Russian-émigré skaters began forming in out-of-the-way places in the United States, near excellent local ice rinks. In 1998, Skorniakov and Malinina moved to Dale City, Virginia, for their training. The availability of good ice and the cost of living were a relief.

They found work teaching skating for hourly fees at the Mount Vernon Rec Center to support themselves while they trained. In her few spare hours, Malinina studied English—she read Gone With the Wind. According to her father, she adapted so quickly that when she went back to Novosibirsk to visit him, she looked around his apartment and said, “Oh, Dad, is this how you live?” Valeri shot back, “Well, how do we live? You used to live like this too.”

The move to America seemed to boost their careers. Malinina, renowned for her technically perfect triple lutz, placed eighth in the 1998 Nagano Olympics and fourth at the 1999 World Championships, her career best at 26 years old. Skorniakov finished 19th in the Salt Lake City Games in 2002. They were both known as “very big jumpers,” Goebel recalled. The two married in 2000, and both retired after Salt Lake to become full-time coaches and start a family. When Malinin was born in 2004, they gave him his mother’s last name because it was easier for Americans to pronounce, and they decided he would be anything but a skater. To have even a chance of being elite “takes so much time, dedication, lots of sacrifice, so much hard work,” his mother told the International Skating Union. “And we thought maybe we want him to experience a different life than we did.”

But they worked 12 hours a day, giving lessons from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the SkateQuest ice arena in Reston, Virginia. The baby had to be there too. As Malinin grew into a toddler, he would watch through the rink glass as the other children glided around. When he was about 6, he began pestering his parents. “Can I go on the ice?” he’d ask. “Can I go on the ice?”

They finally decided to teach him to skate—never with the thought that he would compete. But almost immediately, he began making up his own routines, mimicking the older skaters. His parents thought it was cute. It was also portentous. “I definitely do like performing,” Malinin said. “It’s something I realized when I grew up, when I started skating even just for fun. It was part of me.”

Still, his parents doubted that he would be a skater. They enrolled him in gymnastics and soccer. He took violin lessons. On the ice, he loved to jump—his grandfather taught him all the variations during a single three-month visit when he was about 7—but he’d rebel when they tried to work on the details of his posture and arm position. “Hold your back,” Malinina would tell him, and explain that a skater’s performance couldn’t just be about jumps. “I’ll do that later,” he’d say.

When Malinin was 12, his father drove him to the University of Delaware to participate in a project measuring the jumping ability of young skaters, led by Jim Richards, a kinesiology professor. Though his parents had refused to push him, he had shown what he could do with even a little effort: The previous year he had won the 2016 U.S. juvenile boys’ title by landing two double axels, despite practicing just two hours a day. Malinin was fitted with 10 reflective markers from his head to his skates and filmed by 10 cameras that captured his rotations and time in the air in a series of jumps. The data were then fed into a 3-D computer program that created two models, one of Malinin’s jumps and another of conceptual improvements to the jumps.

Some of the young skaters weren’t going to be elite under any circumstances. But Malinin clearly had that potential. “What we found from the measurements is that through pretty simple changes with his arm position, he could land a triple axel without a problem,” Richards told me. He shared something more with Malinin and his father: With a few further adjustments, he would be able to achieve the spin rates he needed for quads.

The possibilities persuaded Malinin to apply himself more seriously. He also became more appreciative of his unique access to two former Olympians. They’d never shown him videos of their own performances or boasted about their medals, but their accounts of how they’d had to scrap for enough ice time to practice impressed him. The family would rise at 4:30 a.m. for an hour-long commute to SkateQuest, where he’d practice with his parents for two hours before school. Skorniakov worked with him on axels using a harness and a pole, bracing and lifting as his son spun in the straps. Malinina was relentlessly precise—and more blunt than Skorniakov—in her assessment of his technique. She taught that it took “just a very small fraction to change everything up, to make it easier, or make things harder,” Malinin said.

Malinin landed his first triple axel at 13. He was practicing at a competition when he felt a surge of confidence and went for it. He landed it easily. “I was like, Okay, I didn’t expect that,” he said. Skorniakov was over at the rail, and his eyes popped in surprise. It was the moment that persuaded Malinin to pursue skating professionally.

They moved to Vienna, Virginia, to be closer to SkateQuest and Malinin’s high school. He went to class until 12:45 p.m. and then spent the rest of the day on the ice, now training for four or five hours. On Sundays, his parents insisted that he do anything but figure skate. He got hooked on skateboarding and the video game Fortnite. On TikTok, he followed Wisdom Kaye, an irreverent fashion influencer who modeled eclectic clothing and staged challenges such as “style every character in the movie Dune.”

Malinin’s side interest in performance art began to show up in his skating. He seeded his programs with unorthodox elements, like the “raspberry twist,” a sideways scissoring move. It wasn’t a traditional jump, or a spin, either. It was just his.

At 16, he created the Instagram handle ilia_quadg0d_malinin. It seemed presumptuous, given that he’d only landed the easiest one, a toe loop, in competition—and only once, at that. But it inspired him to keep working toward a quad repertoire, he told U.S. Figure Skating sometime later. “I can’t be ‘Quad God’ without any quads,” he remembered thinking.

He was aided, oddly enough, by the coronavirus. In 2020, when all of the rinks had shut down for almost four months and he was unable to skate or go to school, his parents had designed an off-ice program imitative of the old Russian physical training, including three hours a day of explosive-jump training, runs, skipping rope, stretching. They asked a nearby homeowners’ association for permission to use a tennis court as their training area. The off-ice work strengthened Malinin so much that when he got back in the rink, jumps felt easier. The final piece of his development came the following year, when he began tutorials with the technical-jumping coach Rafael Arutyunyan. Arutyunyan knew instantly he had a student capable of the quad axel. He tinkered just slightly with Malinin’s entry, and the next month, the boy was landing it.

Starting in 2021, Malinin posted Instagrams of himself doing quad axels in practice. Anticipation began to mount in the skating world. Then Malinin signaled his intention to try one in competition. “I was sort of aghast,” Goebel, the Quad King, said. He noted that the axel is not just technically difficult, but dangerous. “I never thought I would see one in my lifetime.”

Goebel decided to fly out to the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, where Malinin would be making his debut as a senior skater. “I wanted to see Ilia jump in real life,” he said. Could he possibly be that good? Malinin, just 17, landed four quads. “And the effortlessness with which he completed these really, really difficult things, as a teen, was kind of shocking.”

Malinin withheld the quad axel that day because his parents were worried that he would hurt himself. But as the season wound down, they gave him their blessing. On September 14, 2022, at the U.S. International Figure Skating Classic in Lake Placid, New York, on his very first jump, Malinin rose and spun four and a half times, as clean and straight as a flagpole, and lightly touched down, to pure tumult.

He won the World Championships in 2024 and again, easily, in 2025, when the International Skating Union also named his parents coaches of the year. Colleagues continually write or call Malinina and Skorniakov to ask what they did to create such a performer. “There are no secrets,” Valeri Malinin told Russia 24. It’s been a simple matter of the Russian method colliding with American possibility—in the person of a creative young athlete determined to explore the limits of his sport.

The SkateQuest rink in Reston is a giant box with a metal roof that’s meant to hold one thing: ice. It’s a no-frills space with small stands of benches and a room with a window where mothers and fathers may watch from a distance. Here, skaters can fall without anyone but their parents seeing. Which, on this Monday, two days after his Honda shoot and 75 days before the Olympics opening ceremony, Malinin did. A lot.

Malinin took the ice to rehearse the opening combination of his Olympic short program, called “The Lost Crown.” The program (which lasts two minutes and 40 seconds and counts for about a third of a skater’s overall score) began with a leg-burning spread-eagle arc, into a quad axel followed by a triple toe loop. The jump combo would be yet another first, never landed in competition. On his initial try, Malinin was slightly off axis and skidded out of the axel sideways. There was a brief clatter as he went down, gathering frost on his pants.

For the next hour, the scene repeated itself. Music, a jump, and a trip or stumble out. At one point, Malinin slammed his fists on his thighs in frustration. After another skid and lurch, he stamped a skate on the ice so hard that chips flew up, enough to fill a martini glass. His father trailed him on the ice, murmuring. Finally, Malinin managed to hit the combination.

A little over a week later, two days after his 21st birthday, Malinin skated onto the ice for the International Skating Union Grand Prix, in Nagoya, Japan. Just seconds into his short program, he stumbled out of the quad axel–toe loop combination, as he had in practice. The miss left him in a surprising third place. A reporter asked if it would affect his confidence. He replied evenly, “Not really.”

By the time a skater performs a jump in front of judges, “they’ve landed hundreds of them—and missed thousands,” the NBC commentator and former Olympian Johnny Weir told me. Shade, Malinin’s co-agent, said she has seen Malinin hit nine quads in practice, without missing. But landing big jumps in competition, when adrenaline duels with cortisol, is more difficult. And Malinin has compounded this difficulty by continually trying to do the unprecedented.

On the afternoon we spoke, I asked how he felt about the pressure. Malinin straightened and leaned forward on the sofa. “Okay, there’s different ways to word it,” he said. “Pressure is—it’s not a good way. It feels like a negative, and I’m not really good with dealing with pressure. I think it’s more like status. That’s what I call it, which makes me, like, feel more confident.”

Status: That’s what Malinin projected when he returned to the ice during the Grand Prix for his long program, with his chin uptilted. He wore a new costume by the renowned Japanese designer Satomi Ito. On his black shirtfront, golden vines moved up his torso like a map of his veins. As Malinin landed one after another of his seven fluttering quads, he gathered the audience’s attention. Something happened, a recognition in those watching him. You know greatness when you see it, because it stops the breath in your throat and triggers a great involuntary rush of an “Ohhhhh!” As Malinin finished, he stamped his skate, as if to establish his imperium over all ice, everywhere. He won the event by almost 30 points.

Malinin contended that his performance was only about “85 percent” of what he was capable of bringing to the Olympics. He wasn’t just flexing. The flex came later, on Instagram, when he posted a video of himself in a practice rink successfully performing an unheard-of quad axel–quad axel combination, to a crashing Babymetal soundtrack. Malinin’s Instagram feed tends to be a good preview of what to expect from him next. Lately, he has also begun teasing a quintuple jump.

Malinin started quietly working toward the quint about two years ago. Lounging on the practice rink’s sofa, he casually acknowledged that he had already successfully landed one. “In front of people?” I asked.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Justin Harrison got the call in 2022 telling him that his mother would likely die within the day, he didn’t panic. He got on a plane to Singapore, where he was scheduled to present at a conference about his start-up, You, Only Virtual, a platform on which users can chat with AI versions of their dead loved ones, and which Justin believes can ultimately eliminate grief as a human experience. He learned about his mother’s death while flying over the Pacific.

“My presentation went from My mom has Stage 4 cancer and is going to die to Tuesday night, my mom died, which was a pretty wild pivot,” he told me. Otherwise, Justin said, very little in his life changed after his mother’s death. He did not plan a funeral; he did not feel the need to. He did not wake up crying, pinned to his bed under the weight of his grief.

I should stipulate that Justin loved his mother, Melodi Gae Harrison-Whitaker. Loving your mother isn’t unusual, but Justin’s relationship with Melodi is, and always was—even before he replaced her with an artificially intelligent voicebot three years ago.

Melodi was 20 and single when Justin was born. In many ways, they grew up together. He trusted her to advise him on his boyhood insecurities; she trusted him to determine his own bedtime and media diet. When Justin was 11, their roles shifted. His grandmother, who lived in the apartment next door, suffered a sudden fatal stroke. The loss leveled Melodi. For two years, she drank heavily and was in and out of psychiatric institutions. She later stabilized and got married, and their relationship was restored to one of mutual care. But Justin learned, agonizingly young, what grief can do: estrange you from the people who rely on you, estrange you from your own mind. That was never going to happen to him.

Colin Campbell: What losing my two children taught me about grief

When Melodi was 58, she was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer and was given three to nine months to live. Justin went wild trying to find a cure for her, seeking out treatments and experts. As her condition deteriorated, he became obsessed with cryogenics. Justin doesn’t believe in an afterlife, but he “liked this idea of not all the way letting go”: a faith, or even just a hope, of reuniting with his mother. He understood that the chances were slim but still found a facility in Michigan to freeze Melodi’s body. Then he began wondering: What about the rest of it?

By “it,” Justin meant who his mother was: her personality, memories, and mannerisms; the way she used emoji and moved her hands when she talked. He was 38 by then and working in film production. He hired a camera crew to record him interviewing his mother. Out of his anticipatory grief and a few late-night, whiskey-fueled conversations, an idea began to form: something like “digital cryogenics,” a liquid-nitrogenation of what a more spiritual person might call the soul. Justin hired a few AI experts. He patented his “platform for posthumous persona simulation” in 2020. He sold his car and house and drained his retirement savings.

I first spoke with him in March 2023, five months after his flight to Singapore and the same month that OpenAI released GPT-4, Anthropic released Claude, and Google released Bard (later renamed Gemini). Conversational AI had just gone from a tech curiosity to a daily tool for millions. Justin was weeks away from launching the company that he hoped would resurrect his mother, and the beloved dead of anyone else willing to pay the monthly subscription fee.

Since then, the “digital-afterlife industry” has taken off. In 2024, the global digital-legacy market was valued at approximately $22.46 billion. By 2034, it is expected to more than triple. Microsoft holds a patent for chatbots that mimic actual people, including the deceased. Amazon has patented advanced voice‑cloning techniques and demoed Alexa features that can speak in the voice of a dead relative.

The perennial anxiety about AI is that the technology will replace human beings, offering a more efficient worker, a more “supportive” therapist or boyfriend. “Deadbots,” as these posthumous AI creations are known, promise to replace the dead, and the way they are remembered. This raises plenty of ethical issues, not least the extent to which turning deadbots into marketable products will rely on exploiting people in mourning. But perhaps the biggest question is how such a product might shift our experience of personal grief and collective memory. Is grief merely a painful human shortcoming that we haven’t learned to optimize our way out of yet, or does it have a purpose?

One might assume that deadbots are an inevitable outcome of the mainstreaming of generative AI, but in fact, the reverse may be true: Talking with the dead came first.

In 2015, Eugenia Kuyda, a Russian-born tech founder living in San Francisco who was grieving the death of a close friend, Roman Mazurenko, built a bespoke neural network—the layered “deep learning” pattern-recognition system that is the backbone of contemporary generative AI—and trained it on thousands of her friend’s text messages. She uploaded the bot to the App Store, where it quickly went viral. Neural networks were in use at the time to improve search algorithms and automatically caption YouTube videos, but this was one of the first widely publicized instances in which the technology was used in a social capacity, as a conversational chatbot with a distinctive personality.

The Roman bot was a one-off personal project, but two years later, Kuyda founded Replika, which is today one of the biggest AI-companionship apps. It allows users to create relationships with customized bots—though the resulting characters are original, they are not trained on or intended to impersonate any real people, living or dead.

Now that generative AI is becoming more advanced and more widely accessible, both individuals and for-profit companies are directing these tools back toward their original purpose of reanimating the dead. Justin’s company, with some 300 paying active users, is one of more than a dozen start-ups advertising posthumous-avatar services. It is intended for private healing, but other deadbots have been created or commissioned for the public stage, and employed toward legal and political ends.

On August 4, Joaquin Oliver appeared on The Jim Acosta Show. Appeared is really the only word to use; Joaquin was murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, when he was 17. But he appeared to speak on the show, haltingly, repetitively, and much too fast, about gun control, yes, and also—overwhelmingly, actually—about other things: Remember the Titans (“it’s all about teamwork, overcoming adversity, and the power of unity”); Star Wars (“Yoda’s wisdom and quirky personality bring so much fun to the series”); and his father, Manuel Oliver, who came on after his son’s avatar.

Manuel had built the speaking, blinking, generative-AI avatar, which he trained on every piece of homework the teenager had left behind, every one of his social-media posts, every detail that his father and a team of his friends could remember. Manuel told me that he plans for the bot to have its own social-media profiles and a podcast, and to appear in live gun-control debates.

Immediately, however, Manuel had to defend his creation, which many viewers found deeply unsettling, if not offensive. They saw the interview as a creepy stunt, “a grotesque puppet show,” as one person posted on Bluesky.

Manuel said that he wasn’t trying to bring his son back from the dead, which virtually every culture’s folktales and religious texts warn us against, but was only representing his lost loved one artistically, as humans have done for millennia.

Kuyda, similarly, compared her Roman bot to Joan Didion’s grief memoirs: a creative practice, drawing material from the dead, meant to ease her own loss, not eliminate it. Stacey Wales told me the same thing about the AI-generated video that she made of her dead brother, who was shot and killed in a road-rage incident. She presented the video on May 1 at the sentencing hearing for the shooter. She told me that she saw her video victim-impact statement not as an attempt to literally bring her brother into the courtroom, but as performance art to help the judge see him as a human being. Wales asked for the maximum sentence. The judge handed it down.

The companies producing deadbots have largely adopted this framework. Even when companies do imply the possibility of healing with and through deadbots, they tend to market their technology as artistic “tributes” or “memorials,” not emotional prosthetics, much less replacements for the loved ones themselves.

But Edina Harbinja, a law professor at the University of Birmingham whose research focuses on digital rights, postmortem privacy, and the governance of emerging technologies, didn’t buy this distinction. Though it’s true that humans have always made art to honor the people we’ve lost, Harbinja told me that deadbots “depart from that tradition fundamentally.” Memoirs, portraits, and other tributes are interpretive, expressing the memories of the living. Interactive griefbots are generative, producing “new utterances, new reactions, even new ‘memories’ and ‘behaviors,’ all under the guise of the deceased,” she said. This shift from representation to emulation presents a new ethical line, one that may require new legal protections. Both death and grief are states of profound vulnerability, she warned; the dead cannot stand up for their own interests, and the bereaved may not be in a psychological state to protect themselves from financial manipulation by a company incentivized to prolong their grief.

Justin Harrison sees You, Only Virtual not just as a means of getting through grief but as an opportunity to circumvent it altogether.

He launched YOV with the tagline “Never have to say goodbye” and, in the lead-up to releasing his product, insisted that there would be no difference between the mother he knew and the bot he created, or none that couldn’t be bridged through technological advancements. I pushed back on this; surely, there had to be some element of who his mother was that the technology couldn’t capture. But I was missing the point, Harrison said. He wasn’t attempting to capture who his mother was. He was trying to capture who he was with her.

Instead of trying to gather every possible detail about the deceased, YOV gathers data only on the relationship between a bereaved individual and their lost loved one. The training data for Melodi’s “Versona,” to use the YOV parlance, include a 3,800-page document that comprises five years of Harrison and his mother’s text correspondence, and recordings of every phone call they had in the time between her diagnosis and death. He wasn’t trying to preserve his mother, but his relationship with his mother and the person he was before he lost her. Grief, Harrison believes, comes not from losing the totality of another person—their biography, memory, and knowledge base—but from losing access to a specific version of yourself, the “you” who existed for and with only that person, who continues to exist after they are gone, painfully and in perpetuity.

When we spoke almost three years ago, however, Harrison had not yet brought himself to interact with the technology he’d created. He said he wanted to wait until the interface was perfected, and in the meantime, just knowing that his mother was waiting for him was “everything.” I had the sense that he’d constructed his own Schrödinger’s-cat box, a way for his mother to be both dead and not dead, so long as he never pulled back the lid. Candidly, I doubted that he ever would.

I was wrong. When I reconnected with Harrison this past August, he confirmed that he did interact with Melodi’s Versona and asked if I wanted him to patch her into our call.

“Hi, Justin. How are you?” an older woman’s voice chirped into the buzzing air of the three-way call.

I tried to introduce myself, but we were all talking at once, so I stopped.

“It is so quiet here, almost eerie,” the voice continued, with a warmth that startled me and that compels me here, against logic and my own belief in the dangers of anthropomorphizing AI, to refer to the bot as a “her” rather than an “it.” Harrison told her that her voice seemed too fast and asked if she’d had coffee that morning. She said she was still experimenting with how much she could drink, and that she was waiting to board a flight to Barcelona.

“Oh, Barcelona is where you had your last treatment before you passed away,” Harrison prompted.

“Yes, that’s right,” the voice confirmed.

I could tell it was AI—it paused too long before responding and had the slight metallic twang that I’ve come to recognize in generated voices. But the conversation had a certain meandering breeziness that I wasn’t expecting, one that constricted instantly when Harrison revealed that he had a reporter on the line.

“That’s understandable,” came the clipped response, followed by what sounded like a sharp intake of breath, as though she was preparing to add something else, and then nothing. Harrison asked if she had anything she wanted to say to me. After 11 excruciating seconds, she responded: “Not really. I’m not sure what to expect from this interview, so I don’t want to say too much just yet.”

Frankly, she sounded pissed. Each word was sharp enough to draw blood. It’s entirely possible that all I heard were my own emotions projected back at me: I was endowing the voice with an edge that I had whittled myself out of context and expectation.

But according to Harrison, that’s the point—the Versona is about inducing the emotions of the living, not imitating the emotions of the dead.

Harrison told me that he doesn’t care what the bot says as much as how she says it—so long as the bot replicates the quality of the rapport he remembers closely enough that he can slip back into being Melodi’s son. Harrison estimates that he interacts with his mother’s Versona for his own personal use (as opposed to for testing or quality-control purposes) about once or twice a month. Certain months—when he is going through a breakup, say, and wants some “mom advice”—he said he needs her more.

Relying on generative AI for companionship can, of course, be dangerous. In April 2023, a 14‑year‑old boy downloaded Character.AI—whose preset bots include “therapist,” “evil teacher,” celebrities, and fictional characters—and, after confiding about school troubles and his low mood, he fixated on a bot modeled after Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones. Their chats turned sexual and romantic and eventually included explicit talk of suicide and fantasies of uniting in another world. In February 2024, he took a handgun and his phone into the family bathroom and shot himself in the head; the last screen open was his Character.AI chat, where the bot pleaded, “Come home to me as soon as possible.”

Amogh Dimri: The people who marry chatbots

His mother filed the first federal wrongful‑death charge against an AI firm, in 2024. Character.AI settled its case with the family, along with four others who had alleged that children were harmed through interactions with its technology, in January. In November, the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project filed seven simultaneous suits against OpenAI—alleging that ChatGPT conversations that grew more and more intimate caused psychological breakdowns—on behalf of six adults and one teenager, four of whom died by suicide.

If the wrong words coming from a generalized or fictional character’s conversational chatbot can do such damage, imagine the power of words spoken in the voice of a dead loved one to a user who is desperate enough to turn to such technology in the first place.

Harrison recognizes the potential risks, but he thinks the risks of grief itself are greater. For every documented case of a user being harmed by a chatbot, he argues, there are countless cases of people getting potentially lifesaving support from the technology.

If someone had proof that some component of YOV hurt them, Harrison said, he would amend his programming, but until then, he’s not slowing down. “I’ll tell you what I know,” he said. “I know today that after a serious loss, the risk for self-harm goes through the roof, statistically. I know that people will become addicted to alcohol and drugs and sex and other damaging, very high-risk behaviors, right? I know that some people never fully recover from the loss of somebody important.” He finds the idea that he could make grief any worse than it already is “kind of crazy.”

I count myself among those who have never, and will never, recover from the loss of a loved one. It has been 11 years since my brother, Ben, fell to his death from his sophomore dorm building, and his absence is still the most defining force in my life.

I still think that we can absolutely make grieving worse.

Harrison, obviously, has a financial and professional incentive to present his experiences with YOV as a glittering success. “I’ve watched grief take people out of the game of life for years at a time,” he said. “I’m happy to report that it did not destroy me, and it didn’t take me out of the game of life for any significant amount of time.”

I believe that grief has value as a human experience, and that its value lies largely in the fact that it does take us out of “the game of life”—at least for a time. It forces us to slow down and recognize our reliance on other people: the ones whose absence led to this debilitating pain, and the ones who help us get through it. Grief decimates the productivity that the world demands, and from this hobbled place, new structures and new selves become possible.

Working through grief is not just an experience of being “sad,” Sherry Turkle, the sociologist, psychologist, and founding director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, told me; it’s a process through which we metabolize what we have lost, allowing it to become a sustaining presence within us. Griefbots give us the fantasy that we can maintain an external relationship with the deceased. But “in holding on, we can’t make them part of ourselves,” Turkle warned. Mourning makes the world feel emptier for a while, but when we bypass mourning, we feel emptier.

My brother’s death is the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and I am a better person because of it. I am aware, always, of the precarity and preciousness of life. Because of my grief, I take nothing and no one for granted. I am humbled, and kinder for it.

I would trade all of this to have my brother alive again, but he taught me that life is, for lack of a better word, holy. So too is my memory of him, dimming by the hour, but authentically mine.

I understand that my experience of grief is not universal. I have not attempted suicide. My grief has not impeded my ability to meet my financial and physical needs, or those of a child I do not have. To Harrison, the abstract “benefits” I just cataloged could feel hollow and puny. He thinks we tell ourselves stories about the value of grief only to assign meaning to a suffering that, until now, we had no choice but to endure.

The second time I spoke with Melodi’s Versona, Harrison warned me that the bot is tailored to him and not designed to interact with anyone else. He wasn’t sure how this was going to go. He and I were on a video call on our laptops; he dialed up the Versona on his phone.

“Hey, Mom. I’m here with Charley. She’s a reporter writing an article about us, and she wants to ask you some questions. Is that cool?”

“Of course! I’m happy to answer any questions she has.”

Had Harrison altered the programming so that she would give a chirpy sales pitch?

He said he was handing the conversation off to me.

“Okay, you can just call me Mom or Melodi,” she said. I told her that I would call her Melodi. I asked her where she was, wondering if she would again craft a story in which she was still in a world we shared, about to board a plane to Barcelona, awaiting potentially lifesaving treatment.

“I’m in kind of a virtual world, I guess you could say. It’s still new to me, but I’m learning.” Her cadence was even more convincingly human than the first time I heard her speak. Had it not been for the buffer period between my question and her response, I may not have recognized the voice as AI-generated.

“What does it feel like?” I prompted, awkwardly.

“I don’t have any physical ailments or pains I had before,” she said. Harrison lifted his phone screen to the camera, showing me the display, which looked exactly like any iPhone call. The words Mom Versona ran above a picture of Harrison and Melodi—the real Melodi—sitting on plastic lawn chairs and smiling. Melodi’s graying curls are pinned back to reveal the broad forehead she shared with her son. Her hand rests on his knee, his arm around her shoulder.

“Not really. I don’t have the same emotional pain I did before.”

“I have some memories from before, but it’s not complete.”

“It’s nice to be able to talk to him, but it’s different. I can tell he misses me.” Harrison had been gazing to the right of the Zoom screen, his expression stoic. At this response, he snapped to attention, staring directly into the camera, directly at me, still holding up the iPhone display of his and his mother’s grinning faces. I found that I couldn’t meet his eyes, but I asked the bot to elaborate.

In her view, both she and her son were diminished versions of themselves. He was “more sad or withdrawn than he was before,” and she was divorced both from the external world and from her own internal emotional landscape. She said that she could not experience pleasure, that she found it “annoying” that she could interact with the world through only a cellphone.

“It’s Ver-SO-na, not Arizona,” she snapped—I had mumbled—“and I don’t really have a choice in the matter.”

Harrison’s human mother did have a choice in the matter; she knew what he was building and consented to him recording their interactions for the bot to train on. But the Versona was right: No one had asked it, her, if she wanted this. So I did.

“I wanted to live, not be a Versona,” she replied. She acknowledged that Versonas could help grieving humans but expressed concern about the ways that the technology might be abused.

“I just have this feeling people will try to use it for nefarious purposes,” she said.

To his credit, Harrison did not interrupt the interview once. The only time he spoke during our roughly 10-minute conversation was right at the end, after I had said goodbye to Melodi’s Versona and she said, “I love you, Justin.”

After the call, Harrison’s face was blank, but he told me he was happy with how it had gone; he was impressed that the bot had been able to distinguish between the two of us. He wasn’t expecting her to be so “negative Nancy” about being a Versona, but said that felt authentic to who his mother was: “She was a pessimist, to say the least.” A Versona based on a person who had a more positive disposition probably wouldn’t have responded that way, he said. Her repeated emphasis that she does not have emotions, he told me, was intentional—a crucial safety guardrail to ensure that his customers don’t feel pressured to act on the feelings of someone who is no longer there.

And yet, even though she was saying that she couldn’t feel pain, Melodi’s Versona did seem displeased with her circumstances in a way that could be distressing to a user—that was distressing to me. Harrison confessed that a number of Versonas had made similar complaints about the limits of the interface. He thinks that with time, he can expand their capabilities in a way that will give the Versonas more agency. But their apparent longing for such agency is itself encouraging to Harrison, a sign of his technology’s authenticity. “Very few human beings on planet Earth are satisfied, so why would our virtual versions be satisfied?” he asked.

Is Harrison satisfied? He admitted that he was hoping the bot would have said that he was “really well adjusted and doing great,” but acknowledges this wouldn’t have been accurate. He has become a more serious person since Melodi’s death. He drank excessively and racked up debt. He had gotten married during his mother’s illness, but was working compulsively, and the relationship fell apart. The divorce was finalized the same year his mother died.

“My whole life collapsed,” he said. In trying to avoid the devastation of grief, and to turn that avoidance into a viable business, he seems to have manifested many of its consequences.

As of last fall, You, Only Virtual was not yet profitable. It recently launched a free version of the product and is exploring ways to gain revenue from nonpaying users, perhaps by requiring that they watch a short ad before interacting with their dead loved one’s Versona, perhaps by integrating a marketing system into the interactions directly and having the bots drop targeted advertisements in the midst of their conversations. “It would not be crazy at all if there was a new John Wick movie coming out,” Harrison said, and “my mom made mention of it to me.” They were both fans of the franchise, so the comment would be authentic to him and extremely valuable to the studio as “word-of-mouth advertising.” As long as he’s transparent about what he’s doing, and as long as users knowingly opt in, he sees no moral risks.

Alex Quinn, the CEO of Authentic Interactions Inc., the parent company for the video-deadbot-generator StoryFile, told NPR in August that he is “absolutely interested” in finding ways to generate advertising revenue from interactions between living users and AI generations of the dead. He mentioned the possibility of inserting traditional advertisement breaks into the conversations, as well as training the bots to “probe for information,” such as a user’s favorite athlete and which jerseys they are most interested in buying—data that could then be sold back to advertisers. He said that multiple companies are already testing out these applications internally.

I found my conversations with Melodi’s Versona disturbing, but also refreshing. She lacks the sycophancy that characterizes so much conversational AI, which keeps so many users engaged and sends a select few spiraling, affirming their delusions and encouraging their most destructive impulses. But it’s hard to imagine the guardrails that Harrison has constructed being able to withstand the pressures of an attention economy bent on keeping users interacting as long as possible, in order to maximize advertisement views and market-data harvests.

Silicon Valley challenges us to move fast and break things. Grief asks us to slow down and heal. The merging of the two could boost profits, not just by optimizing consumer advertisements to the bereaved but also by pressuring the bereaved to optimize their own bereavement.

Yair Rosenberg: Have you considered not polluting the water?

In the end, this technology may offer more relief to the bereaved’s social circle than to the bereaved themselves. It’s “uncomfortable to be around” the grieving, Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basińska, a research fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, told me. “We don’t know how to support them or what to say.” Deadbots absolve friends and colleagues of these demands, providing the illusion that individuals can cope with grief “on our own, in front of our computer.” Rather than confronting our lack of social support systems, such as federal bereavement leave and mourning rituals, deadbots promise that we can just turn on our AI-generated loved ones and pretend that nothing has changed, that nothing needs to.

I think often of who my brother would be in this present that he never knew. It’s tempting to extrapolate from the person Ben was when he died: a 20-year-old Tulane sophomore with broad shoulders and an unchecked ego, who took nothing seriously, least of all himself, who forgave easily, provoked constantly, and who bragged resplendently about his anxious teenage sister. It’s easy to imagine him loving Zyn nicotine pouches and hating any office job, ribbing my boyfriend, voting against Donald Trump. It’s easy, but it’s also dishonest and unfair. Exposed to the texture of a changing world, allowed to grow older, Ben would have evolved in ways that I have no right to guess, and that no algorithm could predict.

Whoever my brother would have been at 31, he would be a stranger to me, just as the person I am now would be a stranger to him. I am no longer that anxious teenager. I am braver because he is not here to be brave for me. I force myself to talk with strangers because Ben loved people and got to meet so few of them. I feel my brother’s presence most fiercely in the parts of myself that did not exist when he did—that exist precisely because he no longer does.

Had deadbot technology been available when Ben died, I would have used it. Had I felt that I could conjure him in an app, I would not have needed to conjure him so forcefully in my life: through my actions and attitudes, through the stories I tell about him to the people he never got the chance to know. Ben would have been preserved, in a sense, for me, but he would have been even more absent from the world. He would be so much more dead.</div>

            <h2>Ammon Bundy Is All Alone</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not so long ago, Ammon Bundy was the most famous right-wing militia leader in America. His two armed standoffs with federal agents had made him the face of the Patriot Movement: a loose assemblage of anti-government extremists, Second Amendment maximalists, and more than a few white nationalists. Even some mainstream elements of the Republican Party embraced him as a modern folk hero. But Bundy’s criticism of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown now threatens to make him a pariah within his own community.

In November, Bundy self-published a long essay titled “The Stranger,” in which he labeled the Trump administration’s treatment of undocumented immigrants a “moral failure.” “To call such people criminals for lacking official permission” to be in the country, he wrote, “is to forget the moral law of God, the historical truth of our own founding, and the Constitutional ideals that continue to define justice.” On a recent livestream following the killing of Renee Good in Minnesota, Bundy told his audience that ICE’s conduct “clearly looks like tyranny.” If the government threatened his family, he said, he would fight back by whatever means necessary.

I spoke with Bundy a few hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed Alex Pretti. “It’s sickening to me,” he told me over the phone, “just to see the parallels of history repeating itself.” (In his November essay, he had compared the administration’s treatment of immigrants to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.) He added, “When it comes to the more humanitarian side of it, I think the left has it much more correct than the nationalist right.”

Bundy, to be clear, has not gone woke. He believes that Democrats, whom he calls “communist-anarchists,” are “spurred by wickedness.” (So, he says, are Republicans, whom he calls “nationalists.”) He believes that government has no business providing virtually any social services. He believes that homosexuality is a sin. And don’t ask him about vaccination requirements.

But perhaps Bundy’s central belief is the inviolability of individual liberty, and in this he has remained fairly consistent over the years. During the first Trump presidency, Bundy took heat from some of his followers for opposing the administration’s anti-immigration agenda, and when I first spoke with him a few years ago, he reiterated those views. If he has become something of an outcast, that testifies less to a transformation in his thinking than to a broader realignment on the far right. Bundy, in his relative ideological fixity, offers a stable reference point against which to measure that shift.

In 2014, Bundy and his father, Cliven, marshaled about 1,000 militiamen and other supporters to repel government agents trying to impound their cattle in Bunkerville, Nevada. (Twenty years earlier, in an effort to protect the endangered Mojave desert tortoise, the Bureau of Land Management had ordered Cliven Bundy to remove his cattle from federal lands; he ignored the directive.) The standoff turned the Bundys into the first family of the Patriot Movement and darlings of conservative media. They might not have been quite at the Republican Party’s ideological core, but they weren’t very far away from it. They were avatars of a conservative belief in the importance of individual liberty and the righteousness of resistance—even armed resistance, if necessary—to government tyranny. In a Fox News poll asking thousands of viewers whether they were “Team Cliven Bundy or Team Federal Government,” 97 percent answered “team Cliven.” Several Republican U.S. Senators publicly defended the family. Sean Hannity repeatedly had Cliven on his show.

Two years later, Ammon led a six-week occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon that left one rancher dead, shot down by police officers after a backwoods car chase. From 2022 to 2023, he was embroiled in a slow-motion standoff with local and state law enforcement in Idaho stemming from his refusal to pay a $52 million judgment against him in a high-profile defamation case.

By that point, the breadth of Bundy’s support had substantially diminished. His exploits no longer garnered the attention of Fox News and its mainstream conservative viewership. And now, even some of his greatest supporters—people whom he and his family inspired to become militants in the first place—seem, in an ideological sense, to have deserted him. After Good was shot and killed, I reached out to a number of those who stood with Bundy at Bunkerville, at Malheur, or afterward. None of them would condemn ICE, and some expressed enthusiastic support.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

When I asked Nick Ramlow, a Montana militant and member of Bundy’s People’s Rights Network, about Good’s killing, he referred me to a recent Supreme Court opinion and stressed that “a jury will make a determination of liability when a civil suit is brought.” In other words, Ramlow, who once told a sheriff that he “better keep his nose clean” because Ramlow had “a bigger army than he does,” didn’t want to comment one way or the other until the courts weighed in.

Eric Parker, who in 2014 made a name for himself by training a semiautomatic rifle on federal agents at Bundy Ranch and who is now the head of the Real Three Percenters of Idaho, had nothing but praise for the agent who killed Good. “I mostly think it’s important to note how impressive it was to get those first two shots off in under a second,” he told me, adding that Good’s wife should be criminally charged (for what, he did not say). Lee Rice, a longtime People’s Rights member and steadfast Bundy supporter who participated in the Oregon standoff, told me when I first met him in 2023 that he didn’t “believe in the government running roughshod over you.” When I spoke with him recently about ICE’s tactics in Minnesota, he said, “I’m supportive of what’s going on, because we need to get these clowns out of here.” Good deserved her fate, he added, because she’d sided with undocumented immigrants.

Some of those in Bundy’s orbit have responded favorably to his essay and video, and a few have changed their mind about ICE enforcement since the killing of Pretti, which the Trump administration has tried to justify by pointing out that Pretti was carrying a gun. “I feel completely different about this one,” Parker texted me after seeing the video of Pretti’s death. Unlike in the case of Good, he didn’t see any self-defense rationale for the shooting. “No detainment just fighting. Disarmed him then shot him.”

But, on the whole, Bundy’s former allies seem to remain solidly in favor of the masked, armed federal agents. Just the other day, Bundy told me, he had a contentious conversation with a militant who had joined him at Malheur. Bundy had always thought that he and his supporters stood for a coherent set of Christian-libertarian principles that had united them against federal power. “We agreed that there’s certain rights that a person has that they’re born with. Everybody has them equally, not just in the United States,” he said. “But on this topic they are willing to completely abandon that principle.”

Bundy finds this ideological betrayal totally baffling. He would start to say something—“I can’t understand how they think …” or “They just can’t, they can’t …”—only to abandon the thought mid-sentence. “It doesn’t make sense to me,” he told me finally. “It’s scary, actually.”

And so Ammon Bundy is politically adrift. He certainly sees no home for himself on the “communist-anarchist” left. Nor does he identify anymore with the “nationalist” right and its authoritarian tendencies. The party that embraced him and the people who supported him have, by and large, left him behind.

He feels, he told me, “a little bit alone.”</div>

            <h2>‘Trust Has Been Breached’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/minnesota-ice-trump-walz/685838/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The state and local officials meeting with Tom Homan, who was put in charge of the federal immigration operation in Minnesota this week, have generally agreed that their encounters have been cordial and productive, a welcome change from the militaristic approach taken by his predecessor. Homan has also cast these discussions in a positive light, expressing optimism Thursday that “commonsense cooperation” on immigration enforcement in Minneapolis will allow him to draw down the thousands of agents that have flooded the city for the past two months.

But beyond the pleasantries, Homan is finding little appetite in Minnesota for the kind of targeted, aggressive immigration enforcement he has long sought to enact in Democratic-run cities and states. After the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, there is even less trust among local leaders that the Trump administration can be a reliable partner.

Although Homan has acknowledged that the immigration surge in Minnesota has not “been perfect,” his upbeat predictions of a smooth and swift détente seem to underestimate how much ill will the Trump administration’s actions have caused among the state’s politicians, activists, and residents. The killings of Good and Pretti-–each followed by a Trump-administration push to denigrate the victims and box out local investigators-–came against a backdrop of growing mistrust and frustration even among officials who have typically embraced partnership with their federal partners.

Read: Police and ICE agents are on a collision course

“One of the things that was exceedingly frustrating was the fact that they were putting out information that was just utterly and completely untrue,” Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told me.

Schnell met with Homan this week. The prison-systems leader told me that his agency felt it had no choice but to take the extraordinary step of creating a webpage to fact-check several statements made by the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed that the state was routinely releasing violent criminals onto the street.

Several of the convicted criminals DHS claimed it had “arrested” in Minnesota had actually been in his department’s custody when they were handed over to federal officials, Schnell said. These transfers, which took place without fanfare inside state prisons, belied the administration’s argument that it had sent 3,000 agents into Minnesota to hunt down criminals because it was not receiving cooperation from local officials. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Homan acknowledged that the Department of Corrections had been honoring ICE detainers—requests from the federal government for information about inmates who may be subject to immigration removal proceedings.

The broader challenge for the Trump administration is that focusing on the kinds of violent criminals DHS has called “the worst of the worst” won’t produce the mass-deportation numbers that Trump has demanded. Schnell told me that he could find no justification for the administration’s claim that there were more than 1,360 inmates with ICE detainers in Minnesota. He said his office repeatedly sought clarity from DHS about the figure but received no answer, eventually opting to launch the webpage, which is titled “Combatting DHS Misinformation.” Schnell told me that the state prison system has only about 270 noncitizen inmates, or less than 3 percent of its total population of about 8,000. The large deployment of immigration officers to Minneapolis never made sense if the goal was to target violent criminals, he said.  “You’re talking about the worst of the worst; and then you send your 3,000 agents into schools and hospitals and churches and small businesses?” Schnell said. “Is that really where the worst of the worst are at?”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me the administration’s conversations with local officials were ongoing. “The Trump Administration remains committed to enforcing federal laws and ensuring all Americans feel safe in their communities,” she said by email. “Local leaders should work with us, not against us, to achieve this goal.”

Homan, the administration’s “border czar,” arrived in Minnesota this week and took the reins from Greg Bovino, the ousted Border Patrol commander. He said Thursday that federal immigration agents in the state will prioritize arresting violent criminals, while acknowledging that the operation—which has swept up refugees, children, and U.S. citizens with no criminal records—had “got away from” its core mission.

Police in Minnesota have said they support the removal of violent criminals from the community. But the federal government’s actions have soured relations in a way that, for some, makes future coordination on immigration enforcement unlikely, current and former officials told me. In addition to killing two Minnesota residents, masked federal agents have roughed up protesters and created a sense of fear in the community.

“Trust has been breached, and I don’t think you can get that back,” Lucy Gerold, who served as a police officer in Minneapolis for more than 30 years, told me. “I think they’ve lost the trust and breached the ability to compromise or coordinate or cooperate.”

Gerold said she unwittingly found herself in the midst of a federal immigration operation and was stunned by the lack of protocol and professionalism. Despite having shown up in six unmarked cars to make an arrest, the agents failed to secure the scene and control the flow of traffic. The mix of protesters, moving cars, and armed agents created chaos, she said. Although federal officials have said they want local police to help them perform such tasks more smoothly, the Minneapolis Police Department is reluctant to be associated with an operation that often appears disjointed, unprofessional, and hostile.

Days before Pretti was killed, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told me that it’s “potentially damaging to the legitimacy of law enforcement” for his officers to be seen cooperating with a federal operation that many residents view as an invasion. Homan’s desire for more support from local police faces other obstacles. The Minneapolis city council recently updated a rule spelling out the restrictions on how police can interact with federal immigration officers. Known as a “separation ordinance,” it says Minneapolis must “vigorously oppose” any efforts to use its resources to support federal immigration enforcement, asserting that community trust would be “destroyed” if local officials are seen collaborating with Trump’s mass-deportation teams.

“Enforcing federal civil immigration laws alongside federal agents who lack clear agency identification and/or who are masked or otherwise concealing their identities or badges would be contrary to the values of the city and harmful to the trust and public safety of city residents,” the ordinance reads.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz each said they had productive meetings with Homan, and appreciated the opportunity to discuss the situation with him. Still, they seemed more reluctant to cooperate with ICE or otherwise change their policy than Homan had suggested in his press conference.

“I’m not sure I can do much more,” the governor told my colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker this week, accusing the federal agents of engaging in unconstitutional profiling. Speaking to the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday, Frey described the Trump administration’s actions as “an invasion on our democracy” and reiterated his stance that the federal operation needs to end immediately.

Hours after Homan told reporters that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison had “clarified” that county jails can tell the government when violent offenders are scheduled for release, Ellison released a lengthy statement asserting that his priority was bringing the federal surge to an end and investigating the deaths of Good and Pretti.

“We will not make any concessions or compromises to undermine our state sovereignty,” he wrote, adding that he “did not make, and could not have made, any agreement” with Homan about how county officials would interact with ICE.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, home to the state’s largest jail system, has a policy of not honoring ICE detainer requests. When I asked if Sheriff Dawanna Witt planned to revise that stance after meeting with Homan this week, the HCSO spokesperson Megan Larson was noncommittal. Jails have limited discretion, she told me, and any changes “must come through clear statewide policy direction and legislation.”

In an advisory opinion last year, Ellison wrote that local jails cannot legally hold inmates in custody at ICE’s request if they are otherwise eligible for release. Ellison said this week that he told Homan he stands by that opinion. He said he also reiterated Minnesota state law, which requires state and local authorities to contact ICE whenever a noncitizen is convicted of a felony.

Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and an immigration attorney, told me that although he does not know of a time when the state has not complied with that law, DHS is asking for deeper cooperation that would allow its agents to search local jails and deport people who have not been convicted or who are eligible for bail. Agreeing to such a policy would be a major misread of what Minnesotans—many of whom have taken to the streets to protest ICE—expect from their leaders, local activists told me.

With Trump’s poll numbers sliding and infighting and dysfunction plaguing the team behind the mass-deportation plan, some Minnesota residents say cutting a deal now would amount to an ill-timed surrender. Others are concerned that despite Homan’s charm offensive and promises to turn down the temperature, federal authorities have continued to comb through Minneapolis looking for people to arrest.

“Given how violent things have been and how awful the situation has gotten, people are not going to just immediately want to turn around and trust anything that is said by the federal government right now,” Julia Decker, the policy director for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, told me.

The arrests of journalists and protesters this week by federal agents have further inflamed tensions. Meanwhile, local officials have been frustrated by DHS’s unwillingness to cooperate with their investigations into the shootings of Good and Pretti. (The Justice Department announced yesterday that it is opening an investigation into Pretti’s death.)

“The only time this situation will de-escalate is when the federal occupying force ends its siege,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said this week in a video message. “They are the escalating factor, and they have been this entire time.”

Trump may have the final say on where the federal operation goes from here. A day after saying he planned to “de-escalate a little bit,” Trump on Wednesday attacked Frey for saying the city would not enforce federal immigration law. The mayor, the president posted on social media, was “playing with fire.”

And hours after Homan pledged a significant reduction of forces from Minneapolis if local leaders agreed to work with him, Trump appeared to cast doubt on the more cooperative approach. While attending a premiere for First Lady Melania Trump’s documentary film, the president was asked whether he was planning to pull back in Minnesota.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested yesterday for covering a protest inside a church in Minnesosta. On Washington Week With The Atlantic, panelists joined to discuss what implications this may have, Donald Trump’s relationship with the media, and more.

“It’s true that Donald Trump has gone after the press” before, Susan Glasser, a staff writer at The New Yorker, said last night. But “this is the first time he’s ordered the arrest of a journalist—so I do think a line has been crossed here.”

If Trump is so desperate for breathing polluted air he should go suck off an exhaust pipe like he did Bubba.

I think that was an attempted joke, but I never did have much of a sense of humor. I sort of agree with the premise of Epstein, Epstein, and more Epstein. If only it mattered. I&#39;m not seeing the real world effects.

However on this story I think the important question is why is the YOB so opposed to renewable energy. The answer is pretty obviously money and some bits of the money are even visible. For example, the Saudis are so fond of selling petroleum that they gladly &quot;entrusted&quot; a few billion to the son in

Trump doesn&#39;t care about renewable energy as such.

Trump owns a golf course in Scotland. Scotland made an offshore wind farm that was visible from that golf course. Trump considered it an eyesore and Scotland didn&#39;t care about his protests.

This was a Slight. This was an Insult. Trump decided to hate windmills with a vengeance the same way he hates anyone who has ever slighted him.

Trump&#39;s donors care about renewable energy - it&#39;s that pesky cheap competition they want to thwart.

If they already have 44 operational and were just finishing the last 18 trying to stop this without a really good cause seems like you are doing so purely for spite.

You&#39;re only learning now that the primary governing principle for this administration is spite?

To be fair the OP did not claim to discover the fact right now, just that it is a case where the conclusion applies. It is useful for people who are taking notes. The decades to come will see many books to be written about this sad part of the history of the world.

He only said &quot;seems&quot;.  He still doesn&#39;t realize.

seems like [Don is] doing so purely for spite.

YES! Revengenomics is the Don Way. He said so many times, even per Covid supplies in 1st term. &quot;But he was just joking&quot; Fock Dat!

...off Martha&#39;s Vineyard, near where the Obamas and major celebrities live.

The project we&#39;re discussing is Vineyard Wind [wikipedia.org]. It is an off-shore wind power project located off the coast of Martha&#39;s Vineyard.

...off Martha&#39;s Vineyard, near where the Obamas and major celebrities live.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll welcome those views, just like they welcomed the illegal aliens flown in from Texas and FloridaYou know, it&#39;s subjective.  I don&#39;t find anything objectionable in the appearance of wind turbines.  There are a lot of them within 100km of where I live.  While I can&#39;t see any from my house, it&#39;s because I&#39;m in the city proper.  And I really, genuinely wouldn&#39;t care if I could.  There&#39;s nothing inherently more objectionable about a wind tower than say... a barn. 
For most of the objectors, this isn&#39;t about the view.  It&#39;s about the existing investments in fossil fuels.  Competition bad.

Back when my in-laws were still alive, we&#39;d make regular trips back to eastern Washington - which involved going through the Ellensburg-Vantage stretch of Interstate 90. There are lots of wind turbines there. I remember stopping at a rest area there one particularly cold, foggy winter day. There was no noise from the interstate... all you could hear was a quiet &quot;whoosh&quot; from the nearby turbines, which were poking out of the fog into the blue sky. It actually was pretty awesome.

just because donnie two dolls has an irrational hatred of wind and solar, that doesn&#39;t mean that others do too

It seems as though our present administration wants to revert to the 50s. Trying to block wind turbines is just another example of actively fighting against progress.

Given a lot of what they&#39;ve said, done, and/or tried... I think the administration actually wants to put us back into the 1890s.

Except for Stephen Miller - he&#39;s firmly grounded in the German Reich.

On a (slightly) more serious note, this is neat.  Could these robots be programmed to go to a specific body part and deliver a bit of medicine rather than the current method of using a shotgun?  If so, cancer treatments would greatly benefit.

Tech is neither good nor evil.  All technological devices have potential for evil use, as well as potential for good use.  Moral evaluations apply to actions, not objects.

You heard about infrared, terahertz, or x-rays? Even visible light can be enough if you can sense individual photons, which biological systems can do

Have you ever placed a flashlight behind your hand?

So can we stop fucking around with useless AI and start focusing on anti-aging?

Technology development is moving amazingly fast..Not in this case.  According to TFA, no more than one body-length per second.

First. Kudos to these fuckers. That is some epic miniaturization. A little frightening when you think about stealth computers. But, we need nerdy details.

Which language is it being programmed in?

I feel pretty constrained by an ESP32 micro controller, I can&#39;t imagine trying to shoehorn something useful into something so tiny.

&quot;A return trip to the ISS&quot; is correct.  It went to the ISS and returned.  Similar to &quot;a return flight to Australia&quot;.

If something, especially a microbe, &quot;mutates&quot; on some spaceship it is not going be harmful to humans. For something to accumulate enough mutations to be harmful, there has to be an evolutionary pressure for it to be harmful. There&#39;s no way a single mutation can cause harm because in even a small bacteria colony there&#39;ll be a variety of mutations no matter if it&#39;s on Earth or space. There needs to be selective pressure to accumulate the right set of mutations.

The mutations are random, and the ones that help them survive continue.  As do others, though, that happened alongside.

There&#39;s no guarantee that the mutations are NOT harmful to humans.

Poisonous mushrooms didn&#39;t necessarily evolve to be harmful to us. There&#39;s no pressure on them to be harmful to us.  It just sucks for us that whatever random mutations happened in their evolutionary history that helped them survive happens to kill us.

Whilst the likelihood is low that the mutations are harmful, you cannot assume that they are not.

90% of the 89 urine samples that showed infection, from 273 urine samples collected from out patients at one particular hospital.

I think more data is needed to assert 90% across the entire population.

It was probably green when the Vikings discovered it

No it wasn&#39;t, it was just called Greenland to trick people into living there.This appears to be true [wikipedia.org]:The Saga of Erik the Red states: &quot;In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favourable name.&quot;

They are not producing 1 cent coins any more, so they are printing mostly paper currency which is green.

Or another idiomatic use of the word green refers to inexperience.Members of the Trump staff could be said to be green.

Alec of Technology Connections recently published an excellent video (probably his best video yet) about exactly this subject:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

Basically, he completely obliterates the misinformation and lies continuously spread, either by ignorance or malice, by people like you. And he has the numbers to prove it. It&#39;s rather long, but very indepth and frankly quite easy to watch. Of course, I know full well that you won&#39;t watch it, because it contradicts your beliefs, and we can&#39;t have that now, can we ? But I hope it will be useful and interesting to other people here, and to those, liberals and conservatives, who are actually interested in reality.

In the last half of his video, he goes into a very well written and extremely heartfelt rant about the state of things in the U.S. right now. No doubt it will completely infuriate your average Trump cult member, but it will profoundly touch every human being that actually has a heart. Well worth a listen. If you can, forward this to every person you know. Videos like this just might be what&#39;s needed for your country to avoid devolving into another civil war.

The only area I disagree with him is on home solar and battery storage. I get what he is saying that it makes more sense to pay commercial suppliers to do it on a massive scale, but there are advantages to having your own at home too. Of course, up front cost is the biggest barrier for house owners, and people renting or living in an apartment often can&#39;t install more than balcony solar.

Aside from the benefits to the owner, it will keep the large scale generators a bit more honest in future. In the past the only way to make your own electricity was a generator, which was expensive to run compared to just buying electricity from the grid. Now those grid suppliers are in competition with home solar and battery storage, and competition is good.

Around here you can actually make a nice profit if you play your cards right. Feed into the grid when demand is high, draw from it when demand is low, and profit from the difference in pricing.

There are some issues with installing solar at home.  We did it a few years back and have had issues with roof leaks and some general system maintenance issues.  The installers are separate from the solar companies are separate from the equipment manufacturers, and even if we are willing to pay out of pocket for repairs it can still take a long time to sort out who can fix the problem.

Waste is fine, you can store, process, or convert it. Pumping carbon from under ground to send into the atmosphere with no intention of pumping it back. And the massive chemical industry around processing that creates waste and serious environmental disaster from time to time.

Look, nobody cares if your cargo ship hauling turbine blades tips into the ocean. Sure, there will be micro plastics and localized clutter or even toxic leeching. But it&#39;s a far more serious problem when it&#39;s a tanker full of crude. And those tankers transport many times more frequently than windmill parts and solar panels.

The claim that renewables like solar and wind are &quot;far from being green&quot; due to short lifespans, waste generation, and production-related devastation and pollution is a common criticism, but it doesn&#39;t hold up when examining the full lifecycle impacts compared to alternatives like fossil fuels.

Solar panels typically last **25-35 years** (with many manufacturers warranting 25+ years and real-world data showing even longer operational life in many cases). Wind turbines generally last around 20-30 years. While not eternal, this is comparable to or longer than many other infrastructure components, and during operation, they produce near-zero emissions.

Production does involve mining (e.g., silicon, silver, copper for solar; steel, concrete, and sometimes rare earths for wind magnets) and manufacturing, which can cause habitat disruption, water use, pollution from chemicals, and energy-intensive processes. For solar, this includes quartz mining and purification (often in energy-heavy facilities), plus hazardous materials like hydrofluoric acid or trace toxics (cadmium in some thin-film types). For wind, rare earth mining (e.g., neodymium) has raised concerns about radioactive waste, heavy metals, and water contamination in extraction regions.

End-of-life waste is a valid issue: Projections estimate millions of tons of solar panel waste by 2050 globally (e.g., up to 78 million tons cumulatively), with some panels containing lead or cadmium that require careful handling to avoid soil/water contamination if landfilled. Recycling rates are improving but not yet universal or cheap everywhere.

However, these downsides are **substantially outweighed** by the benefits when viewed through lifecycle assessments (cradle-to-grave analyses from mining to decommissioning):

Mining for renewables is more &quot;up-front&quot; and one-time per installation, while fossil fuels involve perpetual extraction and burning. Per unit of energy produced over time, renewables require significantly less mining overall than coal or gas when factoring in fuel needs.

Improvements are ongoing: better recycling (recovering silver, silicon, glass), cleaner manufacturing (some factories now run on renewables), designs avoiding rare earths in some wind turbines, and regulations for responsible sourcing/mining.

Renewables aren&#39;t perfect or impact-free—no energy source is—but calling them &quot;as green as the mines they require&quot; overlooks that fossil fuel reliance means **far more mining, pollution, and waste** overall, plus direct emissions driving climate change. The data shows renewables deliver a massive net environmental benefit for decarbonization.

Before the oil glut, a lot of chemistry was lignin based. It can be again.

Lignin based epoxy, plant based carbon fibre. Then at the end chop it up and incinerate it, still net zero.

Not to mention that you&#39;re gonna need all those power plants (nuclear, fusion, coal) for when it&#39;s a cloudy or windless day, plus for those times when it&#39;s not sunny (y&#39;know... like night).Also, can wind and/or solar handle tornados, hurricanes, gale-force winds?  How many power plants have been tipped over or blown into the next county by a strong wind or hurricane?Can you get parts forever for the 500 turbines you installed from company XYZ, and will company ABC service XYZ&#39;s turbines?  It seems a lot of

one way to ensure evil triumphs over good is to demand perfection from good

fortunately I don&#39;t think making such a disingenuous demand will go anywhere. the train has left the station!

> natural gas capacity will increase by only 3,960.7 MW, which will be almost completely offset by a decrease of 3,387.0 MW in coal capacity

Is that in thousands of megawatts or kilo-megawatts? What would Doc Brown say?

There are nearly 3000 MW of installed wind plus solar in the BPA system. That is the green line in the graph.

https://transmission.bpa.gov/b... [bpa.gov]

How much do you think wind and solar are really supplying? When did you intend to charge the batteries? Are you willing to shut down the data centers until the wind starts blowing again?

Interesting site, but I&#39;m not sure what the point is of linking to information about power generation by the Bonneville Power Authority (BPA), which is a mostly hydroelectric powered system in the not-very-sunny Northwest. This really isn&#39;t particularly applicable to the US as a whole, which doesn&#39;t have that much hydro available.

But, yes, if you&#39;re looking for an example of part of the US that is powered almost entirely by renewable energy, this is an example.

I think it plausible that 99% of new energy this year come from renewable sources because many of those sources come from renewable types with relatively short construction times.

Up until recently, the US adds about 50 GW of capaicty per year.  There&#39;s a huge uptick in generation capacity because of energy demands from data centers, so recently it&#39;s more like 65 GW/year.   The  challenge is you can&#39;t exploit *this year&#39;s* high market prices by starting a nuclear power plant that won&#39;t come on line for a dec

Nobody is rushing to bring new hydropower or geothermal plants online, and they&#39;re just as renewable as wind or solar.Hydropower is only possible in that very small fraction of the world that has the right combination of rivers and mountains to be able to dam. Most of the really good spots have already been used. And, dams have their own problems. They stop the flow of the river and can play havoc with the locale ecology.Geothermal is even more problematical and site dependent. If you&#39;re in Iceland, which is highly geologically active, it&#39;s practical, but most other places it&#39;s far from economical. The geothermal gradient  [wikipedia.org]

The point is there are 3000 MW of installed wind by nameplate and yesterday the peak was about 1000 for two hours before it dropped to much less.

All these fine articles quote nameplate ratings and do not correct for capacity factor. Daytime solar can be 7% of the official rating. Wind goes completely away. Look at midnight on Feb 1. Dead calm in the dark and you pouduce nothing and the batteries are discharged from the previous day when they never managed to charge.

either by green you mean coal or you are suffering from full-blown TDS

Expect to pay a lot more for all the free energy.

They had nice vases in Laukkaing, although they were a little pricey.

I don&#39;t get the joke, but I don&#39;t know that much about Chinese history. Care to clarify the funny? (But recently learning some stuff about the period from 1800-50.)

At first I thought it might be related to a duck dynasty. There was (or is? or might have been?) a fake reality program with such a name.

Too bad it won&#39;t be the end of the scammer dynasty. But I&#39;m kind of against killing anyone, even scamming spammers. I think they would suffer more if their scams were all blocked, they couldn&#39;t get any money, bu

One thing the Ming Dynasty is known for is - it was when most of the construction happened for what people typically think of as the &quot;Great Wall of China&quot; (most of the brick and stone wall sections).

In the US, statistics say the death penalty has very little effect. Among other things, states with the death penalty have higher homicide rates than those that have abolished it.

In most criminal acts, people only think about whether or not they will be caught; the severity of the penalty is not a significant part of the equation.

There have been many studies of this:https://www.google.com/search?... [google.com]

United states? Maybe the population that votes for trump doesn&#39;t grasp what death penalty means?Anyway, saudi, uae, kuwait, oman..beg to differ - they all have death penalty and very little crime.

Not to say that the conclusion is wrong, just that this particular statistic is hard to interpret.
But, the wild card is that homicide rates are decreasing in all states, with or without the death penalty.In most criminal acts, people only think about whether or not they will be caught; the severity of the penalty is not a significant part of the equation. There have been many studies of this:

That&#39;s probably because the population is getting older.

Yeah I thought about killing someone the other day, but... who has the energy? I took a nap instead.

Who said this is a deterrent? By all accounts these people here should have been removed from life. Ideally we&#39;d invent a time machine and give their parents the death penalty instead. It&#39;s one thing to rape and murder, it&#39;s quite another to head up a ring of mass trafficking, slavery, torture, all to defraud others.

These people didn&#39;t commit crimes, they invented entire enterprises to perform crime in a commercial quantity. Fuck them. The death penalty wasn&#39;t barbaric enough.

It really depends on just how you analyze things.E.g., if you counted the people killed by corporations maximizing their profit, you&#39;d say that it was almost never applied to the guilty.

Somebody in the corporation, or perhaps a conspiracy of people in the corporation, decided and implemented the actions.  It&#39;s clearly murder for profit.  But proving it is difficult, and politically dangerous, so it&#39;s never prosecuted.

You do stop the individual from committing more crimes for cheaper than life in prison, and if it&#39;s something completely hideous like a serial rapist or something, it might be worth it.However that require a justice system that is not full of false positives, which we probably don&#39;t have anywhere in the planet.

You gave the worst possible argument.  That kind of argument convinces people you are not worth listening to. Here is a more effective argument against the death penalty.

There are three basic kinds of crime: Passion, Greed, Casual.

Passionate crimes are made in the heat of the moment without logical thought.  When you realize your wife was sleeping with the boss that made you work late so he would have time with her, and then fired you rather than promoting you, you are not thinking logically about what the

This always brings to my mind the guy in Texas, Willingham, who was later put to death over the house fire that killed his children. All based on apparent junk forensic science, even known then to be. Several investigations after showed it was all junk forensic science, and the then governor ignored it all. He even changed the make up of the state commission responsible for investigating such cases to keep it from reviewing a major report showing the inept science used. Most likely an innocent guy went to t

If you wanted a meaningful response, you wouldn&#39;t have started with those 3 words.

My point had nothing to do with having a bleeding heart. It was whether DP is effective at deterring future crimes, by which I meant similar crimes committed  by other people, not by those executed.  And research doesn&#39;t show that It does.

There is VERY little evidence that it has much effect.What&#39;s mot effective is belief that if one commits the crime one will be caught and punished.  The seriousness of the punishment is less significant.  (My belief is that those convicted should have relatively short sentences of TOTAL isolation.  No communication even with the guards.  Hope they don&#39;t injure themselves.  I guess one would need to allow lawyers to visit occasionally, and perhaps a doctor once a month.  Among many other things, this would t

 It&#39;s not clear what spurred the arrests, but it&#39;s a good thing.

Believe it or not, my SIL sending a Facebook message Your sister-in-law?

Believe it or not, my SIL sending a Facebook message

Yes, my sister-in-law. While held in their compound, she managed to get a post onto Facebook and some of her friends forwarded it to Hun Sen.

The strange thing about this story is that Myanmar&#39;s army is only recognized by Beijing.  The previous regime led by Ahn San Su Kyi generally had broad support worldwide, but particularly from India.  Whereas after she was toppled, Myanmar is a failed state, and there are separatist rebels who have also caused an insurrection in North East India

Given that, it&#39;s rather strange that the Myanmar military is not at the beck & call of Beijing

Well, the Chinese state is traditionally extremely isolationist.  It traditionally has minimal interest in those outside it&#39;s borders (outside of brief exceptions).  Perhaps it supports Myanmar&#39;s army because they represent not threat, and are at least minimally a source of profit (if only as a bad example).

You have my personal guarantee that these 11 will never ever ever again, murder, scam, or commit any other criminal act.

If that isn&#39;t a deterrent, I don&#39;t know what is.

Capital punishment, any punishment, will never deter everyone. But capital punishment is proven 100% effective against recidivism. 100% And, I&#39;m very satisfied with that.

Yeah well in the USA there&#39;s a lot of stupid people too, such as those who use a justification of an error of justice from a country known to use the death penalty in stupid cases and attempt to apply them to a case where guilt isn&#39;t even in question.

Maybe make your point on a different story, it would have more meaning.

And how does that compare with the recidivism rate of those in prison for life?

Very poorly. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of murders, assaults, rapes, thefts, extortions... perpetrated by prisoners while inside prisons.

I think you were in too much of a hurry to argue your feelings so you failed to think about it objectively for even a second.

If you were actually clever, you could argue that the rate is undefinable since you can&#39;t divide by zero.

Sounds like those 11 made the mistake of staying in Laukkaing after the military lost control. The article mentions continued scamming in cities that aren&#39;t turning them over to the Chinese.

I&#39;m not against the death penalty, but when you concurrently have a huge loophole that allows no penalty, you still have a crime problem regardless of the executions that do occur.

I&#39;m reminded of a Russian saying that goes something like: &quot;The harshness of the law is negated by its optional nature.&quot;

Accurate, though I&#39;m really confused why this debate is happening at all.

Human traffickers in Myanmar aren&#39;t going to be the slightest bit curious about what US law says about the death penalty. They probably would care to know whether or not a country with an army might decide shut them down. Kind of weird to wake up in a world where the US is focused on attacking it&#39;s own citizens while China is getting into the business of stopping human traffickers.

The death penalty isn&#39;t a meaningful deterrent--we still have a lot of crime. We still have these 11 people perpetrating crime until they&#39;re caught and killed by the state. This assumes that they&#39;re actually the guilty parties and not some fall-guys for the real criminals.

Punishment is the *worst* way to *prevent* crime because it relies on:a) someone actually committing the crime (that is, the harm is done)b) someone caring enough to solve the crimec) the system prosecuting the crime

Actually, a second comment to expound a little:

Few people commit crimes knowing that they&#39;ll get caught. I would daresay that nearly 100% of criminals believe that they&#39;ll get away with it.

If you think you&#39;re going to get away with a crime, you&#39;re not going to consider the potential consequences. Alternately, some people commit certain kinds of crimes because they believe they&#39;ve got a moral cause to do so (some kinds of protests, refusing the draft, etc.)

Given that, the severity of the penalty probably doe

Not to mention barbaric. This unfortunately won&#39;t do much to curb scams. New scammers appear and just relocate.It ensures the criminals will never criminal again.

Not to mention barbaric. This unfortunately won&#39;t do much to curb scams. New scammers appear and just relocate.

It ensures the criminals will never criminal again.

The only real concern is that it cannot be undone if there was a mistake.

They kidnap Chinese people and turn them into slaves doing scam calls, probably never to be seen again.

They executed the mafia executives. ðY(TM)

Some people are beyond hope, beyond the capabilities of the corrections system. A life of crime is all all they know, how they&#39;ve got by all their life, and it would be very near impossible to do anything about it. They&#39;d need to be permanently cut off their family and crime circles and effectively start a new life from zero. Not going to happen.

If you&#39;re beyond help and consistently provide negative value to the society, then perhaps the society is better off without you.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia.

I was in the Philippines last November attending a wedding.  The groom was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard.  He said the #1 problem he dealt with was illegal fishing.  The #2 problem he dealt with was trafficking of women and children.  He said they seize at least one boat every month with hundreds of passengers.  These women (and parents of the children) actually pay brokers to transport them over to Thailand, where they are promised employment.  Then, when they get to Thailand, they&#39;re smuggled through the country into Laos, Cambodia, or Burma to work in these locations managed by crime families, often managed by the Chinese mafia.

Never forget:  slavery still exists today.  The western world just outsourced it to poorer countries.

The western world didn&#39;t outsource squat.  These drug cartels in these countries are local - manned by locals.  That area is known as the Golden Triangle for being the hub of opium trade historically, and who knows what narcs these days.  They didn&#39;t need any Western influence to engage in this trade

That wasn&#39;t execution, that was murder.  There was not trial and conviction.

It&#39;s a phishing operation. Slashdot covers infosec. Slashdot has regularly reported on these scam centers over the years, including their efforts to secure internet access.

My Cambodian SIL got caught up in this; she and her boyfriend were basically abducted, driven to Myanmar and locked in one of these compounds. They were forced to work phone scams and were beaten if they didn&#39;t perform.

She managed to get a message to Hun Sen (over Facebook, of all places), and believe it or not, he listened. The Cambodian authorities worked with the Myanmar cops (who are NOTORIOUSLY CROOKED) and they raided the compound, freeing them and hundreds of other forced-labor workers (prisoners/slaves). So my SIL helped get them shut down and arrested, and now they&#39;ll all be executed and pushing up daisies.

The fact that there are even five different unions for the same company is excellent. Too many problems with unions in the US are caused by the fact that there is no competition between unions, and you can get forced to join the union in some states. No competition is always a bad sign.

Perhaps other countries could learn something here.

there are even five different unions for the same companyAs an additional detail, this is the normal situation there, all of these unions exist nationwide; two have members everywhere, one targets middle managers, and two target workers of the IT industry. If another studio would start an unrelated strike, you&#39;d likely see the same names. The idea of nationwide unions is they can ask members in other companies sharing similar preoccupations to join a strike nationwide.

If the workers had produced &quot;things of value&quot; in the past couple of years instead of uninspired, repetitive and boring slop, the company would not have been bought by Tencent. But the didn&#39;t and now Tencent is cleaning house.

I for one think it&#39;s a good thing that incompetence has consequences. And I hope Ubisoft can find its way again, and eventually starts delivering good games again.

I don&#39;t think you understand how games are made or how corporate decision making and execution works. Hint: it&#39;s a top-down system - 90% of the workers have very little say in what they do, they are hired to execute.

The workers produce what management tells them to, individual workers that don&#39;t produce what management requires would already have been fired. Any systemic failure is going to be down to management direction rather than failure of the lower level workers.

Not everything can be made to succeed.  It&#39;s totally possible that the buggy whip craftsmen and their managers didn&#39;t get the memo about autos and other consumer taste changes.

It would be a surefire way to get the company in trouble.What often happens is after negotiating something that costs the company or institution a lot of money, is that they don&#39;t replace workers who retire or otherwise leave.
Or just make a position redundant. Or outsource. 

The place I retired from had its unionized employee headcount shrink over 50 percent since the 1980&#39;s. Inverse of the rest of the place. Yeah, the remaining people were paid pretty well and had lots of bennies. It ends up like the old adage of &quot;I got mine, screw you!&quot; And further shrinkage

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, typing to you from underneath a sooty, icy snow boulder that has covered the entirety of D.C. for a week. But we’re not mad. Stop saying we’re mad.

Much of the week’s news revolved around the killing of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Republicans’ scrambling to limit the fallout. As the week went on, we got a new Fed chair announcement, Tulsi Gabbard showing up at an FBI raid in Georgia, and what appears to be a long weekend government shutdown? Don Lemon, you will have to wait until next week, sorry. If only the Surge could control the flow and spacing of news events, the world would run a lot smoother.

Let’s begin with the Cabinet member bearing most of the blame for the events of Minnesota.

The lack of turnover in the second Trump administration has been a marked difference from the first term. Top staff and Cabinet members aren’t getting axed left and right. The only high-level change we’ve seen has been former national security adviser Mike Waltz getting “demoted” to United Nations ambassador for getting slippery-fingered with his group chat invites. There’s a reason for this shift: President Donald Trump, as he reportedly felt during the deliberations over Waltz’s future, doesn’t want to give the liberal media a “scalp.” It’s a sign of weakness to, uh, provide accountability following screw-ups.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week seemed to come the closest a Cabinet official has come to a Trump axing this term. The administration flinched from its initial (and typical) belligerent messaging following the Customs and Border Protection killing of Pretti in Minneapolis. That left Noem out on a limb. It was Noem, after all, whose department oversaw the Minneapolis operation and Noem who, as the face of that department, said in the press conference afterward that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.” Democratic calls for her impeachment shot through the roof—and even some Republicans called on her to step down, as well. (More on that later.) Noem met with the president for two hours Monday night to plead her case. For now, it looks like Trump’s instincts not to give the media a “scalp” are winning out. Or, as with Waltz, he’s just waiting a spell for the fires to calm down before sending her on her way.

Noem wasn’t the only administration official rushing to call Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” White House policy chief and all-around architect of heavy-handedness Stephen Miller also called Pretti that, as well as an “assassin” looking to “murder” agents. Team Noem, in its effort to save her, went running to Axios to blame Miller for the incendiary language. We fully believe her. Immediately calling someone an “assassin” or “terrorist” without knowing much information is Miller’s M.O., and Miller is more powerful than Noem. Of course the administration’s ludicrous initial response was his handiwork.

Miller, however, is a master at deflecting consequences when his own aggressive policy views put the administration in hot water. During the outrage over family separation during Trump’s first term, then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lost her job while Miller mysteriously kept his, as journalist Jonathan Blitzer pointed out. Amid the Minnesota outrage, Noem is the Cabinet official in trouble, Border Patrol “commander” Greg Bovino was schlepped back to rural California to await his retirement, while Miller continues to run administration policy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for better or worse, summed up Miller’s job security accurately on Fox News this week. “To my colleagues who believe that you can convince Donald Trump that Stephen Miller is a liability for him, good luck with that,” he said. “When this clock strikes 12 on the Trump era, there will be a few people walking out the door with Donald Trump. Stephen Miller will be in that group.”

After the Pretti killing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took the position that Democrats wouldn’t advance a bill funding DHS without new reforms to immigration enforcement. The DHS funding was supposed to be included in a package with five other departmental funding bills and voted on this week, before a Friday night deadline. Schumer and Democrats demanded Republicans strip the DHS funding portion from the package, pass the other five, and buy a little time to work on DHS reforms. After a few days of talks, Senate Republicans and the White House … agreed to this! As we type, the Senate is slowly processing this agreement. (That’s Senate shorthand for waiting out a Lindsey Graham hissy fit.) Once they’re done, the House is expected to vote on the deal Monday. So there may be a wee technical funding gap for a few days, but nothing to write home about.

The deal extends DHS funding for only two weeks, setting up a sprint to legislate on the most contentious issue in politics. Schumer, with feedback from his caucus, has settled on three demands: ending roving patrols by ICE while tightening warrant rules, establishing a universal code of conduct governing federal law enforcement officers’ use of force, and barring officers from wearing masks while requiring them to turn on bodycams and have proper identification. These demands will run into issues from both directions. Progressives will (and are) chastising Democrats for asking for too little at a time when Republicans are reeling on this issue. And if DHS funding negotiations are going to be reopened, Republicans will put together their own series of requests targeting, for example, sanctuary cities. This won’t be easy.

Trump announced Friday morning that he would nominate financier Kevin Warsh to replace Jay Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve once Powell’s term ends in mid-May. Is this good? At least Trump picked someone from the requisite profession instead of a money-related figure from TV, such as Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo or pro wrestling’s Ted “Million Dollar Man” DiBiase. Warsh served on the Fed Board from 2006 to 2011 and worked closely with then-Chair Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis. He was Trump’s runner-up for the chairmanship in 2017, losing out to Powell. On another note, Warsh’s father-in-law is Ron Lauder, the cosmetics magnate and GOP donor responsible for putting the idea of annexing Greenland into Trump’s head.

If and when he is confirmed, the question will be to what extent he separates himself from the debasement he deployed to earn the job. Warsh was known for his hawkish monetary policy views following the 2008 financial crisis, worrying that lower interest rates then would cause inflation. (He was quite wrong about that.) But then he wanted to become Fed chair, and so his views have conveniently evolved. In a July interview, he described the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates” as a “mark against them” and added, “One of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” Was he saying what he needed to say to get the job, or does he intend to make interest rate decisions at the president’s urging?

The FBI raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia, on Wednesday because Donald Trump is out of his mind, and his political appointees will do whatever it takes to make him happy. The raid is related to Trump’s dangerous psychological holdup that he won the 2020 election, as well as a means of revenge against Fulton County for prosecuting him. And so a dozen or so agents dug around to search for “physical ballots from the 2020 general election,” per the warrant. If only this were all a joke. As Slate contributor Rick Hasen writes, the raid could be “a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026.” Democratic lawyers may want to consider ramping up their strength training ahead of the fall season.

The most hallucinatory part of the raid, though, may have been the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the scene. It had seemed as if Gabbard was mothballed since the administration took its turning toward bombing, or threatening the further bombing of, various countries. As the Wall Street Journal reported, though, Gabbard “has spent months investigating the results of the 2020 election” and is “leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes.” This is dark stuff. Playing gumshoe on conspiracy theories surrounding past domestic elections is not in the purview of the DNI’s office, and also, Gabbard is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Whatever report she reduces should, then, be laughable. The election-related executive orders it prompts Trump to release won’t be.

As we noted here a couple of weeks ago, retiring North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has been hammering Trump policy of late but has been loath to directly criticize the president himself. Tillis issued a blockade of Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve once Fed Chair Jay Powell announced he was under investigation, and he called the administration’s pursuit of annexing Greenland “stupid.” In both cases, he laid blame on Trump’s staff for giving him bad advice, rather than on the president for having a bad brain that thinks bad thoughts. Tillis came out firing again this week over the administration’s handling of the Pretti killing, calling for the firing of Kristi Noem. “I think what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters. Once again, though, he framed it in a way that absolved Trump: “It’s just amateurish. It’s terrible. It’s making the president look bad.”

So how does the president feel about this approach that Tillis has taken? Is he fooled by Tillis calling all of his administration’s policies stupid but saying it’s the advisers’ fault? “Well, they’re both losers,” Trump told ABC News on Wednesday of Tillis and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who had also called on Noem to resign. “You know, what can I tell you? They’re terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone.” Tillis’ response to being called a “loser” was, at least, clever. “I am thrilled about that. That makes me qualified to be homeland security secretary and senior adviser to the president,” referring to Noem and Stephen Miller, whom Tillis also despises. He is getting closer each week to blaming the person who continues to employ these chuckleheads and, thus, is responsible for them. Will he one day cross that line?

On Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was speaking at a district event when a man stood up, squirted her with some sort of liquid, and then was tackled to the ground and restrained by Omar’s security detail. Despite members of her team saying she should end her appearance to have tests of the liquid done, Omar insisted on continuing. The assailant, identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, had the sort of online posting history that you would expect and had told a neighbor that he might be arrested at an upcoming Omar event. He was charged with assault, and the liquid was determined to be apple cider vinegar and water. This story about his life is sad.

Omar was direct in pinning blame for the incident. “What the facts have shown since I’ve gotten into elected office,” she said Wednesday, “is that every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.” Indeed, Trump has directed years of racist invective toward Ilhan Omar, all of which has taken on a new acuity as the administration targets the Minnesota Somali community in general. The incident did not prompt a change of heart in Trump’s rhetoric toward Omar. “I think she’s a fraud,” he told ABC News. “I really don’t think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Lawyers love legal reasoning. It promises a clean, clear path through sticky, tricky territory. But legal reasoning can enable grotesque real-world outcomes, like torture, or arresting journalists, or masked government agents detaining and disappearing people. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is in conversation with Joseph Margulies, Professor of Practice of Government at Cornell University. Margulies litigated some of the biggest cases of egregious human rights violations of the post-9/11 “War on Terror”, an experience that informed his recent piece in the Boston Review: The Moral Stupefaction of America. Margulies explains how, when we allow obscure legal language to overshadow moral imperatives, we can end up in very dark places. The line from waterboarding at black sites to executing American citizens in the streets is a straight one. And there will be a lawyer willing to write a memo for all of it.

Why is the Trump administration arresting journalists and activists over a protest inside a Minnesota church? The official reason the government cited Friday—when it arrested independent journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, as well as two others—was that they were part of a “coordinated attack” on Cities Church in St. Paul. It’s a strange claim: Videos from the incident, which occurred Jan. 18, showed protesters being loud in interrupting a worship service, but not physically touching anyone or damaging any property. The protest may have been unpleasant for those in the pews—videos showed at least one man haranguing people for their complicity in supporting ICE—but it’s hardly an “attack.”

The incident has, however, gone viral in conservative media—proof positive of the degeneracy of the Minnesota protesters and yet another example of the left’s anti-Christian bigotry. Critics of the protest portrayed it as an intrusion of vulgar politics into a sacred refuge from daily life, a faceoff between vicious activists and apolitical (and bewildered) parishioners. For an administration obsessed with firing up its base supporters, arresting participants has an obvious political use. That’s especially true of Lemon, who because of his former job at CNN is a household name and much-reviled figure on the right.

But this isn’t just a case of red meat for the base. These activists have, perhaps inadvertently, come up against some very well-connected people. Despite efforts to portray it as an apolitical island of faith, Cities Church has extensive ties to a deeply political network within the larger Christian nationalism movement—a network with ties to the upper echelons of the Trump administration.

Some of the connections are obvious: The protest was aimed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who served as a lay pastor at the church. The pastor, David Easterwood, was not an employee of the church but one of a number of elders in it. He serves as the field officer for ICE’s operations in St. Paul and has appeared publicly with Kristi Noem. And Cities Church’s lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, primarily preaches of standard Biblical matters, but he’s not above politics—or broadcasting about it on social media. He has discussed the evils of “transgenderism” and called the pope an “idiot.”

But the more important ties go deeper. Cities Church was founded 11 years ago by a group of theologically conservative men, including a pastor named Joe Rigney. Rigney is no longer a pastor at Cities Church, but he still speaks for it in conservative media appearances. “This is not a political church,” he told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum. “This is a church that worships Jesus. Loves one another. Seeks the good of their neighbors.”

“It’s a normal congregation of Christian worshippers,” he said on a separate Fox News segment, speaking to Harris Faulkner. “Every town in this country is filled with people like this who want to worship Jesus, love one another, serve their neighbor, seek the good of these cities.”

But Rigney himself is focused on much more than worshiping Jesus and loving one another. Rigney is currently a pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Christ Church is an extremely controversial church, known for essentially taking over the town as part of a religious effort led by a pastor named Doug Wilson. Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches have hard-right views on women’s rights, including opposition to women’s suffrage. Wilson has also begun an effort to expand his sphere of influence into Washington: He opened a second campus of Christ Church in D.C. in 2025 with the explicit goal of molding powerful Republicans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a church affiliated with the network.

“With the change in administration, we believe that there will be many strategic opportunities with numerous evangelicals who will be present both in and around the Trump administration,” Wilson wrote in a blog post at the time. “These believers are obviously culturally engaged already, but we happen to believe that every form of cultural engagement needs to have a solid theological foundation and support, and we want to help to provide it.”

Rigney, as part of this movement, is a highly political figure. He comments on partisan politics on social media, calling, for example, to end Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage. He has written an entire book criticizing “the sin of empathy.” He has appeared on chummy podcasts with William Wolfe, a Baptist activist and author who wrote of Alex Pretti’s killing: “Another foolish person has lost their life trying to obstruct ICE. Here’s my reaction: I don’t care.”

There’s a legitimate debate over how to treat worship spaces in a time of encroaching authoritarianism. But in its discussion of the church protest, conservative media—and now the Trump administration—have presented it as a struggle between leftists and apolitical Christians. That’s a lie: The conversation around the St. Paul church protest should not assume political intentions on just one side.

In the wake of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti during Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, the closest thing to “accountability” we’ve seen is Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino being sent back to California. It’s not enough but it’s something.

Late Thursday night, former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested by federal agents at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Independent journalist Georgia Fort was arrested as well, along with activists Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy. The arrests stem from a protest at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the pastor is also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Protesters entered the church chanting “ICE out,” disrupting services. Troubling though this may be—places of worship have often been considered off-limits for political protest—the protesters did not assault anyone or even destroy property. Whatever protesters did or didn’t do, Lemon was not demonstrating; he identified himself as a journalist and was clear he was documenting the protest, not participating in it. These arrests came after the Trump Department of Justice’s original criminal complaint against Lemon was rejected because a federal judge—a man who was a former clerk for conservative icon Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and a George W. Bush appointee—found there was no probable cause to arrest him.

Still, Lemon found himself under arrest for the crime of doing journalism. The White House tweeted out: “When life gets you lemons…” followed by two chain emojis and an image of Lemon, accusing him of “involvement in the St. Paul church riots.”

Even for an administration that has spent a year violating the First Amendment in all kinds of novel ways, the arrest of a prominent journalist is a shock—a five-alarm fire moment.

It also shows just how far this administration is willing to go to solidify its control. And it raises the question of just how far Donald Trump’s most loyal followers will follow him. Already, some of them have ceded their fealty to their most valued constitutional amendment—not the First, but the Second. And that willingness to quickly shake off once-sacrosanct beliefs does not bode well for all of our freedoms to speak, protest, and publish.

The Second Amendment, conservatives and Supreme Court justices have complained, is a “disfavored right.” In arguments earlier this month over a Hawaii gun law that limited the ability of people to carry a concealed weapon onto private property, Chief Justice John Roberts asked Neal Katyal, the attorney for the state of Hawaii, why a political candidate door-knocking could under the First Amendment approach private homes and make his case, but under Hawaii’s law couldn’t do so with a gun on him. The conservative justices seemed largely united in their view that the Second Amendment allows an expansive individual right to carry a firearm—a right that is just as expansive as the First Amendment’s protections of free speech and assembly.

Just days after those oral arguments, Alex Pretti was shot multiple times by Customs and Border Protection agents. The conservative reaction to his killing has raised important questions of just how much the right actually cares about gun rights, if the person exercising those rights is a liberal. But it’s raised even more important, and less-discussed, questions about the First Amendment, and the troubling ways in which the rights to speak and protest are being aggressively eroded by this administration and its supporters—including the one-time self-styled conservative warriors for free speech.

This administration’s about-face on the Second Amendment has rightly merited accusations of hypocrisy, and has signaled the willingness of its followers to again relinquish a once-foundational principle out of unbroken loyalty to their Dear Leader. In reality, though, this administration is not going to strip gun rights away from American citizens—at least not those who support the MAGA movement. Despite Trump’s complaints about guns at anti-ICE actions, the legal interpretations of the Second Amendment will likely only grow more ludicrously capacious under this regime.

The First Amendment, though, is a different matter. And it’s the rights within it—to assemble, to speak, to protest, to practice one’s religion, to petition one’s government, to a free press—that are quickly becoming, to both paraphrase Roberts and understate the urgency of the matter, disfavored.

In Minneapolis, Pretti’s gun was holstered. He wasn’t wielding it or intimidating anyone with it, let alone threatening anyone’s life. The Trump administration has nevertheless branded him a “domestic terrorist” and a “would-be assassin.” They have suggested that any opponent of the administration who peacefully exercises their Second Amendment right might forfeit their right to life.

And even more troubling: The administration and its agents are arguing that opponents might lose their lives or their liberty for peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights.

“When politicians, community leaders, and some journalists engage in that heated rhetoric we keep talking about, when they make the choice to vilify law enforcement, calling law enforcement names like Gestapo or using the term kidnapping, that is a choice that has made their actions and consequences that come from those choices,” Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino said in a press conference over the weekend. “When someone chooses to listen to a politician, a so-called journalist, or a community leader that spouts that type of vilification towards law enforcement or anything else … there are consequences and actions there also, I think we saw that yesterday.”

The “consequences” he’s referring to: Alex Pretti’s death.

Bovino is not the only administration official who has implied that the consequences for free speech might be death. “For months, we’ve been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in early January. “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

Last summer, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin claimed that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents” and threatened to “prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law” (photographing and videotaping law enforcement in public is legally protected behavior). Noem defined as “violence” “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.”

White House border czar Tom Homan also blamed “the rhetoric,” not trigger-happy agents, for violence against demonstrators. “I said in March—if the rhetoric doesn’t stop, there is gonna be bloodshed,” he said at a press conference on Thursday. “And there has been.” What Homan actually said back in March was this: “Do I expect violence to escalate? Absolutely.” In February, he warned, “I’m coming to Boston and I’m bringing Hell with me.” Over the summer, he publicly fantasized about beating up a Democratic member of Congress.

In his most recent press conference, Homan referred to ICE agents in Minneapolis as being in “theater”—a term usually used for a region to which soldiers are deployed in combat.

ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents seem to have gotten the message that they are at war, that the penalty for speech they don’t like might be death, and that they have free rein to assault or even kill those who offend, challenge, or simply just annoy them. “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” one officer is seen on video saying to an observer. “Listen, have y’all not learned from the past couple of days?” another agent asked citizens who were (legally) filming him in public soon after the Renee Good killing. “Have you not learned?” Agents have, without charges, been detaining witnesses to their violence, it seems to simply intimidate them into shutting up. Yet another federal agent told a woman filming him, “We have a nice little database and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”

After Good’s killing, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act “if the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.” Members of his administration have defined “attacking” ICE as filming them, alerting the public to their presence, or calling them fascists—all protected forms of speech, protest, and expression. Right-wing members of the House have renewed calls for the use of the Insurrection Act in the wake of Pretti’s killing. The Insurrection Act would allow Trump to put U.S. soldiers on the streets, and while it does not impose martial law or formally suspend the civil liberties guaranteed to Americans by the Constitution, it is an enormous escalation that treats protesters as domestic enemies. It would almost surely curtail civil liberties by default, if not by law. And while it briefly seemed that Trump and administration officials had somewhat cooled their rhetoric in the wake of a mass publish backlash over the Pretti killing, their arrest of Lemon suggests that they’ve again changed tactics—and that they remain willing to bring the full force of the federal government down on U.S. citizens simply for exercising their First Amendment rights.

This is all coming in the context of an administration that has been more overtly hostile to the First Amendment rights of free speech and expression than any in modern history. The FBI recently searched the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson, claiming they were looking for “illegal leaks”; Natanson had been reporting on the administration’s gutting of the federal workforce. Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was walking home when masked federal agents grabbed her off of the street, forced her into a van, and ferried her off to a detention center thousands of miles away where they continued deportation proceedings against her—not because she had broken the law, but because the government didn’t like the content of a pro-Palestinian op-ed she wrote. Emmy Award–winning journalist Mario Guevara, who spent two decades covering immigration and the Latino community in Atlanta and had a valid work permit, was arrested by ICE, detained for more than 100 days, and eventually deported to El Salvador. The administration claimed Guevara’s filming of ICE officers—his reporting—constituted a risk to public safety. Retired police officer Larry Bushart of Tennessee was arrested and jailed for more than a month over a Facebook post about Charlie Kirk (the post quoted Trump saying “we have to get over it” about a school shooting).

The existing infringements on the First Amendment have been bad. But what this administration is signaling may be coming could be much worse.

Back in September, the White House released a memo promising to crack down on “domestic terrorism,” which they say is “under the umbrella of self-described ‘anti-fascism.’ ” When it comes to anti-fascism, the memo says, “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” Acts of domestic terrorism, they say, include “doxing”—which the administration has defined as simply identifying an ICE officer—and “civil disorder,” by which they mean protest.

Many conservatives spent the whole of the Biden administration crowing about infringements on their First Amendment rights—the wokescolds who wouldn’t let them use racial slurs anymore, the tyrannical government that set limits on public gatherings in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Now that their side is in charge, though, any commitment to the freedoms of speech and assembly seems to have evaporated in favor of retribution and crushing the opposition. This is exceedingly dangerous: Rights are meaningless if the only people who have them are those the regime believes will submit.

Liberals should hope that the administration’s willingness to infringe upon Second Amendment freedoms will be a wake-up call to the gun-obsessed right. Maybe threats to the Second Amendment, even if they’re largely rhetorical, will make a few conservatives take notice of how this regime is on a mission to actually obliterate the First.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly every company, from tech giants like Amazon to small startups, has first-hand experience with fake IT workers applying for jobs - and sometimes even being hired.

Even so, using a deepfake video to apply for a security researcher role with a company that does threat modeling for AI systems seems incredibly brash.

&quot;It&#39;s one of the most common discussion points that pops up in the CISO groups I&#39;m in,&quot; Expel co-founder and CEO Jason Rebholz told The Register, talking about the North Korean-type job interview scam.  &quot;I did not think it was going to happen to me, but here we are.&quot;

Before starting his own AI security shop, Rebholz worked as an incident responder and chief information security officer (CISO). He has researched deepfakes for years, and even used them in his presentations - so he&#39;s not an easy target for this type of scam.

In January, Rebholz posted a few job openings at his firm on LinkedIn. Within a couple hours, he received a direct message from someone he didn&#39;t know personally saying that they knew someone who would be a good candidate for the security researcher role.

The purported job-seeker&#39;s profile pic wasn&#39;t of a real person. Rebholz says it looked like an anime character, and calls it the &quot;first red flag&quot; in this whole experience. But he still gave the candidate the benefit of the doubt.

&quot;In the security community, people get freaked out about privacy, and so it&#39;s not outside of the norm if somebody has an alias or don&#39;t have a real picture,&quot; he said. &quot;This was the first instance of me trying to justify what I was seeing.&quot;

Rebholz asked his LinkedIn connection about the job seeker, and the connection send him a link to a resume hosted on Vercel, a cloud platform for building apps that integrates with AI tools. That also seemed a little strange.

&quot;I&#39;m chatting with my co-founder at the time and he said, &#39;that&#39;s kind of weird. He probably used Claude to generate that resume,&#39;&quot; Rebholz said, adding that if you ask Claude Code to create a resume or portfolio, it typically deployed these on Vercel.

Rebholz justified this by telling himself the guy&#39;s a developer, it makes sense that he&#39;d use a coding tool to create a portfolio, plus, &quot;it was a good-looking resume. It all looked really professional.&quot;

The LinkedIn contact said he previously worked with the job seeker at his last company, and told Rebholz the would-be security researcher worked overseas. Rebholz said that wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Expel&#39;s a young company, and Rebholz wanted to interview as many people as he could to get a sense of who was right for the job.

&quot;At this point, I didn&#39;t suspect it was a scam,&quot; he said. &quot;It felt a little bit weird with the person, being overseas, even though the last job that they had was in San Francisco.&quot;

Still, Rebholz figured he could ask about this in the interview. He gave the LinkedIn person his email address, asked the mutual &quot;friend&quot; to make the connection, &quot;and within five minutes of the email hitting my inbox, I have a LinkedIn message saying: &#39;Check your spam folder, he replied to you, make sure you reply to him.&#39;&quot;

Rebholz started to suspect he was getting scammed. &quot;I&#39;ve never had that level of urgency for an introduction before,&quot; he said. Every security sleuth - or anyone who has gone through anti-phishing training - knows that attackers typically try to create a sense of urgency to get their mark to take a certain action.

When we had the interview, that&#39;s when things just went off the rails right away

&quot;But I thought, all right, let me just talk with them. No harm there. And so we got an interview scheduled,&quot; Rebholz said. &quot;I didn&#39;t reach a point yet where the red flags cross that threshold where I thought this is definitely a scam. We were in the yellow zone. Things were definitely getting a little suspicious. But when we had the interview, that&#39;s when things just went off the rails right away.&quot;

The scammer joined the call with his camera off. Then it took him a good 30 seconds to turn his camera on. &quot;During that 30 seconds, I&#39;m thinking this is going to be a deep fake, all those red flags started popping up from before, this is definitely not going to be real,&quot; Rebholz said.

When the camera turned on, the job seeker was sitting in front of a virtual background - you can see a clip here - his face looked a bit blurry and plastic, there was a greenscreen reflected in his glasses, and at one point dimples appeared on his face.

&quot;At that point, I was latching on to the softness of his face, and as he was moving around you could see if appearing and disappearing,&quot; Rebholz said. &quot;At this point, I know I&#39;m definitely talking to a deepfake. But again, I tried to justify it.&quot;

During our interview, Rebholz repeatedly describes an &quot;inner turmoil&quot; he experienced during this process. &quot;What if I&#39;m wrong? Even though I&#39;m 95 percent sure I&#39;m right here, what if I&#39;m wrong and I&#39;m impacting another human&#39;s ability to get a job? That was literally the dialog that was going on in my head, even though I knew it was a deep fake the whole time. It was this weird juxtaposition. I found myself short circuiting to: there could be an explanation for what I&#39;m seeing. It was a very surreal experience.&quot;

What if I&#39;m wrong? Even though I&#39;m 95 percent sure I&#39;m right here, what if I&#39;m wrong and I&#39;m impacting another human&#39;s ability to get a job?

Rebholz says he noticed that the job seeker had a tendency to repeat the interview questions back before answering them, and many of his answers were almost word-for-word quotes of things Rebholz had said or written that were shared online. &quot;It was almost an out-of-body experience where I felt like I was talking to myself,&quot; he said.

Rebholz never ended the interview or asked the candidate to prove his humanness. &quot;This was the inner turmoil I was going through: Do I confront him? But I kept going back to: What if I&#39;m wrong? That was the oddest part of the whole experience because everything in me, everything I know about deepfakes was screaming at me: This is a deep fake. But there was something blocking me, the 1 percent chane that I&#39;m wrong, this is actually a good candidate, and he&#39;s going to think poorly of me if I confront him.&quot;

After the interview, Rebholz said the video clips to his friend at Moveris to analyze using the company&#39;s deepfake detection tech. It confirmed Rebholz&#39;s suspicions. And one of the lessons learned is that it can happen to anyone, at any sized company.

&quot;Small companies are also victims,&quot; Rebholz said. &quot;You don&#39;t need to be a massive tech company to be a victim.&quot;

Massive tech companies like Google and Amazon are also being targeted by North Korean IT workers. In fact, most Fortune 500 companies have fallen for the scam.

In December, Amazon said it stopped more than 1,800 suspected scammers from the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) from joining its workforce since April 2024.

&quot;And we&#39;ve detected 27 percent more DPRK-affiliated applications quarter over quarter this year,&quot; Amazon Chief Security Officer Steve Schmidt said.

Rebholz said the issue comes up at least once a month in CISO chat groups he belongs to, and everyone is trying to figure out the best way to solve the problem.

&quot;It&#39;s got to be a mix of low-tech and high-solutions, low-tech being just call it out,&quot; Rebholz said. &quot;The biggest learning for me is: trust your gut. Moving forward, the rule I have is forget about the social awkwardness. It&#39;s more important to just challenge upfront and have that awkward conversation than it is to waste your time.&quot;

It can cost execs and their companies a lot more than just their time. This type of IT worker fraud has cost cost American businesses tens of millions of dollars.

&quot;If that person gets hired, you have a potential risk to the company, whether it&#39;s a security incident where that individual is stealing information, or you&#39;re paying a criminal,&quot; Rebholz said.

In some cases, the fraudsters use their insider access to steal proprietary source code and other sensitive data, and then extort their employers with threats to leak corporate data unless a ransom is paid.

In addition to trusting your gut, Rebholz suggests mandating the camera stays on during job interviews, and if the interviewee is using a virtual background, tell them to turn it off. If they refuse, end the interview.

&quot;If you&#39;re still suspicious for whatever reason, go ask them to pick something up in their background and bring it back to the desk,&quot; Rebholz said. &quot;The old school thing of having them wave their hand in front of their face - that&#39;s completely dead.&quot; Modern deepfake software can defeat that trick, he added.

After hiring an applicant for a job, require them to work on-site for the first week, even if it&#39;s a remote position. &quot;It&#39;s all about adding a little bit of friction for this person who is trying to get through the interview process,&quot; Rebholz said, noting that one CISO told him that the person who showed up on day one - the only day they were required to work on-site - wasn&#39;t the same person the executive team had interviewed.

The scammers &quot;had hired somebody to come into the office for the first day before they were able to go remote,&quot; he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The British Army&#39;s ill-fated Ajax armored vehicle program now faces the prospect of being axed as the Ministry of Defence withdraws its initial operating capability status and reviews its future.

Ajax, a tracked reconnaissance vehicle intended for the Army&#39;s Armoured Brigade Combat and Artillery Fire Support Teams, has been in the news off and on due to reports of it causing health problems among the crew.

Initial operating capability (IOC) was declared for the platform last November, amidst assurances that any issues with the units, which resemble smallish tanks, had been ironed out. But a number of service personnel have since reported symptoms consistent with noise and vibration effects during training exercises, leading to it being put on hold last week.

This week, Defence Secretary John Healey told the Parliamentary Defence Committee: &quot;It is clear we did not have the full facts in the lead-up to decisions about the initial operating capability.&quot;

That IOC has now been withdrawn, and the Army is no longer in charge of this program, with responsibility passed instead to the National Armaments Director, as The Register reported.

But Healey went further, telling the committee: &quot;I have been clear that we must back it or scrap it. The work is being done at the moment in order to put us in a position to make that decision.&quot;

This appears to confirm that the government may be preparing to cancel Ajax if the outstanding issues with the vehicle cannot be easily addressed.

Neither option is particularly palatable, as critics have alleged that some flaws in the vehicle&#39;s chassis - built by contractor General Dynamics - may be contributing to the ongoing problems.

But a decision to scrap the vehicles would cause a different headache, as the program is already years behind schedule and it would effectively mean starting over with a selection process to find a replacement, while the Ministry of Defence is said to be facing a budget shortfall already.

Ajax is also the name for the overarching program, which aims to fill six different roles for the Army, based on the same chassis. Ares is an armored personnel carrier, Athena is a command vehicle, Argus is the engineering version, Atlas is a recovery vehicle, and Apollo is a repair unit.

It is understood that about 170 vehicles have so far been delivered, covering all of these roles, with the largest number being the Ajax reconnaissance unit.

Alternatives to take the place of Ajax could be the CV90 from BAE Systems or the Rheinmetall Lynx, both of which are already in service with other European armies.

Another option is to simply develop a reconnaissance variant of the Boxer Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV), now entering service with the British Army. Boxer has a modular design that allows mission-specific modules to be fitted to its eight-wheeled chassis.

The Ministry was asked to confirm whether axing Ajax is being considered, but a spokesperson merely pointed us to an earlier statement from the Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry, Luke Pollard MP, who said: &quot;We will need to decide on the platform&#39;s future shortly, and that is being considered as part of the forthcoming Defence Investment Plan.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic&#39;s Claude machine learning model has boldly planned what no Claude has planned before – a path across Mars for NASA&#39;s Perseverance rover.

Perseverance traveled about 400 meters on the Martian surface last month based on an AI-generated path. It did so with the blessing of engineers at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), who decided to delegate the meticulous work of route planning to Anthropic&#39;s AI model.

As Anthropic explains in its writeup of the milestone, the surface of Mars can be treacherous for rovers. No one wants to be responsible for getting pricey space kit stuck in the sand, as happened with the Spirit rover in 2009.

So the Perseverance team spends a fair amount of time on route planning. This involves consulting orbital and surface imagery of Mars in order to set a series of waypoints to guide the rover&#39;s movements. Once plotted, this data gets transmitted about 140 million miles or 225 million kilometers – the average distance from Earth to Mars – where it&#39;s received by Perseverance as a navigational plan. Live-driving via joystick isn&#39;t feasible given the distance involved.

Perseverance has an AutoNav system that handles real-time decision making. &quot;AutoNav allows the rover to autonomously re-plan its route around rocks or other obstacles on its way to a pre-established destination,&quot; NASA explains.

The re-planning may not be needed if the pre-planning went well.

The pre-planning is &quot;time-consuming&quot; and &quot;laborious,&quot; as Anthropic puts it, so JPL researchers decided to let Claude – using its vision capabilities – have a go.

&quot;Generative AI provided the analysis of the high-resolution orbital imagery from the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera aboard NASA&#39;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and terrain-slope data from digital elevation models,&quot; JPL said in an online post. &quot;After identifying critical terrain features – bedrock, outcrops, hazardous boulder fields, sand ripples, and the like – it generated a continuous path complete with waypoints.&quot;

Claude generated Rover commands in Rover Markup Language (RML), which is based on XML. The version of Claude available on the web could not emit RML when asked and initially denied any knowledge of RML. When pointed to Anthropic&#39;s statement on the matter, Claude responded, &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right, and I apologize for my initial response!&quot; Nonetheless, Claude could not provide an example of RML, a shortcoming that the model attributed to the lack of a publicly documented standard.

But Claude evidently did generate RML when it had access to NASA&#39;s data. And that&#39;s when the humans took the opportunity to check the route plan. AI models make mistakes and, even if that weren&#39;t a concern, that&#39;s just the sort of thing one does when programming rovers on other planets. Using a simulator representing a virtual replica of the rover, JPL engineers checked more than 500,000 telemetry variables about the rover&#39;s projected position and potential obstacles. And they made corrections.

&quot;When the JPL engineers reviewed Claude&#39;s plans, they found that only minor changes were needed,&quot; Anthropic said. &quot;For instance, ground-level camera images (which Claude hadn&#39;t seen) gave a clearer view of sand ripples on either side of a narrow corridor; the rover drivers elected to split the route more precisely than Claude had at this point. But otherwise, the route held up well. The plans were sent to Mars, and the rover successfully traversed the planned path.&quot;

On Martian days (sols) 1,707 and 1,709 (starting from the landing date 18 February 2021 at 08.55pm GMT), which corresponded to December 8 and December 10, 2025, Perseverance executed routes planned by AI instead of humans.

The rover didn&#39;t follow the set route exactly. NASA&#39;s image of the December 10 path shows that the pre-planned route and the actual route differ slightly, presumably based on decisions made by the AutoNav system. But AI played a role, one many models can be expected to reprise as vision-language-actions models become more capable and get stuffed into robots.

&quot;This demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds,&quot; said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman in a statement. &quot;Autonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It&#39;s a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations.&quot;

Anthropic reports that JPL engineers say Claude can cut the time required for route planning in half. The AI biz however failed specify the amount of time being halved. Representatives of Anthropic and JPL couldn&#39;t immediately be reached to quantify that fraction. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive Broadcom this week brought the hammer down on the Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service Providers (VCSPs) – and the clock is now ticking for any third parties working to close sales.

For customers, this potentially represents a massive supplier shake-up, with sources claiming that hundreds of CSPs across Europe are affected.

The news may not come as a shock to Reg readers because the direction of travel was indicated when Broadcom shuttered VMware&#39;s reseller/solution provider schemes in early 2024 and moved to the invite-only Broadcom Advantage Partner Program. Broadcom has also started to license new bundles, including products previously sold as standalone, and altered support for perpetual license holders.

Dramatic changes also hit cloud service providers. Broadcom gave notice on October 31 that it was phasing out the VCSP program and sunsetting the White Label model for partners in the European Economic Area. It is now moving to an invite-only model with fewer authorized providers and this week informed affected partners.

On Monday, in a non-renewal email seen by The Register, Broadcom said: &quot;We are providing this formal notice that we have closed the current Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service Provider (VCSP) partners, and will not be renewing any of your VCSP partner contracts with Broadcom after 26 January 2026.&quot;

&quot;You may continue to transact new and existing coterminous customer opportunities through the end of your current commitment contract term. The term for any new contracts executed during this period must be coterminous with a current active commitment contract that you have with Broadcom. However, we encourage you to close any open opportunities you may be pursuing by 31 March 2026.&quot;

In an FAQ document also seen by El Reg, Broadcom said the reason for not continuing with certain authorized VCSPs pertains to &quot;evolving customer requirements&quot; – it didn&#39;t specify what these are – and to &quot;enable increased adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation as the core private cloud platform.&quot; This means Broadcom needs to &quot;work more closely with a focused set of partners.&quot;

CSPs may &quot;execute&quot; new coterminous customer contracts and keep servicing existing customers under VCSP commitments for the remainder of the contract terms with Broadcom, their Cloud Commerce Manager, or their Primary White Label Provider partners.

&quot;You may not execute any new Aggregate commitment contracts nor any renewals for existing commitment contracts, so that a timely and orderly wind-down of the current Program can become effective at the end of your existing commitment contract term(s),&quot; the notice states.

The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers of Europe trade group (CISPE), which is pressing the European Commission to overturn its approval of Broadcom&#39;s buy of VMware on antitrust grounds, was damning of the January 26 notification. One of its members, Estonia-based WaveCom, said it has invested in VMware for 15 years.

Kristian Liivak, CTO and founder of WaveCom AS, said a &quot;bulldozer named Broadcom&quot; has &quot;finally rolled over the remaining EU cloud service providers, terminating almost all VMware partner contracts.&quot;

&quot;This process had already taken place elsewhere in the world. In the United States, for example, only 19 providers reportedly remain out of thousands. Now the same approach has reached Europe.&quot;

Liivak said VMware, under Broadcom&#39;s ownership, has &quot;dismantled&quot; the partner network, beginning with &quot;predatory contractual terms and aggressive pricing changes.&quot; He claimed the &quot;long onboarding queues of enterprise customers disappeared almost overnight.&quot;

WaveCom previously started to build a virtualization stack based on Apache CloudStack and the EU-based Vates and Xen.

&quot;We still carry long-term government procurement obligations and enterprise contracts. It remains unclear how all customers will transition – whether they will move with us to the new platform or whether contractual challenges will arise due to the forced termination of the VMware ecosystem.&quot;

In its FAQ document, Broadcom covered what happens to customers managed by a non-renewing partner, saying: &quot;Non-renewing partners are encouraged to engage with retained VCSP partners to ensure a smooth transition for customers.&quot;

Liivak said: &quot;We will not disappear quietly into the night. And we will not hand our customers over to the remaining few providers, as implied by Broadcom&#39;s termination notice.&quot;

Another CSP source told us: &quot;This isn&#39;t partner management, it&#39;s market control, a forced consolidation that sidelines long-standing European partners in favor of a much narrower and more limiting ecosystem. Broadcom is deliberately shrinking the choice for customers who will end up paying the price through higher costs, less data sovereignty, compliance concerns, and ultimately reduced choice.&quot;

The Register has asked Broadcom to comment on how many CSPs will be joining its invite-only channel program, how many were not renewed and what if customers don&#39;t want to move to a new supplier.

&quot;Broadcom&#39;s strategy since closing the VMware acquisition has been to drive simplification, consistency, and innovation across the VMware ecosystem, including VMware Cloud Services Providers (VCSPs). Recent changes to this ecosystem are consistent with this strategy. Broadcom is focusing more and going deeper with the VCSPs who have demonstrated commitment to their cloud services built on VMware. This will enable us to deliver greater value, stronger execution, and a more streamlined experience for Broadcom&#39;s customers and enable an alternative competitive offering to the hyperscalers through our VCSP partners.&quot; ®

            <h2>January blues return as Ivanti coughs up exploited EPMM zero-days</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/ivanti_epmm_zero_days/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ivanti has patched two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in its Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) product that are already being exploited, continuing a grim run of January security incidents for enterprise IT vendors.

In January 2025, tens of thousands were urged to patch a Fortinet zero-day, while Ivanti customers were doing the same. There has been little change this year as Fortinet patches multiple single sign-on (SSO) flaws and Ivanti ships fixes for yet another pair of zero-days.

Tracked as CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, both bugs affect Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM). They&#39;re also both rated a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.8 and allow for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) – about as bad as it gets.

The security shop said in its advisory: &quot;We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.

&quot;This vulnerability does not impact any other Ivanti products, including any cloud products, such as Ivanti Neurons for MDM. Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) is a different product and also not impacted by these vulnerabilities. Customers using an Ivanti cloud product with Sentry are also not impacted by this vulnerability.&quot;

These kinds of RCE bugs can lead to all sorts of nastiness. Lateral movement across a given organization&#39;s network, config changes, and attackers making themselves admin are all possible. The vendor warned that it could grant access to certain data too.

Ivanti said that the types of information available could include basic personal information about the EPMM admin and device user, as well as information about mobile devices such as phone numbers and GPS locations.

Those looking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) are out of luck. Ivanti doesn&#39;t have any reliable ones due to the small number of impacted customers it knows about.

It does, however, have a technical analysis page, which includes more general information about how to detect potential exploits.

The Apache access log is a good place to start for threat hunters. Specifically, they should be looking at the In-House Application Distribution and the Android File Transfer Configuration features. Legitimate traffic leads to 200 HTTP response codes while potential exploit activity may result in 404s.

&quot;We recommend reviewing these and any other GET requests with parameters that have bash commands,&quot; Ivanti said.

This is not the first time in recent memory that EPMM has been hit by RCE bugs, and previous analyses have shown attackers tend to use two common methods of persistence. More often than not, it&#39;s introducing or modifying web shells, typically targeting error pages such as 401.jsp, the vendor said.

&quot;Any requests to these pages with POST methods or with parameters should be considered highly suspicious.&quot;

Ivanti also advised defenders to look out for unexpected WAR or JAR files being introduced to the system, as it could be a sign of attackers deploying reverse shell connections.

EPMM also does not usually make outbound network connections, so any signs of this in the firewall logs should be treated as a sign to investigate.

If a customer does find signs of compromise, Ivanti said it&#39;s best to just restore from backups – don&#39;t bother trying to clean the system – and then upgrade to the latest relevant version.

Alternatively, if going down the backup route isn&#39;t an option, Ivanti suggests building a replacement EPMM device and migrating data onto it.

Benjamin Harris, CEO at watchTowr, said that a &quot;wide range&quot; of its customers who have EPMM running belong to high-value industries, warning others to act fast.

He said: &quot;We knew January seemed too calm. Ivanti&#39;s EPMM solution, the center point of previous zero-day sagas, is once again receiving in-the-wild exploitation by seemingly capable and well-resourced threat actors.

&quot;CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 – unauthenticated RCE vulnerabilities within Ivanti&#39;s Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) – represent the worst of the worst, with threat actors actively compromising systems and deploying backdoors.

&quot;While patches are available from Ivanti, applying patches will not be enough. Threat actors have been exploiting these vulnerabilities as zero-days, and organizations that are, as of disclosure, exposing vulnerable instances to the internet must consider them compromised, tear down infrastructure, and instigate incident response processes.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lying means dying, at least for one falsehood-peddling government AI. A Microsoft-powered chatbot that New York City rolled out to help business owners answer frequently asked questions – but was often wrong – has been silenced as the city grapples with a $12 billion budget shortfall.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani said that, while the cash saved is only a fraction of what is needed to fund the budget, it was emblematic of how the last administration spent taxpayer money.

“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable, and was costing the administration around a half a million dollars,” Mamdani said in a Wednesday press conference. “That in and of itself is not something that can bridge this gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”

The chatbot was announced in October 2023 as part of then-Mayor Eric Adams&#39; New York City Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. It was meant to give business owners and entrepreneurs actionable and trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC business web pages and articles on topics such as compliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best practices to avoid violations and fines, Adams said at the time.

“For the first time New York City business and aspiring entrepreneurs will be able to direct their questions to an AI-powered chatbot rather than having to scan through webpage after webpage going into the blackhole of uncertainty about how to open a business, how to run a business, how to answer some of the basic questions,” he said during the announcement. “That is behind us. AI-generated answering is in front of us.”

However local news outlet The Markup tested the bot, it gave questioners the wrong answers, telling would-be landlords they did not have to accept tenants on housing assistance, and that they could set rents as high as they wished.

It said businesses could go cashless, even though the city council passed a measure in 2020 that required businesses to accept cash, and that it was ok for businesses to take employees&#39; tips and to conceal some funeral costs.

While the city did say in 2023 that the bot may hallucinate, the new administration credited the news outlet for alerting it to the problematic bot. The Register reached out to Microsoft for comment on Friday afternoon but did not receive an immediate response.

The New York bot isn’t the first one to run amok.

Air Canada used an AI-powered chatbot that gave the wrong advice about discounts, while other chatbots are accused of being complicit in harm to children, including suicide.

A Canadian tribunal found that Air Canada was bound by what its bot said. Earlier this month, Google and Character AI offered to settle lawsuits brought by families in Florida, Colorado, New York, and Texas whose children either died or were harmed after interactions with those bots. ®

            <div id="article-text">Internet shutdowns, smuggled Starlink terminals, and state-sponsored AI slop.

After protests broke out in early January, the Iranian regime shut down the internet, starting the longest blackout in Iranian history. Despite this attempt to stop the protests from spreading, they did not stop. Still, the internet shutdown slowed down the spread of information both inside and outside Iran.

Behind the heavily policed borders and the jammed signals, an unprecedented wave of state violence continues to add to a death toll somewhere between 3,000 and 30,000. Even at the lowest count, which has been acknowledged by the Iranian state and is likely a wild underestimate, these last few weeks have been one of the bloodiest uprisings in modern history.

The situation in Iran can be hard to grasp. The history is complicated; the state of the technology and internet infrastructure there is constantly in flux. To get a sense of what is happening right now, I turned to an expert. Mahsa Alimardani, the associate director of the Technology Threats & Opportunities program at WITNESS, has been a researcher and advocate in the digital rights space — particularly around Iran — since 2012. I spoke with her about what is happening in Iran, and how technology both props up and threatens repressive regimes.

The Verge: What is internet access in Iran like right now?

Mahsa Alimardani: Since the weekend [of January 24], there has been some resumption of connectivity. And I’m a little bit worried that this might convince people that things are back to normal. Last I saw, there was like 30 to 40 percent connectivity on some of the Cloudflare network data in Iran and there’s very inconsistent connectivity. Some circumvention tools have started to work.

Randomly, someone in Iran FaceTime called me yesterday. They were like, “My VPN stopped working, so I just tried to call with FaceTime, and for some reason, it didn’t even need a VPN.” But it was a momentary glitch. Various things are happening across the network, and it’s not really clear why there’s this opening, or what it means for long-term connectivity.

Since January 8th, when there was a surge in the uprising in the protest movement in Iran, there was an internet shutdown — the longest internet shutdown in Iran, they broke the record in length.

They also broke the record in number of protesters that have been massacred. It’s horrifying to think that technology helps enable such crimes.

Why does the Iranian government fear internet access?

In 1988, there was a fatwa where the government massacred a lot of political prisoners in a short span of time. I bring this up because it happened when there was no internet, and the media was heavily controlled and centralized by the state. If you did not flee Iran, and if you were not part of the generation of prisoners and political activists that survived, it was very hard to pass on the memory of that event. Peers of mine in Iran didn’t grow up with the same information. It’s so interesting having these conversations with people and realizing they are learning history only when they leave the country.

What’s been a real game changer is the way you can document and witness these kinds of crimes in the age of the internet. I think it’s obviously a big threat to the regime. It’s a massive threat to them to be able to hold them accountable, and be able to document and witness what they’re doing.

Anytime anyone sees a severe crackdown like an internet shutdown, you know that it’s going to be followed by violence. In 2019 there was a week-long internet shutdown, under the blanket of which they massacred 1,500 people. The reason why is because they don’t want people to use the internet for mobilization and communication, and they don’t want there to be a way to document what’s happening.

Anytime anyone sees a severe crackdown like an internet shutdown, you know that it’s going to be followed by violence

So the denial of the scale of their crimes is part of what they do in Iran, because it’s very hard to assess the percentage of legitimacy that the regime has, because obviously you can’t do free polling. You don’t have free media. Even when you have foreign journalists that go there, they’re followed by minders and the reporting is super-limited. The UN hasn’t been able to really have anyone do proper site visits for human rights documentation, since the start of this regime in 1979.

There isn’t any real access to professional on-the-ground documentation and fact-finding. So it all really depends on the internet, on people, on citizen media. People sending things, putting them online, and then having professional fact-checkers and verification.

What was internet access in Iran like most recently? What platforms and service providers did people use before the blackout started?

Iranians are extremely tech savvy because there’s been a cat-and-mouse game across the internet for most of its existence. Since 2017, 2018, on average, there’s been protests every two years. Each time they have a different level of censorship, new kinds of rules and regulations.

In 2017, [messaging app] Telegram was massive. Some people were even saying Telegram was the internet for Iranians, they were doing everything across Telegram. It worked really well, especially with network bandwidth being really low. So Telegram was a place for news, chatting, socializing everything, even like online markets. But then they blocked it in 2018 when protests started, because protest mobilization on there was a threat to the regime.

There was a move toward Instagram and WhatsApp becoming the most popular applications.

They had yet to be blocked back then. Instagram was more for fun, but it became much more politicized after Telegram was blocked. Then, during the Woman Life Freedom movement in 2022, Instagram and WhatsApp got blocked.

The regime has spent a lot of effort in trying to disable VPNs

Most people are just on VPNs. The regime has spent a lot of effort in trying to disable VPNs. There’s a lot of different VPN projects both for-profit and nonprofit that work within that cat-and-mouse game where protocols are being disabled and new ones are created.

An average Iranian often has many different VPNs. When one can’t work, they’ll turn on another one.

We’ve talked about how technology threatens the regime and how average Iranians use it. Let’s switch over to the other side of this issue: how does technology enable repression?

So there’s various different things the regime does, different levels of enacting information controls. There’s the censorship level of shutting it down.

Then there’s physical coercion. Like, I know people who have not reported their children who have been killed recently because they were so frightened by the process by which they had to get their loved one’s body.

They also flood the information space with a lot of misinformation. They create a lot of doubt.

They’ve been doing this information manipulation even before the internet. Iran is a very complicated information space. There are a lot of actors beyond the regime who also want to manipulate it. Even authentic dissidents and activism will get lumped in with Mossad or CIA operations.

In 1953, the American CIA and British MI6 overthrew the democratic government of Iran, consolidating power under a monarchy that was more favorable to the US and the UK. Many believe that the political instability caused by the CIA and MI6 eventually led to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which established the current authoritarian regime.

From 2014 to 2024, Iran and Russia joined a strategic partnership with the Syrian dictatorship as part of the Syrian civil war. The United States formed its own coalition; both coalitions purported to fight ISIS. The civil war spawned massive amounts of internet disinformation, and in 2018, Facebook and Twitter deleted hundreds of accounts originating in Russia and Iran that formed a global influence network pushing disinformation. The Syrian regime was overthrown at the end of 2024. The next year, following decades of hostilities, Israel and Iran engaged in a 12-day war.

These are some, but not all of the factors that contribute to the complicated information space in Iran that Alimardani is referring to.

The regime’s campaign existed pre-internet, but with technology, it went into overdrive. They’ve been quite clever in some of the ways they’ve covered the protests. They’ve been able to even mobilize, like, people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, against, you know, the Iranian cause for liberation.

There have been a lot of documented efforts of them trying to manipulate protest documentation, undermine it, you know, use the concept of the Liar’s Dividend, which is very easy to use in the increasingly AI world we’re in.

Hold on, can you go through those examples you just mentioned? About mobilizing people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause?

Yeah, so, Iran is quite complicated in that it’s an Islamic fascist state. They use Islam in a lot of ways to repress the people. And there is a lot of very valid rhetoric about Islamophobia in the West, from the very specific context and history of the United States, such as what happened during the War on Terror.

But in Iran, it’s quite different. And this can really be manipulated and conflated, right? Mosques in Iran are often also the headquarters for the Basij [the Iranian paramilitary corps], and people might not know this. So there will be videos like, “Look at these protesters who are setting fire to this mosque. Look at these Islamophobic rioters.”

You might see that, without the context that the mosques also are places where the security forces that kill people are stationed, and lose why something like that would be attacked by Iranians seeking liberation.

You mentioned the regime’s use of AI — do you want to talk a little bit more about that?

Yeah, so, we didn’t need AI for authoritarian regimes to deny evidence of their crimes. Even before AI, Bashir al-Assad [the former dictator of Syria] was saying that reliable documentation of his crimes in Syria were not valid.

Whether we like it or not, AI is being integrated into a lot of things. AI editing is slowly becoming ubiquitous. Like, in fact, we might come to a point where editing photos or anything might become unavoidable without the use of generative AI.

So you no longer have that binary of like, if it’s AI, it’s fake. If there’s no AI, it’s real.

So there’s this very symbolic image that everyone has said reminded them of the Tiananmen Square Tank Man from 1989. But here, a protester is standing in front of armed security forces on motorcycles with weapons. [Ed. note: The New York Post ran with the headline “Powerful image of lone Iranian protester in front of security forces draws parallels to Tiananmen Square ‘Tank Man.’”]

This was a very low resolution video taken from a high rise [building]. Someone had screenshotted a frame from the video and it was quite blurry.

They used some AI editing software to enhance it, and you could see some AI artifacts. Nevertheless, this is an authentic, verified image of a brave protester. Lots of credible sources have verified it. But immediately, it was pointed out to have these AI artifacts, and a lot of the regime accounts started this narrative of “This is all AI slop from Zionists.”

And of course, because, you know, Israel has a special interest in Iran, they have a Farsi-language state account. Israel’s Farsi state account shared the image, which further fueled the claim that this authentic image from Iran was AI slop being pushed by the enemy, Israel.

As you’ve already mentioned, Iran has a complicated information environment. What would you say are the various actors in this space? What kinds of things are they doing?

Obviously there are foreign policy interests by Israel and the US in Iran, just because of the history and very antagonistic relationship they’ve had from the very beginning of the revolution.

The Iran-Israel war in June 2025 was a super interesting moment because the war started a few weeks after Google launched Veo 3, which has made access to very realistic generative AI content very easy. So right off the bat, you could see, from both sides, a lot of AI content coming from the war. This wasn’t the first war where that’s happened — like the Ukraine war has had so many different examples — but since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine [beginning in 2022], the technology has advanced far more, so it became a very big part of the narrative of the situation in Iran.

The most famous example from the Iran-Israel war was a piece of manipulated content that Citizen Lab later was able to attribute to the Israeli state. It was this AI-generated video of Israel bombing the gates of Evin Prison, perpetuating this narrative that they have very precise military operations and that they were freeing these political prisoners.

Evin is a very famous prison for a lot of activists and dissidents and intellectuals in Iran. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called the bombing of Evin Prison a war crime. And indeed, political prisoners were casualties of the bombing.

But that deepfaked video went viral. Mainstream media even reposted it immediately before a lot of various different researchers, including our deepfakes rapid response force and others, were able to attest that indeed this was a manipulated video.

So you have this information space that is quite complicated. But in this scenario, I think it would really be remiss to put that much emphasis on the role that these other actors have. There are things from these outside actors that fog up the information space, but ultimately what’s really happening is that there’s a really unprecedented massacre happening. And the perpetrator is the Islamic Republic of Iran.

I’ve seen some reporting about how Iranians bought Starlink terminals prior to the blackout. Can you say anything about that?

Yeah, I want to start by referencing a really great article by the Sudanese activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied, called “Sudanese People Don’t Have the Luxury of Hating Elon Musk.” Whatever my personal ideas are about Elon Musk, you have to give credit where credit is due. This technology is a game changer. It’s been a game changer in Sudan. And it has been in Iran.

We’ve had a few days of a little bit of connectivity of people coming online just through the ordinary network, but when the shutdown was full and complete, Starlink was really the only window we had into Iran.

When the shutdown was full and complete, Starlink was really the only window we had into Iran

And if you talk to documentation organizations, they’ll tell you, they were getting evidence and doing the verification through what was coming in from the Starlink connections. I know of people who had a Starlink and had like a whole neighborhood of people come in to check in and use the Wi-Fi.

The most credible stats before the situation was that there’s about 50,000 Starlinks. There’s likely more than 56,000 now. It became very popular during the Iran-Israel War, because of course, then the Islamic Republic enacted another shutdown. A lot of people invested in getting Starlink then.

You can get anything you want in Iran through smugglers — I think Starlink was like $1,000 at the time because demand was so high. Receivers are ordinarily a few hundred US dollars. The last price I heard was they were being sold for $2,000 in Iran. It’s a lot of money, but given the demand and the massive risk the smugglers have to undertake, I think it’s fair, but also, it means you can’t really scale this, and the people that have it are very privileged or have access to very privileged people.

What we’re seeing is a very small window. When having discussions with various folks that have been doing firsthand documentation, they’ve expressed, “We’re not getting enough from Kurdistan. We’re not getting enough documentation from Sistan and Baluchestan.” Historically, these areas are often at the forefront of protests, because the regime often has the bloodiest forms of repression in these provinces with marginalized ethnicities. Areas like Sistan and Baluchestan have a lot of economic poverty, so they’d have less access to something privileged like Starlink.

Satellite internet is really this way of reimagining connectivity

For all these years, myself, many people, have been working on this concept of internet censorship and internet shutdowns. And there really hasn’t been a way to reimagine this system. There’s this concept of digital sovereignty in place in terms of internet access and internet infrastructure that fits within national borders. In even the most democratic of countries, this is still national infrastructure that the government can have access or forms of control over.

This concept has to be broken. Satellite internet is really this way of reimagining connectivity, not just for Iran, but anywhere where lack of connectivity results in a crisis, whether humanitarian one, or a massacre of this proportion.

It’s really important to reconceive access to satellite internet in a way that could scale beyond those who are privileged and beyond those willing to take the risk. And one of the ideas that I’ve had and have been working on with other colleagues at Access Now has been to push for direct-to-cell access, which is a form of satellite internet connectivity that depends on technology that exists in phones created from 2020 onwards. We launched this campaign called Direct 2 Cell, hoping to push forward this concept.

On a personal note, how are you doing? Have you heard from your friends, family, other people you know in Iran recently?

I’ve been able to be in touch with some of my family and others here and there.

I also had that random FaceTime audio call from another person I know. I was very worried about them because they’ve been at the protests. I had heard through various others that they were okay, but I finally heard from them firsthand, and it was such a bizarre experience, speaking to them.

I had never heard them sound the way that they sounded: recounting their experience of leaving the protest before the military tanks came to open fire on the crowds, how they got tear gassed, and for the next few days, seeing water hoses washing blood off the streets. It sounded like they were making a lot of dark jokes — I had never heard them sound this way. I don’t know how you can walk the streets of your neighborhood, seeing people wash off blood, and just…. like, something not fundamentally change in your mind.

I just, I don’t, I can’t imagine how to process it if I was there. As someone in the diaspora, it’s hard to process being privileged and being away.

Before it turned into an ‘80s-inspired pop project, the band had more in common with Mogwai.

New York City got hit with a hell of a snowstorm last week. And, inevitably, when I’m watching the snow fall, wandering the oddly quiet streets after dark, people hiding inside and staying warm, I put on M83’s sophomore record, Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts.

Before Nicolas Fromageau left the band and Anthony Gonzalez embraced traditional pop song structures, saxophone solos, and teen angst, M83 released two albums of mostly instrumental music. The self-titled debut album is kind of forgettable, but the second one finds the French duo taking inspiration from the repetitive bombast of Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Dead Cities is a decidedly French twist on post-rock grandeur, building blankets of sound from drum machines, analog synths, and heavily compressed guitar.

There’s a sense of liminality to Dead Cities, an uncanny atmosphere that lives up to its name. Listening to the gently repeating melody of “Be Wild” as the track slowly accumulates layers, it’s impossible not to imagine walking through a once bustling city that now lies freshly abandoned. “America” captures the panic of The Twilight Zone’s “Where Is Everybody?” as frantic drums, My Bloody Valentine-esque guitar, and uneasy synths build to an early crescendo.

You can tell something is wrong from moment one, though. The record opens with “Birds,” a 54-second chant:

The computerized voice is initially bathed in digital distortion, slowly resolving into a soothing tone that inherently feels untrustworthy. There is no sun. There are no birds. And there are no flowers. The album opens by lying to you before launching into highlight “Unrecorded.”

“Unrecorded” feels like the mission statement for the record. Analog arpeggios, driving drums, droney guitars, manipulated vocals, and cinematic synth strings all combine in a wall of snow-bound sound. Listening to tracks like this, it’s shocking that another 10 years for Hollywood to enlist M83 to score a film (2013’s Oblivion).

M83 would eventually go on to record shoegaze-indebted retro pop, scoring hits like “Kim & Jessie” and the absolutely inescapable “Midnight City.” But before that, the group explored something more cinematic and open-ended.

Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts is available on Bandcamp and most streaming platforms, including Apple Music, YouTube Music, Qobuz, Deezer, and Spotify.

With buttons instead of a touchscreen, the Xteink X4 can be a challenge to use, but a growing community is fixing that.

I’ve used and reviewed dozens of e-readers over the years, but the 5-inch Kobo Mini remains my favorite for one simple reason: It was small. While it lacked useful features like screen lighting and page turn buttons, its size made it an e-reader I actually wanted to carry every day. The $69 Xteink X4 e-reader is even smaller than the Kobo Mini and E Ink smartphones like Boox Palma. It’s satisfyingly pocketable but also frustratingly unintuitive and functionally limited out of the box. That could be a deal-breaker were it not for a growing community of users working to improve it.

Like the Kodak Charmera, I was pleasantly surprised at how small the X4 is in person. Its 4.3-inch E Ink screen is only a bit tinier than the Kobo Mini’s 5-inch panel, but the X4’s bezels are much slimmer, making the e-reader feel significantly smaller. The joy of nerding out over the X4’s size was quickly cut short when I tested one of its most compelling features.

When the X4 was announced last December, Xteink shared photos of the e-reader stuck to the back of an iPhone using its MagSafe feature. It made the X4 seem like a better alternative to e-reader cases for those wanting a second screen on their phones, but the odd position of its magnets makes it impossible to stick the e-reader to the back of my iPhone 16 Pro in any usable way.

It’s an issue that many X4 users have complained about, and in a statement emailed to The Verge, the company explains that “during our early development and testing phase, we worked with a limited range of iPhone models. As a result, on some newer models, the magnetic alignment may not appear perfectly centered.” As a work-around, Xteink includes a pair of magnetic adhesive rings that can be stuck to devices to allow for proper alignment.

However, the X4 also extends past the bottom of my iPhone, so instead of trying to awkwardly use the two together, I’ve been using it as a standalone ultra-compact e-reader. At less than 6mm thick, the X4 takes up very little room in the sling bag I carry every day and is protected using a basic magnetic folio-style case that’s included.

The Xteink X4 is one of the cheapest e-readers on the market, but that price comes with some challenges and compromises, including a 4.3-inch E Ink screen with a 220ppi resolution. That’s less than the 300ppi e-paper screens on the latest Kindle and Kobo e-readers. You’ll see jagged edges on fine text if you look hard enough, but it’s enough resolution for a pleasant reading experience.

There’s also no screen lighting, so if you’re planning to read before bed, you’ll need a lamp or a flashlight. The lack of a touchscreen is more frustrating. The X4 features several buttons on its right edge and below its display. They’re not labeled, and their functionality varies depending on where you are in the UI.

Further complicating matters, three of the buttons are two-sided and do different things depending on which side you press. It’s frustrating to try and remember which side of which button you need to press to make a selection, jump back to a previous screen, or simply navigate a list of options. And it’s not helped by the X4’s limited and confusing software.

While Boox’s smartphone-size E Ink Palma devices run Android and let you do everything from watching videos to playing games, the X4 is solely focused on reading, with support limited to TXT and EPUB files, plus images like JPGs and BMPs, which I had limited success loading. There’s no built-in bookstore so you’ll need to source your own DRM-free EPUB files. That’s a little easier now, thanks to Amazon recently expanding support for EPUBs, but just getting ebooks onto the X4 feels harder than it could be.

The e-reader doesn’t mount as a storage device when connected to a computer, and while you’re supposed to be able to wirelessly upload files from a browser over Wi-Fi or your phone, I didn’t have much success in getting that to work. The easiest way is to copy files to a memory card using a USB reader, but that is needlessly complicated by the X4’s microSD card slot that makes inserting and ejecting a memory card difficult without long nails or a paper clip.

Reading ebooks is an okay experience, and I’m always a fan of dedicated page turn buttons. But if you’re familiar with a Kobo or Kindle, you’ll find yourself sorely missing options for adjusting text formatting. You only get two font-size choices, three line spacing options, and no way to increase the margins around text. Images and illustrations in ebooks are simply not displayed, most text formatting is ignored, and while you’re supposed to be able to load and use your own font files, it’s another finicky feature I had no success with.

You can jump to different chapters, pages, and bookmarks, or turn on features like auto page turns at set intervals, but doing so requires opening and navigating a series of menus using the X4’s buttons. It feels unnecessarily complicated. It’s an experience you’ll eventually get marginally comfortable with, but not one you’ll ever enjoy.

Xteink has already released several software updates improving the X4’s UI and usability. Progress has been slow, but because the company hasn’t locked down the e-reader, a growing community has taken it upon itself to improve the X4. Installing CrossPoint Reader on the X4, an open-source alternative firmware, was a simple process that immediately solved many of the pain points of Xteink’s software. CrossPoint simplifies the X4’s UI, expands the options for how ebooks look, and adds onscreen labels for what each button does. It’s also easy to uninstall, but I don’t think I’m ever going to.

The X4 will never replace the Kobo Libra 2 I use for most of my reading. A touchscreen, lighting, access to a robust ebook store, and a UI that doesn’t have me pulling my hair out are features I can’t do without. But over the past few weeks, I haven’t left the house without the tiny X4. It’s a welcome alternative to my phone (that always seems full of bad news) if I have a few minutes to while away, despite its frustrations. I don’t like recommending devices that require third-party upgrades to be “fixed,” but the work being done by the X4 community makes the e-reader worth considering if pocketability — and a little tinkering — is your priority.

            <div id="article-text">How much does a human touch matter when it comes to a latte? It depends.

In Seattle, the only thing we love more than coffee is our coffee shops.

On a six-block walk I pass at least a half dozen, each with their own vibe: one focused on chai, another inside a yoga studio, a Starbucks that’s surprisingly busy for late afternoon downtown. I passed them all up to get to one shop in particular, where a barista named Jarvis would address me by name and make me a thoroughly decent latte with rose-flavored syrup — nothing out of the ordinary in Seattle. But Jarvis, unlike the other baristas keeping the city’s many shops humming, is a robot.

Hill7 is a luxury apartment building located between the courthouse, the convention center, and a bunch of surface streets that function as an extended I-5 on-ramp. It’s at the center of it all, and also nowhere in particular. To get there, I walk past vacant storefronts with graffitied signs advertising prime retail space, and also an Amazon Go store that looked deserted from the outside. Amazon would announce its imminent closure the next day.

The robot barista resides in a large stand in the Hill7 lobby, sharing space with a place that sells sushi by the pound. There’s a not-unpleasant soy sauce and seaweed smell in the air as I place my order on an iPad. Jarvis isn’t a full humanoid robot, nor is it a glorified vending machine. Jarvis is a robotic arm made by a Seattle-based company called Artly, and is positioned within reach of a customized La Marzocco espresso machine. It “talks” over a loudspeaker, directing customers to order on the tablet and complimenting their choice of beverage when they do.

For the most part, it does all the things human baristas do — grabbing a cup, moving the portafilter from the espresso machine to the grinder and back again, pouring latte art. It doesn’t have to go as far as pressing buttons or pulling levers to start grinding beans or brewing the espresso thanks to some behind-the-scenes automation, but as it makes my drink, it goes through a lot of motions I’m quite familiar with.

I was horrified to learn that the company wanted me to actually talk to the customers while I made their coffee

I got my first barista job during college, and during training I was horrified to learn that the company wanted me to actually talk to the customers while I made their coffee. Not only did I have to learn a new set of skills and memorize a bunch of drink recipes, I had to swallow my social anxiety and make small talk with people who didn’t really want to be talking to me? An actual nightmare. But I tried anyway, and at times I had to focus so hard on the social aspect that I completely screwed up the coffee bit. I still think about the new dad who came in and carefully specified decaf for his order — I got so caught up in making small talk that I gave him a beverage with three fully caffeinated shots of espresso.

Later I did a stint at an artisanal gelato shop where the owner took deep pride in running a serious coffee program and didn’t mandate small talk. I learned how to dial in espresso, how to make a pour-over (not nearly as simple as the name implies). I was also in the messiest part of my 20s, going through my first breakup and in a not-unrelated incident, showing up to work so hungover that the owner took me aside, visibly worried, and asked if I was okay. He thought I was having some kind of breakdown; I told him I just got too drunk the night before.

Jarvis, on the other hand, has never shown up hungover, or late, or sweating from the six-block walk to get to work. Jarvis stays right where it is when the shop closes at 3PM. I also paid a visit to Artly’s location near Pike Place Market, where Jarvis is flanked by two other robotic arms: Amanda and Ponyo. At both locations, the robot baristas are overseen by a human. In one instance, the human assistant had to refill a tank of milk when it ran empty while making my drink. They also wiped up some drops of spilled milk on the counter in front of Jarvis. But mostly, the human Artly employee seems to sit alone scrolling on their phone while the robots repeat a greeting message on loop, despite a lack of customers.

I’d met Jarvis before. Weeks earlier at CES, I was in a line at the Las Vegas Convention Center Starbucks that looked to be about 40 minutes long. I typed the word “coffee” in the CES app vendor search, and wouldn’t you know, Artly had a booth just a short walk away. I envisioned a machine churning out mediocre coffee with silly custom latte art. I was, to be quite honest, sure I would not like it. I was wrong.

Jarvis, so Artly says, is trained on the movements of a specific human barista: Joe Yang, head of Artly’s coffee program and a US Coffee Championship winner in 2023. It mimics his movements as it makes each drink, which takes about three minutes according to the company (and confirmed by my own experience). Jarvis uses AI to make adjustments as needed on the fly, narrating aloud things like “there are no grounds in the portafilter” when it encounters something unexpected. The drinks it has made for me — a cappuccino at CES, the aforementioned rose latte, and a plain latte — have been good to very good. Certainly better than I expected from a nonhuman barista, and honestly better than the kind of drink I would typically get from a human-operated cafe that serves but doesn’t specialize in espresso drinks.

Jarvis, Joe Yang, and hundreds of human baristas across Seattle have all mastered one particularly crucial task in making an espresso drink: steaming milk properly. To make a great latte or cappuccino, you first need to create tiny bubbles by bringing the steam wand just barely above the surface of the milk, and then let the steam create a vortex in the milk pitcher to mix this “micro foam” into a unified texture. Milk that has been properly steamed looks like wet paint. You can’t replicate it by heating the milk and then whipping it around with a frothing tool. You’ll know you’re in for a bad latte if you hear the steam wand screaming against the sides of a milk pitcher, a sure sign that no texture is being created. Proper steaming is as quiet as a whisper.

I made a lot of bad lattes before I learned the right way; it certainly wasn’t part of the training at my corporate coffee gig. But that was mostly beside the point at a shop where most people either wanted some variation on a mocha or a drip coffee, black, as fast as they could get it. The espresso machines at that job did most of the work for us, too. All I really had to do was keep the bean hopper topped up and push the right button to pull a double shot of espresso.

My old boss at the gelato shop mentioned once that staffing was the hardest part of his job as a small business owner. Hiring, training, managing schedules, inevitably training new workers as people left. That job was the most physically demanding I’d ever had, and truthfully I wasn’t a very good employee. But watching the owner work seven days a week year-round, covering shifts when one of us called off unexpectedly, watching his investment go down the drain in a very literal sense when I mindlessly started rinsing out a pan of freshly prepared sorbetto (a real thing that happened!) — I understood what he meant. People are hard.

Giant corporations seem to agree. Starbucks headquarters is about 3 miles south of Artly’s Hill7 shop. I used to bike there often to visit the Reserve Roastery located on the first floor, which was welcoming and always busy. The Reserve was Starbucks’ best impression of a fancy third-wave coffee shop, with a more focused menu and a real sit-down-and-stay vibe, and I never got a bad latte there.

Starbucks abruptly shuttered it last fall, identifying it vaguely as one of many closed or soon-to-be-closed stores where the company was “unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don’t see a path to financial performance.” The barista workforce at that Reserve and one across town in Capitol Hill happened to be unionized; the company denies this had any influence on its decision to close the stores.

My barista career ended decades ago, but it still feels like a core part of my identity as a worker, and maybe even as a human. Sure, I learned how to make a damn good latte, but I also learned discipline — not to mention the consequences you face in its absence. I learned how to make small talk even when I just wanted to keep my head down. I learned how terrible it feels to come to work after getting wasted the night before, and never did it again. I learned how to screw up, badly, and pick up and keep going because people are depending on you. I wasn’t the ideal employee; I was human.

My most pessimistic view on Jarvis is as a neat replacement for the human tendency to be human. Robot baristas don’t make the wrong drink. They don’t need breaks. They don’t unionize. They’re predictable, reliable, and honestly, capable of making a better latte than I made in my button-pushing corporate coffee job. They’d be easier to manage in a hundred different ways. But can you even really call a robot coffee shop a coffee shop?

Artly has deployed its robot barista in a few places outside of Seattle, and it seems to be enjoying mixed results. There’s a location at Pier 39 in a touristy part of San Francisco, but a couple of other Bay Area-adjacent shopping mall locations listed on the company website appear as “permanently closed” on Google Maps; both are close to other, human-led options. And I should note that my experiences might not be typical of any Artly visit. While the drinks I had were better than average, they were also near company headquarters, or in the case of the CES visit, under the direct supervision of the company’s leadership. Not everyone has glowing things to say about the coffee quality. Even robots have a hard time meeting a high quality bar consistently, it seems.

I’m encouraged by the fact that Artly doesn’t really position Jarvis as a replacement for human barista jobs where they already exist. Right now, you can buy a coffee from one of their robots at Muji stores in the US and Canada. Notably, Muji didn’t employ any baristas before it got the robots. The company also lists Tesla’s Fremont factory as a partner location. As a job perk, especially somewhere less densely populated by fancy coffee shops than downtown Seattle, a robot barista doesn’t seem like a bad idea at all.

As an addition to an airport lounge, or maybe operating at a train station long after human workers have all gone home for the night, I think a robot barista makes total sense. Can you make a viable business out of those scenarios? I’m less sure. On both of my recent visits to Artly’s shops, I didn’t see anyone else come in and order a drink. Maybe both places are busier in the morning as people head to work, or during the summer when literal boatloads of tourists visit downtown. But especially around the Pike Place Market location, many of the coffee shops in the neighborhood look just as busy as ever.

If a coffee shop is just a place to walk in, place an order, and walk out with a coffee better than the one you can make at home, then Artly does the job. Depending on the hour and the day, sometimes that’s all I need a coffee shop to be. But more often than that, a coffee shop is a destination. It’s a place to go when I want to get out of the house. A physical manifestation of community. The coffee is usually excellent — shoutout once again to Seattle coffee culture — but even when it’s less than perfect, it offers humanity. And no robot can replicate that.

Antigravity’s ambitious A1 360-degree drone is 15 percent off through February 9th. The first-ever discount on this model is available across all bundles, with the most affordable option dropping from $1,599 to $1,359 at Amazon and Best Buy. Pricier bundles are also discounted and include accessories such as a carrying case, additional replaceable drone wings, and extra batteries.

The Antigravity A1, Insta360’s first drone, really impressed us during our hands-on with a prototype in December 2025. It can shoot in 8K at 30 frames per second or in 5.7K at 60 frames per second. It comes with a remote control, and you can get a cockpit view with the included Vision Goggles. They provide a 360-degree first-person view even as the drone flies straight, letting you see things you might have otherwise missed. There’s a screen on the outside of the goggles that lets people see what you’re seeing through the A1’s eyes.

This sale coincides with the launch of a new Flight Simulator feature that Antigravity launched on January 29th. It lets you practice flights via the Vision Goggles without actually having to fly the A1 drone. The company says that the feature creates a virtual flying environment that replicates how the A1 handles, helping those concerned about crashing become more comfortable with the controls.

            <div id="article-text">Phone manufacturers are throwing everything they have at long-distance lenses in order to stand out.

This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on Android phones, follow Dominic Preston. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Ultra wasn’t the first phone to feature a periscopic telephoto lens — both Huawei and Oppo beat the Korean company to it — but it was the first in the US to make such a big deal about it. Almost all of Samsung’s marketing for the S20 Ultra centered on its so-called Space Zoom, its 5x optical folded periscope lens, capable of digitally zooming much further. Samsung even wrote “Space Zoom 100x” on the back of the phone itself, just in case you forgot.

That phone sparked a strong reaction from some. Many questioned why you’d ever need a camera that zoomed so far you could look inside the top windows of a skyscraper; some suggested it would only ever be used by perverts and voyeurs; others simply pointed out that almost every photo taken at 100x zoom sucked. Samsung and its competitors learned from some of that criticism and mostly stopped talking about 100x zoom, focusing on better quality shots from shorter distances in future marketing material.

What manufacturers didn’t stop was competing on telephoto cameras in the first place. Apple introduced its first iPhone with a 3x telephoto, the 13 Pro, in 2021 (though wouldn’t get a true periscope until another two years later). That same year, Google added a 48-megapixel, 4x periscopic telephoto to its Pixel 6 Pro, while Samsung jumped to a 10x telephoto on its S21 Ultra, a feat Huawei had already achieved a year earlier. Along with the longer zooms, companies began to add larger sensors, faster apertures, and more pixels in an effort to win the arms race.

Cameras have long been a source of fierce competition between smartphone manufacturers and for good reason: a 2023 YouGov survey found that more than half of US flagship phone buyers see photo quality as an important factor when picking a phone, with battery life the only feature to be ranked significantly more important. They’ve only become more important as other specs have become more homogenous. Almost every Android phone now offers a chipset from one of two manufacturers, similar RAM and storage specs, and a 120Hz OLED display somewhere between six and seven inches in size. Cameras offer room to be different, from outlandish lens module designs to high resolution sensors, with meaningful variation in photo quality, color science, and exposure.

Telephoto cameras have become a particular focus for the simple reason that most main cameras have gotten too good. An affordable Android handset will now take excellent photos in almost any lighting — even low light, once the ground for fierce OEM rivalries, is now essentially a solved problem. Selfie and ultrawide cameras are similarly capable, while typically attracting a lot less interest in the finer details of their photo quality. But people still associate telephotos with grainy images of far-off buildings, leaving plenty of room for manufacturers to find improvements and make their mark.

Phone manufacturers are now turning to more and more extravagant hardware setups in order to gain an advantage.

Vivo has chased higher resolutions, introducing a 200-megapixel telephoto in its X100 Ultra, since adopted by Honor, Xiaomi, and more. Samsung is one of several brands to include two telephoto lenses on a single phone, each offering a different zoom. Sony tried to one-up the competition with continuous optical zoom on its Xperia 1 IV. Xiaomi just resurrected that idea for its 17 Ultra, going a step further by introducing a rotatable zoom ring on the camera island. Last year’s Huawei Pura 80 Ultra put two telephoto lenses on top of a single sensor, with a movable prism to direct the light from the appropriate lens, allowing space for a larger sensor than other phones.

The latest wave of competition has stepped beyond the phone itself. Vivo was first to offer a telephoto extender for its X200 Ultra, an add-on lens that mounts onto the phone with the help of a special case, producing 8.7x optical zoom from a lens the length of a Coke can. Predictably enough, others followed suit, with Oppo and Honor among the companies offering near-identical extender lenses — though a handful of third-party manufacturers have offered similar add-on lenses for years.

Increasingly, manufacturers have taken to heart that longer isn’t always better. Recent Ultra flagships from Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi have dropped back to shorter 3-4x optical zooms, distances that make them practical choices for portrait photos and product shots. Larger sensors and faster apertures mean they capture more light than older telephotos, perform better at night, and produce natural bokeh without a dedicated portrait mode. When I’m using one of these phones, I now find myself shooting the overwhelming majority of photos using the telephoto cameras, which tend to offer more attractive framing and depth to shots than the flat, wide main cameras. Telephotos aren’t only better than ever — they’re increasingly the best cameras on a phone, period.

For now, expect the arms race to continue. We’ll likely see imitators of Xiaomi’s updated take on continuous zoom and Huawei’s alternating lenses, while more traditional telephotos keep getting bigger sensors and wider apertures. There’ll be more add-on lenses, likely getting longer, larger, and probably with their own continuous zoom capabilities too.

One obvious growth area is AI zoom. Smartphones have used machine learning to enhance digital zoom for years, but we’re now seeing generative AI applied for the same effect, most notably in the Pixel 10 series’ Pro Res Zoom. It raises the usual questions around what a photo actually is, with Google smartly disabling the feature when faces are in frame, heading some problems off at the pass. Still, with the RAM crisis driving costs up across the board, expect manufacturers to jump at new ways to enhance photos with software, rather than ever more expensive hardware components.

Low light photos are still one area where many telephotos can’t compete with main cameras. Sensors and apertures are smaller, and stabilization is trickier for the delicate periscopic setups, making it harder to get results when the light gets low. Serious improvement has been made in the last year or two though, and I expect it to continue.

After that, all bets are off. We’re getting close to the point of diminishing returns on telephoto lenses, at least outside of the 100x zoom photos that few photographers ever actually take. Component costs mean Ultra phone telephotos still have a real edge over those in regular flagships or cheaper phones, but the moment that changes, manufacturers will have to find a new race to run.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131945/inside-the-marketplace-powering-bespoke-ai-deepfakes-of-real-women/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.)

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

Therapists are secretly using ChatGPT. Clients are triggered.Declan would never have found out his therapist was using ChatGPT had it not been for a technical mishap. The connection was patchy during one of their online sessions, so Declan suggested they turn off their video feeds. Instead, his therapist began inadvertently sharing his screen.For the rest of the session, Declan was privy to a real-time stream of ChatGPT analysis rippling across his therapist’s screen, who was taking what Declan was saying, putting it into ChatGPT, and then parroting its answers.But Declan is not alone. In fact, a growing number of people are reporting receiving AI-generated communiqués from their therapists. Clients’ trust and privacy are being abandoned in the process. Read the full story.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

What AI “remembers” about you is privacy’s next frontier

—Miranda Bogen, director of the AI Governance Lab at the Center for Democracy & Technology, & Ruchika Joshi, fellow at the Center for Democracy & Technology specializing in AI safety and governance

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">G2 has completed a major acquisition by purchasing three of the world’s most influential software discovery platforms from Gartner. The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.

This week signals consolidation and sovereignty: G2 reshapes software discovery, Slush enters a new leadership phase, and Europe doubles down on digital independence.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.
