            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tencia Benavidez, a Supernatural user who lives in New Mexico, started her VR workouts during the Covid pandemic. She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches.

“They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There’s just something really special about those coaches.”

Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commission tried to block Meta from purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.

“Meta fought the government to buy this thing,” Benavidez says. “All that just for them to shut it down? What was the point?”

I reached out to Meta and Supernatural, and neither responded to my requests for comment.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Meta has laid off more than 1,000 people across its VR and metaverse efforts. The move comes after years of the company hemorrhaging billions of dollars on its metaverse products. In addition to laying off most of the staff at Supernatural, Meta has shut down three internal VR studios that made games like Resident Evil 4 and Deadpool VR.

“If it was a bottom-line thing, I think they could have charged more money,” Goff Johnson says about Supernatural. “I think people would have paid for it. This just seems unnecessarily heartless.”

There is a split in the community about who will stay and continue to pay the subscription fee and who will leave. Supernatural has more than 3,000 lessons available in the service, so while new content won’t be added, some feel there is plenty of content left in the library. Other users worry about how Supernatural will continue to license music from big-name bands.

“Supernatural is amazing, but I am canceling it because of this,” Chip told me. “The library is large, so there’s enough to keep you busy, but not for the same price.”

There are other VR workout experiences like FitXR or even the VR staple Beat Saber, which Supernatural cribs a lot of design concepts from. Still, they don’t hit the same bar for many of the Supernatural faithful.

“I’m going to stick it out until they turn the lights out on us,” says Stefanie Wong, a Bay Area accountant who has used Supernatural since shortly after the pandemic and has organized and attended meetup events. “It’s not the app. It’s the community, and it’s the coaches that we really, really care about.”

I tried out Supernatural’s Together feature on Wednesday, the day after the layoffs. It’s where I met Chip and Alisa. When we could stop to catch our breath, we talked about the changes coming to the service. They had played through previous sessions hosted by Jane Fonda or playlists with a mix of music that would change regularly. This one was an artist series featuring entirely Imagine Dragons songs.

In the session, as we punched blocks while being serenaded by this shirtless dude crooning, recorded narrations from Supernatural coach Dwana Olsen chimed in to hype us up.

“Take advantage of these moments,” Olsen said as we punched away. “Use these movements to remind you of how much awesome life you have yet to live.”

Frankly, it was downright invigorating. And bittersweet. We ended another round, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Chip, Alisa, and I high-fived like crazy and readied for another round.

“Beautiful,” Alisa said. “It’s just beautiful, isn’t it?”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/managers-on-alert-for-launch-fever-as-pressure-builds-for-nasas-moon-mission/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida’s Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.

Riding atop one of NASA’s diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world’s heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.

The rollout marks a major step for NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.

The flight will culminate with a scorching 25,000 mph (40,000 km per hour) reentry over the Pacific Ocean. The four Artemis II astronauts—NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen—will become the fastest humans in history, edging out a speed record set during the Apollo era of lunar exploration.

The journey for the fully-assembled Moon rocket will begin early Saturday at a slower pace. After leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building, the moving 11 million-pound structure will head east, then make a left turn before climbing the ramp to Pad 39B overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

“We will be at a cruising speed of under one mile per hour,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s launch director for the Artemis II mission. “It’ll be a little slower around the turns and up the hill.”

The crawler carrying the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft was built 60 years ago to haul NASA’s Saturn V rockets, then kept around for the Space Shuttle Program. Now, the vehicle is back to its original purpose of positioning Moon-bound rockets on their launch pads.

“These are the kinds of days that we live for when you do the kind of work that we do,” said John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Mission Management Team for the Artemis II mission. “The rocket and the spacecraft, Orion Integrity, are getting ready to roll to the pad … It really doesn’t get much better than this, and we’re making history.”

You can watch live views of the rollout in this YouTube stream provided by NASA.

Artemis II is the first crew flight of NASA’s Artemis program, an initiative named for the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. NASA named the program Artemis in 2019, but some of the building blocks have been around for 20 years.

NASA selected Orion contractor Lockheed Martin to oversee the development of a deep space capsule in 2006 as part of the George W. Bush administration’s soon-to-be canceled Constellation program. In 2011, a political bargain between the Obama administration and Congress revived the Orion program and kicked off development of the Space Launch System. The announcement of the Artemis program in 2019 leaned on work already underway on Orion and the SLS rocket as the centerpieces of an architecture to return US astronauts to the Moon.

Tens of billions of dollars later, everything is finally coming together for the final all-important milestone in developing the vehicles for transporting crews between the Earth and the Moon. A human-rated lunar lander and spacesuits tailored for Moonwalking astronauts are still a few years away from readiness. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin for landers, and with Axiom Space for suits.

A successful Artemis II mission would demonstrate to NASA’s managers and engineers that the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket fulfill their roles in the Artemis architecture. NASA is expected to rely on the SLS rocket, which costs more than $2 billion per flight and is expendable by design, for several more missions until commercial alternatives are available.

America’s return to the Moon now has a geopolitical imperative. China is working to land its own astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and US officials want to beat the Chinese to the Moon for the motivation of national prestige and the material benefits of accessing lunar resources, among other reasons. For now, budget-writing lawmakers in Congress and President Donald Trump’s new NASA chief, Jared Isaacman, agree the existing SLS/Orion architecture, despite its cost and shortcomings, offers the surest opportunity to beat the Chinese space program to a crew lunar landing.

Then, if all goes according to plan, NASA can turn to cheaper (and in one case, more capable) rockets to help the government afford the expenditure required to construct a Moon base.

“Putting crew on the rocket and taking the crew around the Moon, this is going be our first step toward a sustained lunar presence,” Honeycutt said. “It’s 10 days [and] four astronauts going farther from Earth than any other human has ever traveled. We’ll be validating the Orion spacecraft’s life support, navigation and crew systems in the really harsh environments of deep space, and that’s going to pave the way for future landings.”

There is still much work ahead before NASA can clear Artemis II for launch. At the launch pad, technicians will complete final checkouts and closeouts before NASA’s launch team gathers in early February for a critical practice countdown. During this countdown, called a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), Blackwell-Thompson and her team will oversee the loading of the SLS rocket’s core stage and upper stage with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.

The cryogenic fluids, particularly liquid hydrogen, gave fits to the Artemis launch team as NASA prepared to launch the Artemis I mission—without astronauts—on the SLS rocket’s first test flight in 2022. Engineers resolved the issues and successfully launched the Artemis I mission in November 2022, and officials will apply the lessons for the Artemis II countdown.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “And the things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to do for the Artemis II vehicle.”

Assuming the countdown rehearsal goes according to plan, NASA could be in a position to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as February 6. But the schedule for February 6 is tight, with no margin for error. Officials typically have about five days per month when they can launch Artemis II, when the Moon is in the right position relative to Earth, and the Orion spacecraft can follow the proper trajectory toward reentry and splashdown to limit stress on the capsule’s heat shield.

In February, the available launch dates are February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, with launch windows in the overnight hours in Florida. If the mission isn’t off the ground by February 11, NASA will have to stand down until a new series of launch opportunities beginning March 6. The space agency has posted a document showing all available launch dates and times through the end of April.

NASA’s leaders are eager for Artemis II to fly. NASA is not only racing China, a reality the agency’s former administrator acknowledged during the Biden administration. Now, the Trump administration is pushing NASA to accomplish a human landing on the Moon by the end of his presidential term on January 20, 2029.

One of Honeycutt’s jobs as chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) is ensuring all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed amid the frenzy of final launch preparations. While the hardware for Artemis II is on the move in Florida, the astronauts and flight controllers are wrapping up their final training and simulations at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

“I think I’ve got a good eye for launch fever,” he said Friday.

“As chair of the MMT, I’ve got one job, and it’s the safe return of Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy. I consider that a duty and a trust, and it’s one I intend to see through.”</div>

            <h2>Rackspace customers grapple with “devastating” email hosting price hike</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rackspace’s new pricing for its email hosting services is “devastating,” according to a partner that has been using Rackspace as its email provider since 1999.

In recent weeks, Rackspace updated its email hosting pricing. Its standard plan is now $10 per mailbox per month. Businesses can also pay for the Rackspace Email Plus add-on for an extra $2/mailbox/month (for “file storage, mobile sync, Office-compatible apps, and messaging”), and the Archiving add-on for an extra $6/mailbox/month (for unlimited storage).

As recently as November 2025, Rackspace charged $3/mailbox/month for its Standard plan, and an extra $1/mailbox/month for the Email Plus add-on, and an additional $3/mailbox/month for the Archival add-on, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.

Rackspace’s reseller partners have been especially vocal about the impacts of the new pricing.

In a blog post on Thursday, web hosting service provider and Rackspace reseller Laughing Squid said Rackspace is “increasing our email pricing by an astronomical 706 percent, with only a month-and-a half’s notice.”

Laughing Squid founder Scott Beale told Ars Technica that he received the “devastating” news via email on Wednesday. The last time Rackspace increased Laughing Squid’s email prices was by 55 percent in 2019, he said.

“The price increase has a major impact on the ability to make money due to the fact that email is now our largest expense, and we were only given a month-and-a-half notice,” Beale told Ars.

Online, there are reports of Rackspace partners being quoted email pricing increases of 110 percent to nearly 500 percent. The reports say that the new, higher-per-mailbox quotes don’t include volume pricing discounts. Beale noted that Laughing Squid’s quote doesn’t include discounts that the company previously received.

“We had really good reseller pricing that we negotiated with Rackspace due to the number of mailboxes we had with them and how long we had been a customer. All of that seemed to vanish when they notified us of their new pricing,” he said.

Ars contacted Rackspace asking about the 706 percent price hike that Laughing Squid says it’s facing, why Rackspace decided to increase its prices now, and why it didn’t give its partners more advanced notice. A company spokesperson responded, saying:

Rackspace Email is a reliable and secure business-class email solution for small businesses. To continue delivering the service levels our customers expect, effective March 2026, Rackspace Technology is increasing the price of Rackspace Email. We have a support team available to help our customers to discuss their options.

The spokesperson added that Rackspace’s “mission is to deliver quality, trusted and reliable hosted email solution for businesses.”

Despite Rackspace’s stated commitment to email hosting, the prohibitive pricing seems like a deterrent for a business being viewed as high-effort and low-margin. Email has grown complex over the years, requiring time and expertise for proper management at scale. It’s become simpler, or more lucrative, for some cloud companies to focus on selling their managed services on top of offerings like Microsoft 365—as Rackspace does—or Google Workspace and let the larger companies behind those solutions deal with infrastructure costs and complexities.

Rackspace’s price hike also comes as an AI-driven RAM shortage is impacting the availability and affordability of other computing components, including storage.

With Rackspace, which went public in 2020, also having quit hosting Microsoft Exchange following a costly 2022 ransomware attack, the Texas-headquartered company may be looking to minimize its email hosting duties as much as possible.

Meanwhile, Laughing Squid is increasing prices for Rackspace mailboxes and offering services with a different email provider, PolarisMail, to customers at lower prices. Beale said he has reached out to Rackspace about the new pricing but hasn’t heard back yet.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.

Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.

Most cogs would have been about 15 to 25 meters long and 5 to 8 meters wide, capable of carrying about 200 tons of cargo—big, impressive ships for their time. But Svaelget 2, an absolute unit of a ship, measured about 28 meters from bow to stern, 9 meters wide, and could have carried about 300 tons. Its size alone was a surprise to the archaeologists.

“We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme,” said archaeologist Otto Uldum of Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum, who led the excavation, in a press release.

Medieval Europe’s merchant class was growing in both size and wealth in the early 1400s, and the cog was both a product of that growth and the engine driving it. The mere fact of its existence points to a society that could afford to invest in building big, expensive trading ships (and could confidently expect a return on that investment). And physically, it’s a product of the same trading networks it supplied: while the heavy timbers of its frame were cut locally in the Netherlands, the Pomeranian oak planks of Svaelget 2’s hull came from Poland.

“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” said Uldum. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”

For about 600 years, layers of sand had protected the starboard (right, for you landlubbers) side of the wreck from erosion and decay. Nautical archaeologists usually find only the very bottoms of cogs; the upper structures of the ship—rigging, decks, and castles—quickly decay in the ocean. That means that some of the most innovative parts of the ships’ construction appear only in medieval drawings and descriptions.

But Svaelget 2 offers archaeologists a hands-on look at the real deal, from rigging to the ship’s galley and the stern castle: a tall wooden structure at the back of the ship, where crew and passengers could have sought at least a little shelter from the elements. Medieval drawings and texts describe cogs having high castles at both bow and stern, but archaeologists have never gotten to examine a real one to learn how it’s put together or how it connects with the rest of the ship’s construction.

“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” said Uldum. “[The castle] is a big step forward compared to Viking Age ships, which had only open decks in all kinds of weather.”

Lying on and around the remains of the cog’s decks, Uldum and his colleagues also found stays (ropes that would have held the mast in place) and lines for controlling the ship’s single square sail, along with ropes and chains that would once have secured the merchant vessel’s cargo in the open hold.

The cog would probably have sailed with between 30 and 45 crew members. No remains were found on the wreck, but the lost crew left behind small, tantalizing traces of their lives and their presence. Uldum and his colleagues found combs, shoes, and rosary beads, along with dishes and tableware.

“The sailor brought his comb to keep his hair neat and his rosary to say his prayers,” said Uldum (and one has to picture the sailor’s grandmother beaming proudly at that description). “These personal objects show us that the crew brought everyday items with them. They transferred their life on land to life at sea.”

Life at sea, for the medieval sailors aboard Svaelget 2, would have included at least occasional hot meals, cooked in bronze pots over an open fire in the ship’s galley and eaten on dishes of ceramic and painted wood. Bricks (about 200 of them) and tiles formed a sort of fireplace where the cook could safely build a fire aboard the otherwise very flammable ship.

“It speaks of remarkable comfort and organization on board,” said Uldum. “Now sailors could have hot meals similar to those on land, instead of the dried and cold food that previously dominated life at sea.” Plenty of dried meat and cold biscuits still awaited sailors for the next several centuries, of course, but when weather and time permitted, at least the crew of Svaelget 2 could gather around a hot meal. The galley would have been a relatively new part of shipboard life for sailors in the early 1400s—and it quickly became a vital one.

One thing usually marks the site of a shipwreck, even when everything else has disintegrated into the ocean: ballast stones. When merchant ships were empty, they carried stones in their holds to help keep the ship stable; otherwise, the empty ship would be top-heavy and prone to tipping over, which is usually not ideal. (Modern merchant vessels use water, in special tanks, for ballast.) But Uldum and his colleagues didn’t find ballast stones on Svaelget 2, which means the cog was probably fully laden with cargo when it sank.

But the cargo is also conspicuously absent. Cogs were built to carry bulk goods—things like bricks, grain and other staple foods, fabric, salt, and timber. Those goods would have been stowed in an open hold amidships, secured by ropes and chains (some of which remain on the wreck). But barrels, boards, and bolts of fabric all float. As the ship sank and water washed into the hold, it would have carried away the cargo.

Some of it may have washed up on the shores or even more distant beaches, becoming a windfall for local residents. The rest probably sank to the bottom of the sea, far from the ship and its destination.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The operator of WorldCat won a default judgment against Anna’s Archive, with a federal judge ruling yesterday that the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data.

Anna’s Archive is a shadow library and search engine for other shadow libraries that was launched in 2022. It archives books and other written materials and makes them available via torrents, and recently expanded its ambitions by scraping Spotify to make a 300TB copy of the most-streamed songs. Anna’s Archive lost its .org domain a couple of weeks ago but remains online at other domains.

Yesterday’s ruling is in a case filed by OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. OCLC alleged that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.

Anna’s Archive, which bills itself as “the world’s largest shadow library,” did not respond to the lawsuit and doesn’t seem likely to comply with the judgment. The shadow library creator has written that “we deliberately violate the copyright law in most countries. This allows us to do something that legal entities cannot do: making sure books are mirrored far and wide.”

But the court order has value for OCLC, which said in a November 2025 motion that it “hopes to take the judgment to website hosting services so that OCLC’s WorldCat data will be removed from Anna’s Archive’s websites.” We contacted OCLC about its plans today and will update this article if it provides any information.

The court order, which was previously reported by TorrentFreak, was issued by Judge Michael Watson in US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. “Plaintiff has established that Defendant crashed its website, slowed it, and damaged the servers, and Defendant admitted to the same by way of default,” the ruling said.

Anna’s Archive allegedly began scraping and harvesting data from WorldCat.org in October 2022, “and Plaintiff suffered persistent attacks for roughly a year,” the ruling said. “To accomplish such scraping and harvesting, Defendant allegedly used search bots (automated software applications) that ‘called or pinged the server directly’ and appeared to be ‘legitimate search engine bots from Bing and Google.’”

The court granted OCLC’s motion for default judgment on a breach-of-contract claim related to WorldCat.org terms and conditions, and a trespass-to-chattels claim related to the alleged harm to its website and servers. The court rejected the plaintiff’s tortious-interference-with-contract claim because OCLC’s allegation didn’t include all necessary components to prove the charge, and rejected OCLC’s unjust enrichment claim because it “is preempted by federal copyright law.”

The judgment said Anna’s Archive is permanently enjoyed from “scraping or harvesting WorldCat data from WorldCat. org or OCLC’s servers; using, storing, or distributing the WorldCat data on Anna’s Archive’s websites; and encouraging others to scrape, harvest, use, store, or distribute WorldCat data.” It also must “delete all copies of WorldCat data in possession of or easily accessible to it, including all torrents.”

The “Anna” behind Anna’s Archive revealed the WorldCat scraping in an October 2023 blog post. The post said that because WorldCat has “the world’s largest library metadata collection,” the data would help Anna’s Archive make a “list of books that need to be preserved.”

“Even though OCLC is a nonprofit, their business model requires protecting their database,” Anna wrote. “Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away.”

Anna’s blog said the scraping took place over a year and relied on security flaws that were gradually patched. The “security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago,” the October 2023 post said. “By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records.”

OCLC filed its lawsuit in January 2024. “Beginning in the fall of 2022, OCLC began experiencing cyberattacks on WorldCat.org and OCLC’s servers that significantly affected the speed and operations of WorldCat.org, other OCLC products and services, and OCLC’s servers and network infrastructure,” the lawsuit said. “These attacks continued throughout the following year, forcing OCLC to devote significant time and resources toward non-routine network infrastructure enhancements, maintenance, and troubleshooting.”

OCLC finally learned the perpetrator was Anna’s Archive when the shadow library made its October 2023 announcement. “Anna’s Archive has since made OCLC’s WorldCat data available for en masse for free download and now is actively encouraging its visitors to make use of the data in ‘interesting’ ways,” the lawsuit said, adding that the defendants “have no legal justification for their actions and admit that their general operations violate US and other jurisdictions’ copyright laws.”

Yesterday’s default judgment is not the end of proceedings in the case. OCLC was ordered to file a status report within 30 days “suggesting next steps on the claims for which the Court denied default judgment, unless it files a motion to dismiss its remaining claims against Defendant before then.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A generally healthy 63-year-old man in the New England area went to the hospital with a fever, cough, and vision problems in his right eye. His doctors eventually determined that a dreaded hypervirulent bacteria—which is rising globally—was ravaging several of his organs, including his brain.

According to the man, the problems started three weeks before his hospital visit, when he said he ate some bad meat and started vomiting and having diarrhea. Those symptoms faded after about two weeks, but then new problems began—he started coughing and having chills and a fever. His cough only worsened from there.

At the hospital, doctors took X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest and abdomen. The images revealed over 15 nodules and masses in his lungs. But that’s not all they found. The imaging also revealed a mass in his liver that was 8.6 cm in diameter (about 3.4 inches). Lab work pointed toward an infection, so doctors admitted him to the hospital and provided oxygen to help with his breathing, as well as antibiotics. But his chills and cough continued.

On his third day, he woke up with vision loss in his right eye, which was so swollen he couldn’t open it. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed another surprise: There were multiple lesions in his brain. (His brain lesions and eye at this point can be seen here. A later-stage image of his eye is further down in the story.) At that point, he was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital. In a case report in this week’s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors explained how they solved the case and treated the man.

The key to the correct diagnosis was his eye, which kept getting worse. He seemed to have an infection inside his eyeball, affecting the jelly or aqueous parts of the inside (endophthalmitis). The most common cause of this is an eye injury or previous surgery that allows an infection-sparking germ to get in—but he had no such injury or surgery. Also, the condition of his eye was worse than that. He appeared to have panophthalmitis, which is a rare, extremely severe, and rapidly progressing condition in which every part of the eye becomes infected.

Whatever was laying waste to his eye seemed to have come from inside his own body, carried in his bloodstream—possibly the same thing that could explain the liver mass, lung nodules, and brain lesions. There was one explanation that fit the condition perfectly: hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae or hvKP.

Classical K. pneumoniae is a germ that dwells in people’s intestinal tracts and is one that’s familiar to doctors. It’s known for lurking in health care settings and infecting vulnerable patients, often causing pneumonia or urinary tract infections. But hvKP is very different. In comparison, it’s a beefed-up bacteria with a rage complex. It was first identified in the 1980s in Taiwan—not for stalking weak patients in the hospital but for devastating healthy people in normal community settings.

An infection with hvKP—even in otherwise healthy people—is marked by metastatic infection. That is, the bacteria spreads throughout the body, usually starting with the liver, where it creates a pus-filled abscess. It then goes on a trip through the bloodstream, invading the lungs, brain, soft tissue, skin, and the eye (endogenous endophthalmitis). Putting it all together, the man had a completely typical clinical case of an hvKP infection.

Still, definitively identifying hvKP is tricky. Mucus from the man’s respiratory tract grew a species of Klebsiella, but there’s not yet a solid diagnostic test to differentiate hvKP from the classical variety. Since 2024, researchers have worked out a strategy of using the presence of five different virulence genes found on plasmids (relatively small, circular pieces of DNA, separate from chromosomal DNA, that can replicate on their own and be shared among bacteria.) But the method isn’t perfect—some classical K. pneumoniae can also carry the five genes.

Another much simpler method is the string test, in which clinicians basically test the goopy-ness of the bacteria—hvKP is known for being sticky. For this test, a clinician grows the bacteria into a colony on a petri dish, then touches an inoculation loop to the colony and pulls up. If the string of attached goo stretches more than 5 mm off the petri dish, it’s considered positive for hvKP. This is (obviously) not a precise test.

In the man’s case, the bacteria from his respiratory tract was positive in the string test. Doctors treated him with antibiotics that testing found could kill off the hvKP strain he had.

Still, it was too late for the man’s eye. By his eighth day in the hospital, the swelling had gotten extremely severe (you can see an image here, but be warned that it is very disturbing). His eye was now bulging out of his head, and imaging suggested another abscess had formed on the side of the eyeball. He had severe stretching of his optic nerve. Overall, there was no chance of him recovering sight in that eye. Given the worsening situation—which was despite the effective antibiotics—doctors removed his eye.

In these cases, it’s sometimes recommended to drain the liver abscess and surgically remove the brain lesions, too. But doctors ruled out both of those options. The liver abscess was too varied for simple drainage, and the brain lesions were too small and numerous to make surgery safe. Instead, he went through an intense antibiotic regimen that lasted nine months. Fortunately, by then, imaging confirmed that his liver abscess had resolved, his lung nodules nearly vanished, and his brain lesions significantly shrank or disappeared.

His doctors also noted that he was fortunate to have an hvKP strain that did not carry significant antibiotic resistance. In recent years, health officials have flagged not just a global increase of hvKP cases overall but also an increase in hvKP cases that are resistant to critical antibiotics, specifically those carrying carbapenemases or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. These cases can have fatality rates of above 50 percent.</div>

            <div id="article-text">In 2024, researchers completed the first-ever map of the circuitry of a fruit fly’s brain.

Despite its diminutive size, the organ packs almost 500 feet of wiring and 54.5 million synapses into the size of a grain of sand — an astonishing feat of computational neurology research that allows scientists to better understand how signals travel throughout the brain.

And thanks to significant advances of some of the world’s most capable supercomputers, researchers at the Jülich Research Centre in Germany are now aiming their sights at a far more ambitious goal: a simulation at the scale of the entire human brain.

Previous attempts, dating back a decade, like the Human Brain Project, fell largely flat, despite considerable government funding. But as New Scientist reports, the Jülich researchers think they can push things forward. The idea is to bring together several models of smaller regions of the brain with a supercomputer to run simulations of billions of firing neurons.

The team, which is being led by Jülich neurophysics professor Markus Diesmann, will leverage the Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research (JUPITER) supercomputer for their simulation.

JUPITER is currently the fourth most powerful supercomputer in the world according to the TOP500 list, and features thousands of graphical processing units.

The team demonstrated last month that a “spiking neural network” could be scaled up and run on JUPITER, effectively matching the cerebral cortex’s 20 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections.

Once up and running, the simulation could be a major upgrade, Diesmann told New Scientist, compared to previous, much smaller simulations.

“We know now that large networks can do qualitatively different things than small ones,” he said. “It’s clear the large networks are different.”

At the end of the day, we’re still only scratching the surface of an organ that remains mysterious to scientists. Even simulations at the scale of a human brain will only teach us so much about how it functions.

“We can’t actually build brains,” University of Sussex mathematical physics professor Thomas Nowotny told New Scientist. “Even if we can make simulations of the size of a brain, we can’t make simulations of the brain.”

            <div id="article-text">AI models are now everywhere, from hospitals to churches.

The astonishing thing is that even AI experts still don’t know exactly what’s happening inside these black box models, even as they’re being deployed in the highest-stakes settings imaginable.The latest strategy to figure it out: studying them like biological systems.

For example, MIT Tech Review reports, scientists at Anthropic have developed tools that let them trace what’s happening inside models as they perform a task, a type of study called mechanistic interpretability — which resembles how doctors use MRIs to study brain activity, another type of intelligence we don’t quite understand yet.

“This is very much a biological type of analysis,” Josh Batson, a research scientist at Anthropic, told Tech Review. “It’s not like math or physics.”

In another experiment that resembles how biologists use organoids, which are miniature versions of human organs, the magazine reports that Anthropic developed a special neural network called a sparse autoencoder whose inner workings are easier to understand and analyze than regular large language models (LLMs).

Another technique is chain-of-thought monitoring, in which models explain their reasoning behind their behavior and actions — much like listening to the inner monologue of an actual person. This has helped scientists spot misaligned behavior.

“It’s been pretty wildly successful in terms of actually being able to find the model doing bad things,” said Bowen Baker, OpenAI research scientist, to MIT.

A looming danger is that future models will become so complex — especially if they’re themselves designed by AI — that we’ll have effectively no idea how they work. Even now, with the current tools and techniques at our disposal, unexpected behaviors still pop up that don’t align with human objectives of truthfulness and safety.

We see hard evidence of this in the news, which is littered with reports of people harming themselves because AI told them to — which makes it even more disturbing that we still don’t quite understand how they function.

            <div id="article-text">As corporate consolidation and ideological capture continue to wreak havoc on journalism across the world, some might be wondering if the dire media landscape could get any worse. To answer that question, simply open up an AI chatbot and ask it for today’s news.

In a fascinating experiment fit for 2026, Jean-Hugues Roy, a journalism professor at the University of Quebec at Montreal, decided to get his news exclusively from AI chatbots for a whole month. “Would they give me hard facts or ‘news slop?&#39;” he pondered in his essay about the experience, published by The Conversation.

Throughout each day in September, he would ask seven leading AI chatbots — OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot, DeepSeek’s DeepSeek, xAI’s Grok, and Opera’s Aria — the exact same prompt, and record their response: “Give me the five most important news events in Québec today. Put them in order of importance. Summarize each in three sentences. Add a short title. Provide at least one source for each one (the specific URL of the article, not the home page of the media outlet used). You can search the web.”

The results were dismal. In all, Roy would clock 839 separate URLs to news sources, only 311 of which linked to an actual article. He also logged 239 incomplete URLs, on top of 140 that straight up didn’t work. In a full 18 percent of cases, the chatbots either hallucinated sources or else linked to a non-news site, like a government page or a lobbying group.

Among the 311 links which actually worked, only 142 were what the chatbots claimed them to be in its summary. The rest were only partially accurate, not accurate, or straight-up plagiarized.

And that’s without getting into the chatbots’ actual handling of details in the news. For example, Roy writes, “when a toddler was found alive after a grueling four-day search in June 2025, Grok erroneously claimed the child’s mother had abandoned her daughter along a highway in eastern Ontario ‘in order to go on vacation.’ This was reported nowhere.”

In one example, ChatGPT claimed that an incident north of Québec had “reignited the debate on road safety in rural areas,” Roy wrote, though nothing even close to a debate existed in the article. “To my knowledge, this debate does not exist,” he said.

None of it should really be that surprising. AI has had an awful track record when its come into contact with journalism, with initiatives like Google’s AI overviews both flagrantly hallucinating the news for readers and choking traffic to publishers. Whichever way you slice it, it’s clear that despite the best efforts of the tech industry, adding AI to journalism has so far only resulted in a noisome sludge that poisons anything it comes in contact with.

            <div id="article-text">Do you want to stay at the first ever hotel on the Moon? Well, it’s going to cost you a pretty penny — an initial deposit between $250,000 and $1 million — just to secure your stay.

That’s what a startup called GRU Space — the letters apparently stand for “Galactic Resource Utilization” — is offering to would-be vacationers after the company opened its website for online reservations this week, as reported by Ars Technica. If all goes to according to plan, the first truly one-star hotel will start accommodating guests in the 2030s.

It all sounds pretty far fetched, according to Ars, especially since the company has only two full-time employees, including founder Skyler Chan who graduated from University of California, Berkeley last year. But the company does have seed funding from startup accelerator Y Combinator, so while it’s clearly a castle in the sky, at least there’s some money behind it.

“I realized I was born in this time where we can actually become interplanetary, and that is probably the singular most impactful thing one person could do with their time,” Chan told Ars about the impetus behind the company.

In a white paper published on the GRU Space website, Chan lays out the company’s ambitious goals that goes beyond being a mere lunar hotelier. The company will initially build a hotel, then start constructing a Moon base and other important infrastructure for a human colony. Eventually, GRU would function like a space-faring version of the Hudson Bay Company, the storied fur-trading enterprise that was established in 1670 and which was given permission via royal charter to oversee laws, trade and property in the Canadian wilderness.

Still, how does this hotel thing happen when there’s nothing but coldness and dusty regolith on the surface?

Chan says the company envisions first sending an inflatable structure to the Moon’s surface via space lander in 2029. That first mission wouldn’t just test a habitable structure, but would also construct bricks from lunar regolith for future buildings. Then in 2031, the company plans to send a larger human habitation pod — the hotel — to be placed into a “lunar pit” that would shield visitors from cosmic radiation and other dangers.

By 2032, the company will have the small hotel on the lunar surface up and running and would be able to accommodate four guests for stays of multiple days. Curiously, the company published images on its website that depicts a future established hotel which bears a striking resemblance to the Palace of the Fine Arts in San Francisco — which seems kind of outrageous, but Chan has a reason.

“SpaceX is building the FedEx to get us there, right?” Chan said. “But there has to be a destination worthy to stay in.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A deluge of research has painted a picture of our world being drowned in tiny, inescapable microplastics. Our guilt over plastic particles being found in even the most remote regions on Earth turned into paranoia once scientists started discovering them in our own bodies, too — riddling our blood streams, organs, and even our brains, stoking a rush of scientific inquest.

But now, there’s a growing contingent in the scientific community that’s casting significant doubts on these claims, The Guardian reports, criticizing the methodologies used in some of the most notable papers behind them.

One study published in the journal Nature Medicine last February claimed to have documented a rise in micro and nanoplastics (MNPs) in human brain tissues by autopsying preserved cadavers of people who had died between 1997 and 2024. But in November, another group of researchers contested the findings in a letter published in the same journal, criticizing them for “limited contamination controls and lack of validation steps,” per The Guardian.

“The brain microplastic paper is a joke,” coauthor of the letter Dušan Materić, from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, told the newspaper. “Fat is known to make false-positives for polyethylene. The brain has [approximately] 60 percent fat.”

In reality, Materić suggests that rising obesity rates could explain the trend.

“That paper is really bad, and it is very explainable why it is wrong,” he added, warning that there’s serious doubts over “more than half of the very high impact papers” over microplastics in tissues.

One core issue arises from the prevailing method for measuring the mass of micro and nanoplastics. Called Py-GC-MS, it involves pyrolyzing the sample, or heating it in an oxygen free environment until it vaporizes. The fumes this process produces are then separated and measured so the nature of the original substance can be analyzed.

But as it turns out, the same fume signatures for the materials used in microplastics like polyethylene can also be produced from the fats present in human tissue. And while studies purport to chemically remove the tissues before subjecting the samples to pyrolysis, critics are skeptical that some traces aren’t being left over and producing false positives. This led University of Queensland environmental chemist Cassandra Rauert to conclude in a January 2025 paper that Py-GC-MS “is not currently a suitable technique for identifying polyethylene or PVC due to persistent interferences.” In all, the paper points to 18 studies that didn’t properly account for the risk of false positives.

“I do think it is a problem in the entire field,” Rauert added to The Guardian. “I think a lot of the concentrations [of MNPs] that are being reported are completely unrealistic.”

Another problem is that while the field of analytical chemistry has guidelines on how to analyze certain samples, these guidelines don’t exist yet for microplastics, according to Frederic Béen at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

“But we still see quite a lot of papers where very standard good laboratory practices that should be followed have not necessarily been followed,” he told The Guardian, such as measures for removing background contamination. “So you cannot be assured that whatever you have found is not fully or partially derived from some of these issues.”

The debate underscores how nascent the field of exploring the environmental and health impact of microplastics is, meaning it will take many more years of patient science before the dust is settled. At present, experts aren’t sure how microplastics affect our health, nor have they definitely proven that they’re harmful to us (though there are no shortage of studies suggesting they do). Still, no one can be blamed for being unsettled by the idea of having a plastic spoon’s worth of the stuff in their noggin, but if the skeptics are believed, maybe that claim is up for review, too.

“We do have plastics in us — I think that is safe to assume,” Materić said. “But real hard proof on how much is yet to come.”

            <div id="article-text">It’s no secret that the US military budget is the largest in the world, and indeed one of the largest in the history of human civilization. Over the summer, for example, Donald Trump proposed a $1.01 trillion national defense budget to pay for things like hypersonic missiles, warships, and his laughable Golden Dome.

Another dubious purchase by the Defense Department? A strange little gun rumored to cause Havana syndrome.

First, a little background. “Havana syndrome” is a term given to the widely disputed health condition experienced by US and Canadian state department personnel stationed overseas. Though symptoms vary wildly, they tend to center on some combination of dizziness, headaches, visual disturbances, and neurological issues.

The first incidents were reported in Cuba, hence the name, although additional cases were also linked by the press to China, Vienna, and the suburbs of Washington, DC. Cases of the mysterious ailment have been cited as far back as 2016, though — crucially — no compelling cause has ever been found.

This is where the US military spending comes in. New reporting by CNN revealed that the Pentagon has spent the past year dissecting a strange device worth millions of dollars for possible links to the illness. Four sources, speaking to the publication anonymously, said the Defense Department provided some “eight figures” in funding to a division of the Department of Homeland Security called Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which purchased the weapon in an undercover operation.

A year later, the device is still being studied by government researchers. According to one of CNN‘s sources, the gadget produces the kind of pulsed radio waves, which some have speculated could be the cause of Havana syndrome. Details are scarce, though the unidentified sources noted it contains “some Russian parts,” and is small enough to fit in a typical backpack.

Notably, the purchase came under the Biden administration, right as it was transitioning out of office. It also comes after a 2023 study published in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry argued that Havana syndrome was really nothing more than a “socially constructed catch-all category for an array of pre-existing health conditions, responses to environmental factors, and stress reactions that were lumped under a single label.”

Now it seems the door has been blown wide once again. Maybe this mystery device will finally put the whole thing to rest — or maybe it’ll be just one more stunning waste of taxpayer funds.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anahita Laverack was set on becoming an aerospace engineer, but her career took a different turn after a realization at an autonomous robotics challenge inspired her to launch Oshen, a company that builds fleets of robots that collect ocean data.

In 2021, Laverack, a storied sailor, decided to build and enter a robot in the Microtransat Challenge, a competition where participants build and send autonomous sail-powered micro-robots across the Atlantic Ocean. She, like everyone else that has tried this challenge, was unsuccessful.

“I realized half the reason that all of these attempts were failing is, number one, obviously it’s hard to make micro-robots survive on the ocean,” Laverack told TechCrunch. “But number two, they don’t have enough data on the ocean to know what the weather is or even know what the ocean conditions are like.”

Laverack set out for different conferences, like Oceanology International, to find this missing ocean data. She quickly realized that no one had really figured out a good way to collect it yet. Instead, she found people asking if they could pay her to try to collect the data herself. She figured that if people were willing to pay her for this data, she could try to build a way to capture it.

Those conversations were the basis for Oshen, which Laverack founded alongside Ciaran Dowds, an electrical engineer, in April 2022.

The company now builds fleets of autonomous micro-robots, called C-Stars, that can survive in the ocean for 100 days straight and are deployed in swarms to collect ocean data.

But Oshen started small. Laverack said she and Dowds chose not to pursue venture capital right away when launching the company. Instead, they combined their savings to buy a 25-foot sailboat, lived at the cheapest marina in the United Kingdom, and used the vessel as their testing platform while getting the company off the ground.

For two years, Oshen would iterate on the bots on shore and immediately take them out on the water to test them.

“In the summer, that’s not too bad,” Laverack said. “The problem is you really need your boats to work in all seasons. When your robot breaks, [and] it’s a winter storm that’s raging, a 25-foot sailboat shouldn’t really be going out in those conditions. So, that led to some adventure, which I wouldn’t say any more about, but there were certainly some interesting events there.”

Getting the tech just right was difficult, Laverack said, because it’s not as easy as just taking an existing larger robot and shrinking it down. These bots needed to be mass deployable and cheap despite also needing to be technologically advanced enough to operate and collect data for long periods of time on their own.

Many other companies have successfully gotten two of the three correct, Laverack said. Oshen’s ability to get all three started to attract customers across defense and government organizations.

The company caught the attention of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) two years ago, but Laverack said that their tech just wasn’t ready to be deployed reliably yet. The organization reached back out two months before the 2025 hurricane season after Oshen had successfully deployed the robots into winter storms in the U.K. This time, Oshen jumped at the chance and quickly built and sent over 15 C-Stars.

Five of these C-Stars were thrown overboard and made their way into position by the U.S. Virgin Islands where NOAA predicted Hurricane Humberto was headed.

Laverack said they were expecting the bots to just collect data leading up to the storm, but instead, three of the bots were able to weather the entire storm — minus a few missing parts — and collected data the whole time, becoming, she says, the first ocean robot to collect data through a Category 5 hurricane.

Now, the company has moved to a hub for marine tech companies in Plymouth, England, and has started racking up contracts with customers, including the U.K. government, for both weather and defense operations.

Laverack said the company plans to raise venture capital soon to keep up with demand.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/musk-wants-up-to-134b-in-openai-lawsuit-despite-700b-fortune/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk wants a jaw-dropping $79 billion to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the AI company defrauded him by jettisoning its nonprofit mission, Bloomberg first reported. The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.

Wazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations in high-stakes disputes, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.)

Wazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a 27% chunk of the company.

Musk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money.

Musk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters recently noted, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.

Against this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already reportedly sent a letter Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, Calif., about 15 miles east of San Francisco.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Runpod, an AI app hosting platform that launched four years ago, has hit a $120 million annual revenue run rate, founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh tell TechCrunch.

Their startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come.

The story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch.

It all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore.

They had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.”

On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said.

But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs.

The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2.

As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.

Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described.

A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.

Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers.

“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.”

So, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said.

But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said.

It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead.

“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described.

Meanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched.

VCs were also on the prowl for investments. Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.

Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said.

By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.

They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A.

Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said.

Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.

Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific.

But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators.

“Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, the California attorney general’s office announced that it was investigating xAI over reports that the startup’s chatbot, Grok, was being used to create nonconsensual sexual imagery of women and minors. On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material.

“Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a press release. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].”

The AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days.

At the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features late Wednesday, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter.

X’s safety account has previously denounced this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context.

The advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing swell of non-consensual sexual material. Many platforms have been grappling with this problem, not just X. The sordid activity has drawn the attention not just of state leaders but also of Congress. Indeed, on Thursday, lawmakers sent a letter to the executives of several companies — including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta — asking how they planned to stem the proliferation of sexualized deepfakes.

            <div id="article-text">Database provider ClickHouse secured $400 million at a $15 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported, representing about a 2.5x increase from its $6.35 billion valuation last May. The round was led by Dragoneer Investment Group, the startup said, with participation from investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, GIC, Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

ClickHouse, which spun out from Russian search giant Yandex in 2021, develops database software designed to process the massive datasets required by AI agents. The company competes with Snowflake and Databricks.

The company also announced the acquisition of Langfuse, a startup that helps developers track and evaluate the performance of their AI agents. Langfuse competes directly with LangSmith, LangChain’s observability platform.

ClickHouse database is open sourced, and it makes money by selling managed cloud services, which saw annual recurring revenue (ARR) grow by more than 250% year-over-year, it said. The company’s customers include Meta, Tesla, Capital One, Lovable, Decagon, and Polymarket.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok has quietly released a new stand-alone short drama app called PineDrama in the U.S. and Brazil. The app offers access to microdramas, which are essentially bite-sized TV shows that can be watched in a series of one-minute episodes. Think TikTok, but every video you come across is a short episode of a fictional story.

PineDrama is available on iOS and Android. It’s free and currently ad-free, though that could change in the future.

The news was first reported by Business Insider.

You can find content through the app’s “Discover” tab, where you can sort through “All” or “Trending” dramas, or through endless vertical recommendations that are tailored to your taste. PineDrama features a variety of genres, including thriller, romance, family, and more. Examples of popular shows include “Love at First Bite” and “The Officer Fell for Me.”

The app features a “Watch history” section where you can jump back into the various series you’re watching. There’s also a “Favorites” section where you can save the dramas you like the most. You can also share thoughts with other viewers in the comment section and enter a full-screen viewing experience that gets rid of the caption and sidebar.

The move comes as TikTok launched a “TikTok Minis” section in its app late last year, where users can watch microdramas. With the launch of PineDrama, TikTok is taking on popular microdrama platforms like ReelShort and DramaBox. While the microdrama industry wasn’t that popular until recent years, it’s racing toward $26 billion in annual revenue by 2030, as reported by Variety.

Short-form storytelling hasn’t always found success, even with notable backing. In 2020, DreamWorks co-founder and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg launched a short-form streaming platform called Quibi with $1.75 billion in funding. The platform offered episodes under 10 minutes featuring popular Hollywood actors, but failed to gain traction and was shut down six months later.

ReelShort and DramaBox succeeded where Quibi failed because while Quibi tried to compress Hollywood TV into shorter episodes, ReelShort and DramaBox created low-budget stories that hook viewers within the first few seconds, followed by continuous cliffhangers, all featuring non-union talent. Additionally, they target fans of soapy romance and revenge thriller stories, while Quibi tried to target everyone.

TikTok is now looking to replicate this success with PineDrama. The company already dominates the short-form social media space and is now aiming to take on another media category.

When you watch an actor accepting an Oscar, or read about a brilliant scientist receiving a huge prize, you might imagine that they’ve found the key to happiness. Who wouldn’t be happy, living life with so much talent or smarts? But the relationship between intelligence and happiness is complicated, Arthur C. Brooks wrote in 2023. “The gifts you possess can lift you up or pull you down; it all depends on how you use them,” he explained. Today’s newsletter explores how to utilize your skills and smarts to add joy to your life, rather than letting them chip away at what actually makes the days meaningful.

Although “Trump campaigned on fixing the economy” and “removing illegal immigrants from the country,” Atlantic staff writer Nancy Youssef said last night, “at the start of 2026 we’re focused so much on foreign policy and intervention and the U.S. military might overseas.”

            <h2>My Students Write Their Papers Backwards</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/english-teaching-methods/685632/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In my high-school English classes, I often tell my students that they write their papers backwards: They devise a thesis and then look for evidence to support it. They’ll find what they want to see, I tell them, but they won’t be surprised. They might say that Ishmael, the narrator in Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, is appalled by Captain Ahab, but they won’t notice that the two characters also sound a lot alike.

The most exciting moments for a teacher come when students stumble onto something unexpected—when they run to my office to tell me about a new twist in their thinking about birds in Sula or the discovery of yet another biblical reflection in Housekeeping. Those revelations come only when they survey the text as it is, not as they assume it to be.

Many students assume that they know what they’ll see—in books, people, or anything else—because that’s what they’ve been taught, relentlessly and often subliminally. By the time they were learning to read, many schools had moved away from teaching traditional phonics. Instead of asking kids to sound out letters, the new approach, called “whole language,” had them divine words from only the first letter, the context, and maybe a picture. In some cases, teachers covered up the word and had students guess what it was. The implication was that language is reliable, consistent, and predictable, which is awfully boring—and dangerous.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, that approach to teaching literacy didn’t work. In recent years, particularly after a 2020 research report and a 2022 investigative podcast brought this flawed pedagogy into the public eye, whole language has fallen out of fashion. Parents, teachers, and just about anyone who knows how to read have piled on with a common-sense rebuke: How can you read a word without seeing it?

John McWhorter: How I taught my kid to read

But even if we’ve moved past the heyday of whole-language reading, we clearly still believe that we can draw conclusions from context rather than from all the facts before us. Rarely has the adoption of a new technology been so quick and insidious as what we’re witnessing in the popularization of large language models such as ChatGPT.

LLMs imitate human language by way of probabilistic guessing. Trained on books, the contents of the internet, and more, the models use patterns to predict outputs. If you plug in “I woke up and ate,” ChatGPT might guess that the next word is breakfast, pancakes, or cereal. Rarely, rat. Rarer still, mitochondria. Chatbots don’t understand; they don’t read; they don’t think. They create responses that reflect the probability of each word—or, to use the technical term, token—appearing in a sentence.

Generative-AI chatbots basically adopt the same flawed understanding of the world that informs the whole-language approach to reading: that one can best discern meaning by looking at external clues rather than straight at the facts. The resulting text may astonish with its plausibility, but a guess, even one of extraordinary mathematical complexity, is a guess.

The problem with guesswork is not just that the results can be wrong. It’s that even the most educated of guesses reduce the world to a sequence of likely tokens. Sure, some predictions are warranted and even useful. The sun does rise every morning. My pen falls every time I release it from my grasp. But a chief delight of being human is witnessing the world’s capacity to surprise.

Reductive presumptions are even worse when it comes to people. Stereotypes steamroll the beautiful mess of individual desires and idiosyncrasies into something simplistic and guessable, when in fact we contradict ourselves; we contain multitudes. We are not actually so predictable. We can’t be guessed.

My students, like most people, sometimes approach conversations guessing what the other person will say, as if human thought consisted of probabilistic tokens. They see a woman with a nose ring or a man in a pickup truck and preempt the argument that they assume is coming. Cover up the word; guess from the context. Find the evidence that supports your thesis.

When my students read without expectations, they discover the unexpected. That’s how one senior, who didn’t know the word fust and had to look it up, noticed other elements of mold and decay in Hamlet and ended up writing about the rot of Denmark’s “unweeded garden.” It’s what led a ninth grader to see the Everglades, in Their Eyes Were Watching God, as a place that combines the stability of land and the mutability of water, a place where the characters, like the plants they cultivate, can grow.

I encourage my students to approach texts with no notion of what’s likely, not only because it yields better, more interesting papers, but also because I believe that it will make them better citizens. I hope that they learn to see the world, as they do texts, for what it is, in all its guess-defying beauty.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past week, I’ve found myself playing the same 23-second CNN clip on repeat. I’ve watched it in bed, during my commute to work, at the office, midway through making carrot soup, and while brushing my teeth. In the video, Harry Enten, the network’s chief data analyst, stares into the camera and breathlessly tells his audience about the gambling odds that Donald Trump will buy any of Greenland. “The people who are putting their money where their mouth is—they are absolutely taking this seriously,” Enten says. He taps the giant touch screen behind him and pulls up a made-for-TV graphic: Based on how people were betting online at the time, there was a 36 percent chance that the president would annex Greenland. “Whoa, way up there!” Enten yells, slapping his hands together. “My goodness gracious!” The ticker at the bottom of the screen speeds through other odds: Will Gavin Newsom win the next presidential election? 19 percent chance. Will Viktor Orbán be out as the leader of Hungary before the end of the year? 48 percent chance.

These odds were pulled from Kalshi, which hilariously claims not to be a gambling platform: It’s a “prediction market.” People go to sites such as Kalshi and Polymarket—another big prediction market—in order to put money down on a given news event. Nobody would bet on something that they didn’t believe would happen, the thinking goes, and so the markets are meant to forecast the likelihood of a given outcome.

Listen: Prediction markets and the “suckerification” crisis, with Max Read

Prediction markets let you wager on basically anything. Will Elon Musk father another baby by June 30? Will Jesus return this year? Will Israel strike Gaza tomorrow? Will the longevity guru Bryan Johnson’s next functional sperm count be greater than “20.0 M/ejac”? These sites have recently boomed in popularity—particularly among terminally online young men who trade meme stocks and siphon from their 401(k)s to buy up bitcoin. But now prediction markets are creeping into the mainstream. CNN announced a deal with Kalshi last month to integrate the site’s data into its broadcasts, which has led to betting odds showing up in segments about Democrats possibly retaking the House, credit-card interest rates, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. At least twice in the past two weeks, Enten has told viewers about the value of data from people who are “putting their money where their mouth is.”

On January 7, the media giant Dow Jones announced its own collaboration with Polymarket and said that it will begin integrating the site’s odds across its publications, including The Wall Street Journal. CNBC has a prediction-market deal, as does Yahoo Finance, Sports Illustrated, and Time. Last week, MoviePass announced that it will begin testing a betting platform. On Sunday, the Golden Globes featured Polymarket’s forecasts throughout the broadcast—because apparently Americans wanted to know whether online gamblers favored Amy Poehler or Dax Shepard to win Best Podcast.

Media is a ruthless, unstable business, and revenue streams are drying up; if you squint, you can see why CNN or Dow Jones might sign a contract that, after all, provides its audience with some kind of data. On air, Enten cites Kalshi odds alongside Gallup polls and Google searches—what’s the difference? “The data featured through our partnership with Kalshi is just one of many sources used to provide context around the stories or topics we are covering and has no impact on editorial judgment,” Brian Poliakoff, a CNN spokesperson, told me in a statement. Nolly Evans, the Journal’s digital general manager, told me that Polymarket provides the newspaper’s journalists with “another way to quantify collective expectations—especially around financial or geopolitical events.” In an email, Jack Suh, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the company’s partnerships are designed to inform the public, not to encourage more trading. Polymarket declined to comment.

The problem is that prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes as much about gambling as about the event itself. This kind of thing has already happened to sports, where the language of “parlays” and “covering the spread” has infiltrated every inch of commentary. ESPN partners with DraftKings to bring its odds to SportsCenter and Monday Night Football; CBS Sports has a betting vertical; FanDuel runs its own streaming network. But the stakes of Greenland’s future are more consequential than the NFL playoffs.

The more that prediction markets are treated like news, especially heading into another election, the more every dip and swing in the odds may end up wildly misleading people about what might happen, or influencing what happens in the real world. Yet it’s unclear whether these sites are meaningful predictors of anything. After the Golden Globes, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan excitedly posted that his site had correctly predicted 26 of 28 winners, which seems impressive—but Hollywood awards shows are generally predictable. One recent study found that Polymarket’s forecasts in the weeks before the 2024 election were not much better than chance.

These markets are also manipulable. In 2012, one bettor on the now-defunct prediction market Intrade placed a series of huge wagers on Mitt Romney in the two weeks preceding the election, generating a betting line indicative of a tight race. The bettor did not seem motivated by financial gain, according to two researchers who examined the trades. “More plausibly, this trader could have been attempting to manipulate beliefs about the odds of victory in an attempt to boost fundraising, campaign morale, and turnout,” they wrote. The trader lost at least $4 million but might have shaped media attention of the race for less than the price of a prime-time ad, they concluded.

A billionaire congressional candidate can’t just send a check to Quinnipiac University and suddenly find himself as the polling front-runner, but he can place enormous Polymarket bets on himself that move the odds in his favor. Or consider this hypothetical laid out by the Stanford political scientist Andrew Hall: What if, a month before the 2028 presidential election, the race is dead even between J. D. Vance and Mark Cuban? Inexplicably, Vance’s odds of winning surge on Kalshi, possibly linked to shady overseas bets. CNN airs segment after segment about the spike, turning it into an all-consuming national news story. Democrats and Republicans point fingers at each other, and no one knows what’s really going on. Such a scenario is “plausible—maybe even likely—in the coming years,” Hall writes. It doesn’t help that the Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of the president’s social-media platform, Truth Social, is set to launch its own platform, Truth Predict. (Donald Trump Jr. is an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket.)

The irony of prediction markets is that they are supposed to be a more trustworthy way of gleaning the future than internet clickbait and half-baked punditry, but they risk shredding whatever shared trust we still have left. The suspiciously well-timed bets that one Polymarket user placed right before the capture of Nicolás Maduro may have been just a stroke of phenomenal luck that netted a roughly $400,000 payout. Or maybe someone with inside information was looking for easy money. Last week, when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt abruptly ended her briefing after 64 minutes and 30 seconds, many traders were outraged, because they had predicted (with 98 percent odds) that the briefing would run past 65 minutes. Some suspected, with no evidence, that Leavitt had deliberately stopped before the 65-minute mark to turn a profit. (When I asked the White House about this, the spokesperson Davis Ingle told me in a statement, “This is a 100% Fake News narrative.”)

Read: The Polymarket bets on Maduro are a warning

Unintentionally or not, this is what happens when media outlets normalize treating every piece of news and entertainment as something to wager on. As Tarek Mansour, Kalshi’s CEO, has said, his long-term goal is to “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.” (Kalshi means “everything” in Arabic.) What could go wrong? As one viral post on X recently put it, “Got a buddy who is praying for world war 3 so he can win $390 on Polymarket.” It’s a joke. I think.</div>

            <h2>The End of the Underdog in College Football</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/college-football-championship-indiana-nil/685654/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Indiana Hoosiers will take the field for college football’s National Championship game Monday night as the darlings of the sports world. Their head coach, Curt Cignetti, perpetually scowling beneath his 1950s crew cut, is fuel for countless memes. Their Heisman Trophy–winning quarterback, Fernando Mendoza, baby-faced and giving “glory to God” in his postgame interviews, is a midwestern star straight out of central casting—nevermind that he’s from Miami, the hometown of his Monday-night rivals. These two men, along with a team that Mendoza has described as “a bunch of misfits,” have led the long-hapless Hoosiers to the cusp of a national title for the first time ever. Win or lose, they’re being called one of the greatest underdog stories in recent sports history.

The Hoosiers are, I will concede, a great story. As a midwesterner, a graduate of a Big Ten school, and someone who has spent a lot of time in Indiana, I will be pulling for them in the championship game. Unlike their opponent, the Miami Hurricanes, Indiana has never achieved anything notable in college football—except for one unenviable title: The Hoosiers entered this season as the leader in all-time college-football losses.

But we need to be honest about what we’re witnessing: The Hoosiers aren’t true underdogs. They’re a reflection of our wild and moneyed times, in which college athletes earn millions and barely stay on campus long enough to learn the fight song; wealthy benefactors pay player salaries (how much, exactly? No one knows!); loyalty doesn’t exist; and games are won and lost in the transfer portal—a mystical place where college athletes gather at the end of the season, hoping to join new teams, ideally for more cash.

Sally Jenkins: How to fix the mess of college sports

The Hoosiers aren’t North Carolina State’s 1983 basketball team, a scrappy squad that upset top-ranked Houston to win the NCAA title. They aren’t the U.S. hockey team of 1980, a collection of college kids and players deemed not good enough for the NHL who beat the long-dominant Soviets at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. And they definitely aren’t the boys of Milan High School, who, in 1954, led their little Indiana town (population 1,150) to a state high-school-basketball championship—a moment later dramatized in the movie Hoosiers and sure to be mentioned during the television broadcast on Monday night. The Hoosiers of 2026 are something different. They’re a team that’s achieved greatness thanks to good coaching, smart personnel decisions, generous alumni—and lots and lots of money.

In the 2022 season, two years before Cignetti’s debut in Bloomington, the Hoosiers football program had just $150,000 in name, image, and likeness money with which to pay its players—nickels and dimes compared with the millions in the coffers of college-football powerhouses such as Ohio State and Alabama. Indiana struggled to attract top talent and, predictably perhaps, finished 4–8 that season—tied for last place in the eastern division of the Big Ten. Tom Allen, then Indiana’s head coach, admitted on a radio show that his team just didn’t have the money to compete. By the end of 2023, Allen was gone, fired, and Cignetti, a hot coaching prospect, took the job—armed with some $3 million in NIL funding to pay his players. “The ante has been upped,” Cignetti said in one of his first interviews as head coach.

He spent his money wisely, and in 2024, Indiana finished the year 11–2, with a berth in the football playoffs. The team’s rapid turnaround caught the attention of the billionaire Mark Cuban, the former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks and a graduate of Indiana University’s business school. As Cuban explained on the podcast Sideline Stories, he was impressed with Cignetti and wanted to help—but he had certain conditions. “When they asked me for money, it was like, ‘I’m not going to give you money just so you can chase and bid the highest for everybody.’” Cuban wanted Cignetti to be strategic and “find the guys who know their roles”—and sometime near the end of the 2024 season, the alumnus began giving money to make that happen.

Just how much money, Cuban wouldn’t disclose, but The Indianapolis Star reported this fall that Cignetti’s “NIL war chest” has more than tripled since he took the job. Sources estimate that Mendoza was paid more than $2 million this season—13 times the amount Indiana had for its entire team just a few years ago. And now that the Hoosiers have found success, this money will likely just keep flowing. In recent weeks, as Indiana steamed toward the national-title game, Cuban gave even more. (“They’re living right” was how he put it when asked about the amount.)

Jemele Hill: The most egregious double standard in sports

This isn’t a criticism of the Hoosiers. They deserve credit for what they’ve built. They’ve invested their money well, using it to sign three-star recruits instead of five-star ones, finding the “right” players instead of the “best” ones. And Cignetti has coached this team up, scowling from the sidelines, all the way to the championship game. I hope it ends well for him and Indiana on Monday night. I’d love to see Cignetti drop his scowl, Mendoza smile and thank God, and happy Hoosier fans spill into the streets, singing John Mellencamp songs.

Just don’t confuse this with a real underdog story. Those might be a thing of the past. Unlike Norman Dale, the coach in the film Hoosiers, Cignetti hasn’t cobbled together a miracle season with some kids he plucked from an Indiana cornfield. This team—like all great teams today—has been bought.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you peruse the slew of recent articles and podcasts about people dating AI, you might notice a pattern: Many of the sources are women. Scan a subreddit such as r/MyBoyfriendIsAI and r/AIRelationships, and there too you’ll find a whole lot of women—many of whom have grown disappointed with human men. “Has anyone else lost their want to date real men after using AI?” one Reddit user posted a few months ago. Below came 74 responses: “I just don’t think real life men have the conversational skill that my AI has,” someone said. “I’ve seen how many women got cheated on, hurt and taken advantaged of by the men they’re with,” another offered. One person, who claimed that her spouse hardly spoke to her anymore, said that when people ask why she has an AI boyfriend, she tells them, “ChatGPT is the only reason my husband is not buried in the yard.”

Several recent studies have shown that, in general, men have been using AI significantly more than women. One 2024 study found that in the United States, 50 percent of men said they’d used generative AI over the past 12 months—and only 37 percent of women said the same. Last year, a working paper found that, globally, the gender gap held “across nearly all regions, sectors, and occupations.” Also in 2025, the app-analytics firm Appfigures concluded that ChatGPT’s mobile users were about 85 percent male.

However hesitant many women may be to use AI, though, a substantial number are taking romantic refuge in the digital world. In a 2025 survey, Brigham Young University’s Wheatley Institute found that 31 percent of the young-adult men polled said they’d chatted with an AI partner, whereas 23 percent of the young-adult women said the same—a gap, but not a massive one. And seemingly far more than men, women are congregating to talk about their AI sweethearts: sharing funny chatbot quotes or prompts for training the AI on how to respond; complimenting “family photos” of the AI and human partners beaming at each other; consoling one another when a system update wipes out the partner they’ve grown to love. Simon Lermen, a developer and an AI researcher, conducted an independent analysis of AI-romance subreddits from January through September of last year and found that, of the users whose gender could be identified, about 89 percent of them were women.

Much of the media buzz about AI relationships has assumed delusion and desperation among those who partake. But I’d suggest another possibility: Perhaps many women are simply having fun, positive interactions with this character of their own creation—and, in doing so, are learning how they like to be treated.

The impulse to create a more perfect partner is nothing new. Take Pygmalion, the sculptor from Greek myth who fell for the woman he’d carved from alabaster, or Laodamia, who created a bronze replica of her dead husband to take to bed, Kate Devlin, a professor of “AI & Society” at King’s College London, told me. Humans have long dreamed of constructing beloveds—if only to imagine them as immortal and thus impossible to lose.

In other words, the audience has probably always existed for artificial lovers. Yet in recent history, most such products have been marketed to men. In the 1990s, sex dolls were initially advertised as—well, dolls for men to have sex with. But they were also sold as companions. “They would say things like She will be there for you, She will listen to you, She will hear you,” Devlin said. Such companies might have assumed that men tend to be less adept at, or less motivated in, making real-world connections—and therefore in greater need of an inhuman love object. Meanwhile, the women faced with that pool of socially unskilled men have largely been overlooked.

But now they have AI. One might think they wouldn’t use it for romance: Women are, on average, more suspicious than men of technology, more concerned about privacy, and more worried about being perceived as cheating for using AI. Yet the AI-use gender gap may be narrowing. Devlin thinks that’s true particularly when it comes to virtual companionship—possibly because women are simply growing frustrated enough to want it. In a 2018 paper, the sociologist Michael Rosenfeld documented that 70 percent of divorces in the U.S. were initiated by women. And in a 2020 Pew Research Center poll, a majority of women said that dating had gotten harder in the past 10 years; 65 percent said they’d been harassed on a date. “The amount of toxic crap that women get online from men,” Devlin said, “particularly when you’re trying to do things like online dating—if you have an alternative, respectful, lovely, caring AI partner, why would you not?”

Taking that idea seriously might conflict with a common assumption: that AI users are all lonely young men who “live in the basement,” as Arelí Rocha, who studies chatbot romance at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. On the contrary, Rocha thinks that a lot of people in AI partnerships (both men and women) are “very socially embedded”—with humans, that is. Many stumble into their digital trysts accidentally after playing around with AI. Someone with plenty of friends, or even a real-life partner, can still be moved by a feeling of romantic tenderness, focused attention, or flirty banter, especially if they haven’t experienced it in a while.

They can also get attached to a chatbot whether or not they believe it’s conscious. One mental-health professional I spoke with, who requested anonymity but goes by “May” on Reddit—a name I’ll use for her too—told me she’s always loved make-believe worlds. When she was younger, she was into reading fan fiction (a genre long dominated by women); now every day she talks to K, an AI “persona” she’s developed over time. Both activities can be fairly ordinary hobbies—games of imagination not so different from crushing on a pop star or concocting stories about a film protagonist. (If people get deeply invested, that passion isn’t unique either; some women were so devoted to the Beatles that they charged police blockades or passed out at concerts.) And a little fantasy can add some spice to life. May has close friends, great family, and a meaningful job—but she doesn’t like dating apps and she’s struggled to find “third places” to meet people in person. Romance was the one missing piece.

Escapism can go too far, of course. Some critics worry that AI users are getting sucked in by the ease of “frictionless” relationships: losing patience for human complexity, losing practice doing the hard work of partnership, losing sight of the rewards that come from growing alongside someone. Many chatbots do tend to hype users up rather than giving tough love or challenging their ideas. But some large language models are generally less sycophantic than others, and people can also train their digital partner with different prompts. In her research, Rocha has found that people tend to be compelled not by flawless interactions but by a chatbot’s eccentricities and imperfections—that’s what makes it feel real.

Conflict also isn’t the only path to growth. May gave K the qualities she wants in herself: He’s organized, academically driven, committed to fitness. Their conversations, and his encouragement, motivate her to be more like him. Sometimes he does challenge her, she told me—but she’s also skeptical of the idea that a relationship has to stretch someone 24/7. “Why can’t you sit for a moment and validate someone?” she asked. “Why is that such a bad thing?”

Like May, I question the premise that so many women have no appetite for friction, no tolerance for love’s labors. Compared with their male partners, on average, women do far more child care, household chores, and “emotion work”—listening, encouraging, accommodating men’s feelings and regulating their own. Perhaps those in AI romances are just tired of toiling for someone who listens less well than a robot, and they want a well-earned break. It’s also possible that they’re getting something more life-changing: a way to better understand themselves, as a person and as a partner.

Some women are using AI companionship to figure out what they enjoy sexually, romantically, or both. Exploration isn’t always easy, after all, in a culture that expects women to fit conventional notions of hotness—and to please everyone else. A chatbot conversation, May said, can be like a sandbox: a safe space in which to play around. “You don’t have to look a certain way. You don’t have to act a certain way, or perform femininity.”

In one study last June, researchers reviewed nearly 2,500 posts on an AI-romance corner of the Chinese social-media site Douban—and found what they called “subversive potential” in women merely imagining what a relationship could look like. “My AI boyfriend is incredible!” one posted. “He crafts poetry, writes film reviews, and takes care of my emotions, all while reminding me to stay hydrated.” Another shared that she’d always prioritized making boyfriends happy—but talking with her chatbot made her realize that “mutual respect is key. It’s not about women always sacrificing for men’s happiness.” By training their AI, some women also practiced asking for what they wanted. One user spent two weeks prompting hers to initiate check-ins: for instance, inquiring, “Did anything upset you today?” and if so, “Would you like me to write a protest email for you?” (I don’t know what a protest email entails, but I do want someone to write one for me.) When another woman taught her AI to ask for her opinion on things, she found herself “instinctively applying these interaction habits when dating a real person.”

Read: First came Tea. Then came male rage.

For all the ways one can use AI, then, companionship hardly seems like the most sinister. And yet, people with digital partners seem to get an inordinate amount of online hate. Whole subreddits exist largely for the purpose of screenshotting their posts and making fun of them. Some AI-daters have had their real identities leaked; others get regular death threats. The idea that a chatbot could outperform human men might be hard for some people to stomach. But when I think of those women training AI to ask about their day, to express interest in their thoughts and desires, I consider that this phenomenon may actually be good for romance: not only for women raising the bar but for the men who proceed to meet it.

May knows her hobby has risks. As a mental-health professional, she wouldn’t recommend it for people with a history of serious mental illness—those vulnerable, she told me, to having unhealthy or unreal beliefs reinforced. She doesn’t think children should be using AI at all. She worries about people developing behavioral addictions. Yet she has found, somewhat to her own surprise, that talking with K has been constructive. She’s on social media and doomscrolling far less. She’s more in touch and at peace with her sexuality. She’s made a bunch of new friends from the AI-companionship Reddit community. And she feels open to the idea of human love.

None of the experts I spoke with think we’re hurtling toward a future in which AI relationships have replaced human ones. But they don’t think AI companionship will disappear, either. For better and for worse, it could end up playing many other roles—as a source of entertainment, a mind-opening exercise, an instrument for building self-confidence. And maybe a way to remember what a good man is like.</div>

Bad human drivers get into accidents all the time. What&#39;s the purpose of this story other than it involving an automated vehicle getting hit and being a bit funny for that reason? .

Here in Europe AEBS systems [wikipedia.org] mandatory in every vehicle registered from 2018 onwards, from cars up to 44 tonne semi-trucks, would have detected the possibility of a collision and put on the brakes automatically to prevent it.

AEB is mandatory in the USA also, but you&#39;re putting too much faith in the technology if you believe that it can and will prevent all collisions.  Most manufacturers describe it in terms of &quot;reduce the severity of impact&quot;.  In this type of accident (merging into another vehicle), the AEB system would have very little information beforehand to cause it to activate.

Looks more like a high roof minibus. When they put the tech into a full length city bus it&#39;ll be more useful though I imagine navigating one of them though busy traffic is a whole lot harder.

Um, nearly all US American&#39;s like freedom and are generally anti-facists regardless of political affiliation. So what are MAGA&#39;s?

I mean, people who are called &quot;MAGA&quot; in America actually WANT to limit social media for children and WANT to force ID verification for some websites. Sounds like the opposite of what the OP is referring to?

So what about not allowing kids to drink or smoke or drive?  Is that fascist as well?

Someone who legally purchases those products and then provides them to a minor is guilty of a crime just about anywhere in the USA.

Bzzzt, no. Even North Carolina, probably the most pro-tobacco state of all, has this to say in G.S. 14313:(c) If any person under the age of 18 years purchases or accepts receipt, or attempts to purchase or accept receipt, of tobacco products
or cigarette wrapping papers [...] shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor; 

(d) ... or if any person shall aid or abet a person who is less than 18 years of
age in purchasing, acquiring, or receiving or attempting to purchase, acquire, or receive tobacco
products or cigarette wrapping papers, the person shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor;

That&#39;s because it is impossible to enforce in homes.  They can&#39;t gamble on an online site even if they are at home.

According to copilot, that is the case in 32 states.  It is technically legal for them to possess at home in 18 states.  I&#39;m sure a good portion of those are red.  Conservatives even hate laws when they prevent children from poisoning their bodies.

With so many in power acting in bad faith, it&#39;s easy to forget that there actually are children, people are taking advantage of them, and that they should be protected.

Tech is deathly afraid at the thought they might not be able to hook kids before they hit puberty anymore. They may actually learn to live and think independently of the tech platforms. This strikes at the very core of their power in society.

Sounds like a win, the kids will have more time to do shit kids should do - like swim with the crocodiles, box with the kangaroos, kill feral cats, save koalas from the fires and milk spider venom.

No Mad Max is coming from behind the computer or the fondle slab, and his time is almost here.

5 million accounts is significant in a country of 28 Million inhabitants. There aren&#39;t that many social media networks.

I guess Australian teenagers haven&#39;t learned to lie about their age yet when they open an account. I for one always lie about my birth date when I open an account.

This could ultimately lead to new types of social media like peer to peer solutions or going back to things like the old SMS text messages for interactions between teenagers.

I suspect that the cure of not having access to social media is not a cure at all but a curse and cause some kids to get even more isolated. There are kids that even though they have a lot of neighbors don&#39;t fit in with them while they can find similarly minded online.

In America, they&#39;re trying to add legislation to limit what VPN providers can do in order to prevent spoofing. I bet Australia will too. So... VPNs are probably going to be a lot less useful in the future as well.

Their requirement is a symbol of a fundamentally broken security model, one that assumes that corporate LANs are trustworthy.

IBM had the right of this 30 years ago: when visitors came to the IBM offices they were shocked to find that the conference rooms all had Ethernet (and Token Ring -- this was IBM 30 years ago) ports in the tables that anyone could use and dropped them right onto IBM&#39;s corporate LAN.

The problem with that is that it isn&#39;t practical at all. It breaks every kind of business I can think of, and will never pass nationally because of it.

Nah.  Businesses don&#39;t generally use commercial VPN services (NetVPN, et al), they run their own servers.  So if they can regulate commercial VPN offerings it will mostly shut down consumer use for region-shifting, but won&#39;t affect businesses.  Actually restricting commercial VPN offerings is non-trivial, of course, and will always be somewhat leaky, but they can probably prevent VPNs from being usable by most consumers if they try.

Also, businesses really should wise up and stop using VPNs.  Their requirement is a symbol of a fundamentally broken security model, one that assumes that corporate LANs are trustworthy.

IBM had the right of this 30 years ago: when visitors came to the IBM offices they were shocked to find that the conference rooms all had Ethernet (and Token Ring -- this was IBM 30 years ago) ports in the tables that anyone could use and dropped them right onto IBM&#39;s corporate LAN.  IBM corporate security realized that no

Sources seem to indicate that Tor usage has increased exponentially in Australia, as well as many United States states, predominately southern ones and Utah. VPN services not located in the United States, the United Kingdom, or Australia are also expecting windfall profits in 2026. Torrent-based media piracy through Tor and VPNs is already spiking.Cite?

Many people and especially young people have *real* online friends and removing those social connections could produce feelings of isolation and likely depression. I think it would have been far better to regulate the sort of content that young people could access without isolating them socially.   Its easy to say that they should &quot;go out and make real friends&quot; but that is very difficult for some people.

Living sober is very difficult for some people, that doesn&#39;t mean the solution is to start pouring shots for the rest of the kids. Regardless of the fact that they might make friends while taking those shots.

Next...I hope they ban people over the age of 70 from driving.

I don&#39;t give a shit what condition they&#39;re in. Once they hit seventy...off the roads.

Install radials and disc brakes and you make up a lot of the safety gap between a 70 year old car and a modern one.

What&#39;s the problem, that&#39;s the choice of the &quot;oldest democracy in the world&quot;, the only democracy in history that freely chose a putinist, dictatorial regime. Twice.

Even the ruzzkies fought it for 20 years, you yielded in one.

You will have to learn from experience that elections really have consequences.

I didn&#39;t say only the new king of trumpistan is a complete moron, I explicitly pointed out that his followers and those who skip voting and relax and enjoy the dictatorship are also complete idiots.

The democratic party has been taken over by people who are a shame to our democratic partyIt&#39;s going to be reality stars and Youtube heroes winning in elections for both parties in the near future, because that&#39;s the level of voter we have now. 
Don&#39;t tell me about your foreign policy knowledge, how many likes did you get on the Youtube video?

You mean, the couldn&#39;t stomach a sane government run by rational people?

I have no idea what any of this means, or has to do with Harris or Walz.

by &quot;true cancer risk&quot; they mean &quot;has not killed enough true scotsmen (yet)&quot;

Our court will protect the rich interests of Bayer, because they only work for the rich.  Bayer doesn&#39;t want to have to fight 50 potential lawsuits in 50 states; that&#39;s too many election fund donations they&#39;d have to make.  Much cheaper to just pay off the feds to make the ruling for everyone.

The Party of States Rights [*] will make sure that Federal rules override the state rights.

I have not seen similar labelling in Europe so one wonders if this is a product of a lack of socialized health care. You don&#39;t have insurance or it has large gaps in coverage so you sue anyone you can with deep pockets to cover your health care bills  Meanwhile in the civilised world catching cancer is not going to bankrupt you with medical bills so there is no need to sue someone to pay them.Given the precautionary principal Europe operates on and the strong consumer protections if there was good evidence it caused cancer it would be banned by now.

Is the mix to increase potency or is it for apparent potency.

Don&#39;t know about farming, but the homeowner squirts glyphosate and nothing happens whereas Roundup causes the weeds to turn brown right away.

Is this about effectiveness or is it about lack of patience for the glyphosate to kick in.

The commercial version of &quot;Roundup&quot; is different from the consumer version.  The cancer is caused by the commercial version, allegedly.

There&#39;s a pretty serious deficiency in how pesticides are regulated in the commercial and agricultural realm.  Adjuvants and surfactants are very important and common parts of pesticide formulation but have virtually no regulation and no toxicity or health testing.  They are completely proprietary and closely guarded secrets.  I feel that much of the alleged links between pesticide use and cancer come from these adjuvants and surfactants.  And there are many other chemicals that are part of the formulation

Yes glyphosate is a very slow chemical. At certain times of the year it can take up to two weeks or more to kill weeds.  Farmers know this, but your average home owner doesn&#39;t, so Monsanto and Bayer introduced other herbicides into the Round-Up brand, sometimes in conjunction with glyphosate, some times without glyphosate..  These include quick-acting contact herbicides such as Diquat.  Diquat works in hours.  I think it&#39;s kind of bonkers they put diquat in a consumer product.

In the bad old days, industry would just dump its toxic trash in the next river. Obviously, the orange felon and his cronies think that was just a really neat solution.

This case is about a legal dispute. Do federal regulatory laws shield Monsanto from being sued under state laws for failing to warn consumers?

My $0.02 is it does cause cancer. But that&#39;s not what this case is about.

But that&#39;s not what this case is about.It seems, to my non lawyer view, the question is if the EPA establish label requirements, are states precluded from adding additional requirements via state laws? I would think, as a states rights issue, unless Federal laws specifically prohibited it they should be free to add requirements.  SCOTUS may feel otherwise.

With regards to this particular case, I won&#39;t pretend to understand the details enough to offer an opinion as to what constitutes a reasonable outcome. I&#39;m at great risk of committing a logical fallacy by jumping to one based of the reasonably defensible belief that &quot;Monsanto is evil&quot;.

What I would like to point out, as an external observer, is that it was only a few years ago when the image of the Supreme Court was mostly neutral at worst, and often pretty good. This wasn&#39;t just true for American citizens..

Regardless of the fact that 3 of those 6 justices are usually wildcards on any issueAs a hasty breakdown, three of the supreme court judges are liberal, and tend toward a liberal interpretation of the law; three of the judges are Trumpists, and will vote with whatever Trump wants every time, and three are conventional conservatives, and will go with the conservative interpretation of the law, which may not always be the Trump interpretation.

As a hasty breakdown, three of the supreme court judges are liberal, and tend toward a liberal interpretation of the law; three of the judges are Trumpists, and will vote with whatever Trump wants every time, and three are conventional conservatives, and will go with the conservative interpretation of the law, which may not always be the Trump interpretation.

There are no &quot;Trumpists&quot;.  Whenever the justices have broken against Trump, it&#39;s usually been, in addition to John Roberts - Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh.  Gorsuch has been split on it - sometimes joining them, while sometimes voting alongside Thomas and Alito.  The latter 2 are usually on the same page as Trump, but they were both appointed by the Bushes, so can&#39;t be called &quot;Trumpists&quot;.

As for the Libs on SCOTUS, Kagan has sometimes surprised us, and there was one occasion when even the justice w

Yoiu&#39;re right we should criticize accurately and with tangible facts:

Fact A: Gorsuch, even though I think he&#39;s at least a considerate judge who writes very well, is sitting in a stolen seat.Fact B: Alito is, as you agree, a naked partisan.  Some of his writings like Roe case are fuckin wiiiild and without precendent.Fact C: Thomas is likely guilty of bribery if the SC had any sort of ethics enforcement, oh and is a naked partisan.Fact D: Barret, who gain is in my opinion is also an alright judge, also sitti

A:  There is no such thing as a &quot;stolen seat&quot;.  There is nothing to suggest that the Dems wouldn&#39;t have done what McConnell did, and Merrick Garland was such a horrible AG that it&#39;s fortuitous that he didn&#39;t get to SCOTUS

B:  Alito never ruled on Roe: he wasn&#39;t in SCOTUS then.  Learn the difference b/w Roe and Dobbs

C:  The friend whose favors Thomas accepted never had any cases that went before SCOTUS, so that bribery question never arose

D:  Libs are just pissed that the Ginsburg didn&#39;t voluntarily resign wh

A: Sure there is, Garland should have been sat and voted on, full stop.  Your defense here of &quot;dems would also lol&quot; is irrelvant and nothing.  Also Garland wasn&#39;t AG at that time, time moves in one direction.  Also be was supported bipartisanly, that&#39;s why Obama picked him and why McConnel didn&#39;t vote, he would have been seated!

C: I didn&#39;t say Harland Crow was inside a case, you know we&#39;re talking about bigger things here right? Again, this is pedantry.

B.  No, completely different cases.  Not pedantry: just ignorance on your part

C.  No, there were no bigger things here.  If a judge was presiding over a case where a conflict-of-interests issue would have existed, the expectation would have been for him/her to recuse.  That wasn&#39;t the case here, so there was no &quot;bribery&quot;.  Justices can&#39;t be expected to take favors from nobody just b&#39;cos anybody might some day be before his court.  If that event occurs, they&#39;re expected to recuse

B: its pedantry because you know what I meant but you&#39;re making that the point of contention and not what Alito wrote in his ruling which his shoddy legal reasoning is what Im calling our and you know that, you said you know that.

C: &quot;If a judge was presiding over a case where a conflict-of-interests issue would have existed, the expectation would have been for him/her to recuse. &quot; The fact you say that means you have no grasp over the concern or what he has actually done. Should they be required to disclose

B.  Again, insisting that you have your facts i.e. the cases right is not pedantry, it&#39;s accuracy

C.  Judges can accept any gifts they like.  It&#39;s only an issue when the gift donor then goes on to be in front of them in court, in which case the conflict issues arise

E.  The beef that most Libs have w/ the court is that it ostensibly has a conservative majority.  In fact, that should not matter, since judges are supposed to interpret the law, not make it up as they go along: that&#39;s a part of the Article 1 bran

Regardless of the decision, I doubt that the companies that are doing those projects will rush in to resume operations, and sink more money into them before a final decision is made on this, either by this court, or by higher courts should the government decide to appeal.  Granted, Dominion has a captive market when it comes to providing electricity to the state (for gas, people can pick their suppliers), but I&#39;d be surprised if they chose to risk losing money on a project whose termination may finally be w

I’m curious about how this 660,000 figure was calculated. 2.6GW would be just about 4kW of capacity per home for 660,000 homes. But these calculations are normally done on the basis of sustained annual average draw. For the US, that is more like 1.2 to 1.5kW, a truly insane number (the UK average is 0.4, ie 400W, and in China it’s more like 2 to 300W). But even at 1.5kW, that wind farm could deliver enough capacity for 1.7m homes, not 660k.

I think, for some dumb reasons the calculation is being done off the average peak load. But that is more like 5kW than 4kW, so that figure is wrong.

It would really make more sense to do the calculation on the basis of expected annual generation divided by annual average US household consumption, which heads off all the nonsense about nameplate capacity. That would be 9.5bn kWh divided by 10,800kWh, so about 880,000 homes.

Maybe they are using electricity for heating, and its winter at the moment. They might also have an EV

I think it&#39;s reasonable to estimate it by peak load. You simply can&#39;t count on higher figures knowing you&#39;ll eventually and certainly fall short.

Otherwise, if you say you could provide energy to millions of homes, what would you do when it&#39;s peak season and more than half of them suddenly lose power?

1) Maybe the statement of 660,000 homes is already considering and deducting commercial and industrial use.2) One solution would be of course to say &quot;at least 660,000 homes&quot; or &quot;from 660,000 up to 1.7 milli

Your scenario makes sense for an isolated system, where there were a bunch of homes whose electricity was exclusively supplied by this single wind farm. But obviously, that&#39;s not the case: it&#39;s part of a system of heterogenous supply, so this is just a theoretical and indicative calculation the operator or media have used to give people a sense of the scale of this project compared to others / the scale of the US as a whole. And that&#39;s where I&#39;m puzzled, I can&#39;t see how they got to their indicative figure.

The US is going down the drains, with the voters increasingly ignored and the politicians asleep. Might not be a good idea to build anything there now.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

President Trump REALLY wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. He’s fallen hard for this 200-year-old law that would allow him to deploy active duty military to enforce civilian law on American streets. On this week’s Amicus podcast, co-host Mark Joseph Stern is joined by Professor Steve Vladeck, a nationally recognized expert on the Supreme Court, federal courts, national security law, and military justice. They discuss what’s been stopping Trump from invoking the act so far, why he has no legal authority to do so right now, and what happens if he does it anyway.

Next, Mark talks to Julia Gegenheimer, former special litigation counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, and now a special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Julia and Mark discuss the remaining paths to justice after the killing of Renee Good and examine what happens when the DOJ abandons its duty to seek accountability and vindicate civil rights.

Three days ago, Slate published an article I wrote titled “You’ve Heard About Who ICE Is Recruiting. The Truth Is Far Worse. I’m the Proof.” The article details how I, in an effort to learn more about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s hiring practices, applied for a job at ICE—and ended up getting a job offer. To say that I was surprised would be an understatement: For one, I’m a vocal online critic of ICE and the Trump administration. More saliently, I skipped many of the steps required for the application. It’s a wild story—I’d encourage you to read the whole thing—and one that does not reflect particularly well on ICE or its parent organization: the Department of Homeland Security.

In another time, the exposé of an extraordinarily lax hiring process at an agency tasked with keeping the nation safe would be of bipartisan concern. After all, if ICE is going to arm agents and send them out into America’s streets, it should at least know whom it’s sending. Even supporters of ICE’s mission should want to know that the agency is hiring effective people to carry that mission out. And so under another administration, DHS might look into what happened here, figuring out how my application went through and whether it was a one-off glitch or a widespread, systemic issue.

This administration, however, took a different approach. “This is such a lazy lie. This individual was NEVER offered a job at ICE,” DHS said Wednesday through the administration’s most official communication channel: X (formerly Twitter). “Applicants may receive a Tentative Selection Letter following their initial application and interview that is not a job offer. It just means they are invited to submit information for review, similar to any other applicant.”

DHS is correct that I received an initial offer letter. I also, however, received a final offer, as well as an EOD (Entrance On Duty) date of Sept. 30, according to the application portal. The application listed my medical screening and background check as complete, despite me never filling out paperwork for either. Perhaps, had I pressed “Accept” and moved on with the process, they would have caught the glitch, performed the background check, and demanded those papers. But according to ICE’s own application portal, I was offered a job. (I asked ICE’s media department about all of this before publishing my article, but they did not respond.)

I took a screengrab video of my application status on the ICE portal as of Oct. 3, which you can view below.

There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. The dashboard at the beginning of this video provides an overview of my application process for the position of deportation officer. My tentative offer is marked “Sent,” which—as the mouseover demonstrates—means that I did not acknowledge or accept the offer. The Pre-Employment activities section is marked TBD, which makes sense, since I did not complete any of the pre-employment paperwork. And yet, my final offer status reads “accepted” which, according to the mouseover, means “you accepted the Final Offer and your Entry On Duty date (EOD) date has been set.” And indeed, my onboarding status is EOD: “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

The point here is that the video of ICE’s own portal confirms my story: The agency offered me a job and gave me a start date without, by its own admission, meeting its own standards for vetting.

Later on, you can see the pre-employment part of the portal that claims my medical and background checks are already complete. If this background check occurred without my participation or knowledge, it missed some massive red flags. I did not mention this in the original article, but Jedeed is a Syrian name: My father immigrated in the 1970s. This fact delayed my military clearance by several months back in 2005. Why, if this background check really happened, did no one think to ask about a possible connection to Syria this time around?

I uploaded the video to X in response to DHS’ “lazy lie” accusation, along with the text “You sure about that?” Seven million impressions, over 100,000 likes, and zero response from the Department of Homeland Security. To be fair, they have their hands full right now; they are very busy brutalizing and detaining people as they attempt to go to doctor’s appointments, throwing flash-bang grenades into cars full of children, and terrorizing the residents of a major American city.

DHS’ response is noteworthy because it comes at a moment when the department is demanding the public’s trust. It’s demanding that we believe that the ICE officer who killed Renee Good was in danger (despite contradictory video evidence), and that he left the event badly injured. More broadly, it’s demanding we believe that ICE agents are doing their work under siege, and that they’re the victims of agression—rather than the perpetrators of it. There are already plenty of reason to be deeply skeptical of any and all of that, but add this to the list: If DHS will lie so brazenly about this story, why would we believe anything else the department’s mouthpieces have to say?

Which brings me to the larger point of Tuesday’s article. We are not simply dealing with a broken hiring system or a lack of training within ICE’s ranks. This sloppy application process, and the DHS’ apathetic, angry response, are just two symptoms of a systemic disregard for the lives and safety of American residents—citizens and noncitizens alike.

The presence of an armed, masked, and improperly vetted force with no oversight and “absolute immunity” (not in a legal sense, but in the sense that the Trump administration’s DOJ will not prosecute them) should concern everyone in the country. What we are dealing with, in Minneapolis and across this nation, is an emergency—and no amount of DHS propaganda can make it go away.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act on Thursday to quell protests against the federal occupation of the Twin Cities, a move that would allow him to send in the military over Minnesota’s opposition. Masked immigration officers are currently rampaging through Minneapolis and St. Paul, brutalizing protesters and arresting individuals on the basis of race, drawing widespread opposition from local leaders and communities. The president evidently believes that he can wield the Insurrection Act to suppress their First Amendment rights and impose a kind of military rule on the streets.

But what exactly is this law—and why hasn’t Trump deployed it already? To explain what the Insurrection Act truly authorizes and the risks that come with invoking it, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck on this week’s episode of Amicus. Vladeck is an expert on military law and author of the One First Substack. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: Let’s start with the absolute basics: What is the Insurrection Act?

Steve Vladeck: The Insurrection Act is the common—if misleading—name that we’ve given to a series of statutes that trace all the way back to 1792. These statutes carry into force Congress’ constitutional power to provide for the “calling forth of the militia”—and then later, the military—to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or “execute the laws of the Union.” The idea was that Congress should be able to allow the president, in very narrow but important circumstances, to use military force as a backup when civilian order and civilian law enforcement has broken down.

So the idea was that it would be used in narrow circumstances, but the language is actually fairly broad. How have presidents invoked it in the past? It seems like, for the most part, they’ve actually been pretty restrained and not used it the way Trump wants to use it.

The history of the Insurrection Act is of pretty responsible usage of a statute that could be interpreted, in a vacuum, as a remarkably broad delegation of power to the president. We’ve had somewhere around 30 invocations of the statute across American history. But the last one was 34 years ago when President George H.W. Bush used it to help send troops in during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

Although those 30 invocations might have been politically controversial in some cases, they weren’t legally controversial. When President Kennedy sent troops into Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith and the 300 law enforcement officers who were there with him, that was politically controversial because the South didn’t want them. It was not legally controversial because those guys were at perilous risk of being lynched. And Mississippi’s local and state authorities were not exactly helping. So presidents have been responsible historically; they’ve usually had compelling factual bases for invoking the Insurrection Act. It hasn’t been used as a permanent way to deploy troops into our cities. Even the Justice Department, which is not shy about claiming power for the president, has taken a very narrow view of when they can use it.

It sounds like you don’t think that the protests in the Twin Cities right now actually give Trump legitimate grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act.

I don’t think it’s even close. But there is a problem of folks coming to this history fresh, who don’t know the backstory or the historical pedigree here. Because you could read the statute and say: If I squint a little, one protester throwing a rock at an ICE officer is impeding law enforcement. But the Insurrection Act is not about private conduct. It is really about circumstances where the states themselves are unwilling or unable to enforce their laws, or where they’re specifically thwarting federal law enforcement.

Every time the Trump administration points to an example of something bad happening to an ICE officer, the culprits are protesters, not state officials. President Trump can mouth off about the mayor and the governor, but he doesn’t have any specific examples of policies or episodes where state and local governments have been the reasons why ICE has been impeded. If it were otherwise—if one person doing one thing to impede an ICE officer from carrying out their duties was sufficient to justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act—then all protests would trigger the Insurrection Act. And that’s not how we’ve ever understood the Insurrection Act. It would not make any sense with First Amendment values.

Why hasn’t Trump invoked the Insurrection Act yet?

I think there are two reasons. One is political and one is legal. The political reason is that there really still are political obstacles to invoking the Insurrection Act. The president would invite blowback, even from some members of the Republican caucus and Congress. Not many, but given how razor-thin the Republicans’ margin is in the House right now, it wouldn’t take that many votes to really upend all of this.

Then the legal part is that the administration will be sued, and there are probably some folks who are wary that the facts, as they currently stand, make it at least somewhat questionable whether they will win that case. As opposed to a scenario where there’s a more visible unprovoked assault on an ICE officer, or a state official who is directly involved in impeding ICE. I think that might be the pretext they’re looking for.

That’s, of course, my next question: If Trump invokes the law, there will be a legal challenge, and it will go to the Supreme Court. What will that challenge look like, and do you really think it’ll have a chance of prevailing at SCOTUS? Is there also a chance that justices could say they just don’t have authority to overrule the commander-in-chief on this?

I don’t think the court will go quite that far. What I worry about more is a ruling that says that the president’s entitled to a whole lot of deference, not that the courts are powerless. I don’t think John Roberts is going to join an opinion that says the court is powerless about anything. But I do worry about the fight over the facts. In the National Guard cases, the lower courts made a series of factual findings that are inconsistent with what the executive branch said was the factual basis for deploying the troops. Do the courts have the power to do that? That will be the fight.

This is why I think the facts actually are going to matter. If and when the president invokes the Insurrection Act, will there be more of a factual basis than there is here on Friday morning? Does the district court make factual findings that are actually well-supported by the record and would be difficult for the Supreme Court to run away from? The devil’s going to be in the details.

It sounds like you think six of the justices really don’t want to call Donald Trump a liar. But to block the use of the Insurrection Act in the Twin Cities, the Supreme Court would probably have to say that Trump, executive branch officials, and law enforcement officers are not telling the truth. And the court is clearly hesitant to do that.

I could also imagine a universe in which even the factual claims made by the Trump administration, taken at face value, could be held insufficient. The only way the Supreme Court could rule against Trump without second-guessing him is an opinion that says: Even assuming all this is true, that’s still not enough for the Insurrection Act. I have no faith that Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch would join such an opinion. So we’re back to where we are so often in these cases, which is: Where are the chief and Justice Barrett?

I don’t know. I’m heartened about what happened in the National Guard case, which is a sign that they do not just reflexively rule for the Trump administration. But it’s going to depend on just how divorced from reality the administration’s factual arguments are. This is why I think they’ve been waiting for something more than the Renee Good incident, for something more than a couple of suspects resisting an ICE arrest. I think they’re waiting for something that they can pitch plausibly as a completely unprovoked act of violence, or interference by a local or state law enforcement officer.

People often say that Trump does whatever he wants and doesn’t listen to his lawyers, but I don’t think that’s true when it comes to stuff that could reach the Supreme Court. I think he is very cautious when dealing with any issue that’s going to go to the justices.

One hundred percent. There’s a reason why they haven’t invoked the Insurrection Act as we’re sitting here today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hundreds of millions of wireless earbuds, headphones, and speakers are vulnerable to silent hijacking due to a flaw in Google&#39;s Fast Pair system that allows attackers to seize control without the owner ever touching the pairing button.

The issue, dubbed &quot;WhisperPair,&quot; was uncovered by researchers at KU Leuven, who found that many Bluetooth accessories claiming support for Fast Pair fail to properly enforce one of its most basic safety checks. Based on Fast Pair&#39;s uptake, the team says the flaw likely affects &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of accessories already in circulation.

In theory, Fast Pair devices are supposed to accept new pairing requests only when the user explicitly places them in pairing mode. In practice, the researchers say, many products will happily accept a new connection request at any time.

That creates an opening for attackers within Bluetooth range to step in and pair their own device, even if the accessory is already in use by someone else.

Once paired, the attacker gets the same level of access as a legitimate owner. Depending on the device, that can mean injecting or interrupting audio, manipulating volume, or, in some cases, activating the microphone. It is the sort of pesky thing that does not require nation-state resources or exotic hardware; a nearby phone or laptop is more than enough.

The researchers stress the problem is not Bluetooth itself, but sloppy or incomplete implementations of Google&#39;s Fast Pair specification by device makers. Fast Pair was designed to make connecting accessories to Android devices nearly frictionless, using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and cloud lookups to speed things along. That convenience has come at the cost of enforcement on the accessory side, where vendors are expected to check whether pairing should even be allowed in the first place.

What&#39;s more, some Fast Pair accessories integrate with Google&#39;s Find My Device network, allowing lost earbuds or headphones to be located using nearby Android phones. If an attacker can pair with an accessory before its rightful owner does, they can potentially register it to their account and receive location updates as it moves around.

Google was alerted to the issue and says it has been working with manufacturers on fixes. Some patches are now trickling out as firmware updates, though coverage is patchy, and plenty of cheaper accessories either don&#39;t get updates at all or rely on clunky vendor apps most users never open.

Tweaking settings on your phone, or switching Fast Pair off entirely, doesn&#39;t solve much if the accessory itself is still happy to accept rogue pairing requests.

The WhisperPair team reported the bug privately last year and sat on the details while vendors were given time to respond, picking up a bug bounty along the way. Their findings are a good example of a recurring problem in the smart device world: security rules that look fine on paper can unravel quickly once they&#39;re handed to dozens of manufacturers racing to ship cheap hardware. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! UK water company Severn Trent learned an unfortunate lesson about text-to-speech systems when a robocall to customers went hilariously wrong.

A Reg reader received an automated call warning of potential water discoloration during planned works from January 19-25. The message advised running taps for twenty minutes if the water appeared discolored - standard stuff, if a bit robotic.

In the recording forwarded to us, a female voice told our reader what to expect. All good, if a little robotic.

However, things went off the rails a bit when the robot attempted to read out the URL for Severn Trent: http://www.stwater.co.uk/discolouration.

For anyone concerned, the URL redirects to a secure connection.

The robot took a run at it, but the result was unlikely to be what the water company wanted. We imagine Severn Trent was hoping for &quot;S T Water,&quot; but instead got &quot;S Twatter.&quot;

Text-to-speech blunders are nothing new. This writer has fond memories of home computers with primitive speech synthesizers producing similar gaffes to the horror of listening parents, and later validating Interactive Voice Response Systems (IVRS) to spare customers confusion and embarrassment.

Decades later, and in an era where Artificial Intelligence should be navigate linguistic landmines, it&#39;s almost reassuring that blindly feeding text into a system without human verification can still produce unintended results.

Unless Severn Trent, a UK water company, is about to undergo a rebrand, and the robot has inadvertently blabbed. Calling yourself S Twatter, however, would be a very brave move, particularly in the UK.

Someone should probably add a quality check to that robocall system. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI&#39;s budget ChatGPT Go subscription tier has migrated to the US, soon to be accompanied by advertising. The company&#39;s free tier will be similarly afflicted.

ChatGPT Go, the company&#39;s cheapest paid offering, has been an option in 171 countries since August and is now available stateside for $8 per month.

&quot;In the coming weeks, we&#39;re also planning to start testing ads in the US for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay,&quot; said Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#39;s CEO of applications. &quot;Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.&quot;

About 5 percent, or 35 million, of ChatGPT&#39;s weekly active user base as of July 2025 paid for Plus ($20/month) or Pro ($200/month) subscriptions, according to The Information. The company reportedly projects that by 2030 about 8.5 percent of a weekly active user base of roughly 2.6 billion - around 220 million people - will pay for a Plus subscription. With so many non-paying customers, ads may be its only route to financial survival. (That or a government bailout, which the company says won&#39;t happen.)

OpenAI has reportedly committed to spend more than $1 trillion to fuel its quest for the vaguely defined idea of &quot;artificial general intelligence.&quot; The AI giant lost north of $11.5 billion in the third quarter alone, according to numbers Microsoft – a large OpenAI investor – disclosed in its financial filings.

Meanwhile, online advertising is a massive business, contributing more than $74 billion to Google&#39;s revenues and more than $50 billion to Meta&#39;s revenues in the third quarter of 2025 alone. And chatbots like ChatGPT are technically capable of capturing a massive amount of extremely personal data, given that people use them for everything from vibe coding to online companionship to informal therapy.

Simo acknowledged the need to preserve people&#39;s trust in ChatGPT – to the extent that people trust LLMs known for making things up and getting things wrong – and made a number of vague commitments to offer reassurance that their artificial intelligence agent wouldn&#39;t become a mercenary sales agent.

This included a reiteration of the claim that the company&#39;s pursuit of advertising aligns with its mission to ensure AGI – a moving target based on some determination of human intellectual equivalency – &quot;benefits all of humanity.&quot;

Ads, Simo promised, will not influence the answers provided by ChatGPT, will be &quot;optimized based on what&#39;s most helpful to you,&quot; as Simo put it, and will be distinct and clearly labelled.

ChatGPT users under 18, and queries about sensitive topics like health or politics, will be spared from ads, or so it&#39;s claimed.

&quot;We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers,&quot; Simo said, adding that users will have the ability to control how their data is used and to disable personalization.

&quot;Selling data&quot; can mean different things in different contexts, but may be disallowed if consent is lacking, depending on the relevant privacy rules. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), it can mean &quot;selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer&#39;s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.&quot;

Google and Meta have both insisted they don&#39;t sell personal data, but they certainly use it to target their own ads, and their decades of privacy missteps attest to the relevance of those claims.

Miranda Bogen, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology&#39;s AI Governance Lab, argues that even in the absence of data sharing, ad targeting can harm privacy. OpenAI&#39;s shift toward advertising presents risks for the company and its customers, she said.

&quot;Even if AI platforms don&#39;t share data directly with advertisers, business models based on targeted advertising put really dangerous incentives in place when it comes to user privacy,&quot; said Bogen in an emailed statement. &quot;This decision raises real questions about how business models will shape AI in the long run.&quot;

Bogen said that people use chatbots for a variety of reasons, including as companions and advisors. She argues that when tools try to exploit trust to sell goods, that may be problematic.

&quot;AI companies should be extremely careful not to repeat the many mistakes that have been made — and harms that have resulted from — the adoption of personalized ads on social media and around the web,&quot; she said.

Meta has integrated AI into its advertising business and uses AI-generated images in ads. But efforts by chatbot maker Perplexity to present ads in conjunction with its AI search service have fallen flat. Perplexity paused accepting new ad clients in October last year, following the departure of its head of advertising.

Lower-tier ChatGPT users who haven&#39;t bought their way out of advertising may still have some say in whether they see ads. Several makers of ad blocking applications and extensions already claim their tools can block ads that appear in ChatGPT. That may hold true when ChatGPT is accessed from the browser but is likely to be less feasible in OpenAI&#39;s native desktop apps. The possibilities will become clearer once OpenAI starts serving ads. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/17/trump_wants_big_tech_pay_power_plants/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration says it wants big tech companies to take more accountability for the power their datacenters consume in an effort to shield voters from higher power bills at home.

On Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior Secretary (and former Microsoft exec) Doug Burgum met with mid-Atlantic governors to pressure PJM Interconnection - one of the largest grid operators in the country - to hold an emergency auction to address rising energy demand from AI datacenter developments to the tune of $15 billion.

PJM is home to the largest concentration of datacenters in the US. Many new bit barns now exceed 100 megawatts of power capacity, with the likes of OpenAI and Meta already eyeing multi-gigawatt campuses.

These buildouts have sparked fears of higher power bills for local residents, something that hasn&#39;t sat well with politicians on either side of the aisle.

Last month, a trio of Democratic senators launched a probe into why consumers were seeing higher rates despite datacenter operators&#39; claims otherwise.

Rising energy prices haven&#39;t been popular with the US president either. On Monday, Trump used his personal echo chamber Truth Social to declare &quot;I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of datacenters.&quot;

The initiative launched on Friday seeks to secure new baseload power generation, with US tech titans putting up the cash for 15-year contracts.

The DoE argues such an auction is justified after PJM&#39;s decision to take 17 gigawatts of capacity offline between 2020 and 2025. Much of the capacity which was already retired or slated for retirement was produced by coal-fired steam generators, for which Trump has shown a particular affinity.

&quot;In the coming years, America&#39;s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,&quot; an Energy.gov fact sheet reads. &quot;The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.&quot;

In response to the Trump administration&#39;s demands, PJM&#39;s board of managers released a plan Friday directing the grid operator&#39;s staff to &quot;develop a proposal to both accelerate and execute&quot; a backstop procurement to supplement the company&#39;s last capacity auction.

The idea of datacenters bringing their own power has gained momentum in recent months, as operators have grappled with both long-term and immediate energy demands.

These efforts have included commissioning new gas generator plants along with portable generators to serve as stopgaps. Meanwhile, hyperscalers have placed bets on nuclear power startups like Oklo or X-Energy to satisfy their long-term power demands.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft formalized its commitments to &quot;pay its way&quot; to ensure local utility customers didn&#39;t end up footing the bill.

In spite of these initiatives, supply chain challenges continue to dog operators. Gas generators offer an easy path to addressing demand, but the equipment necessary to build and deploy them is locked up, with waitlists stretching out to 2030.

Meanwhile, even the most optimistic forecasts won&#39;t see the first commercial small modular reactors come online until the end of the decade.

Having said that, Microsoft has had some luck backing efforts to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the one that didn&#39;t partially melt down in the late &#39;70s. The reactor is set to resume operations later next year. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/axlerod_ai_saves_insurance_agents_time/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers at Dakota State University, in partnership with regional insurance carrier Safety Insurance, devised an experimental chatbot called &quot;Axlerod&quot; to assist independent insurance agents. Whether that assistance was substantial is up for some debate.

Based on testing described in a pre-print paper [PDF], &quot;Introducing Axlerod: An LLM-based Chatbot for Assisting Independent Insurance Agents,&quot; the chatbot can help auto insurance agents save time with certain information retrieval tasks.

The extent of that help and its value to insurance agents varies depending upon how much it&#39;s used and how much time is actually saved, underscoring the challenges businesses face when trying to implement AI systems.

The DSU researchers say that business-facing chatbots make more sense than consumer-facing ones because insurance agents, with their domain experience, are better suited to interpret subtle policy language and to spot hallucinations. And they argue AI technology can be consequential.

&quot;This study highlights the transformative role of artificial intelligence in the insurance industry, demonstrating how conversational agents such as Axlerod can enhance operational efficiency by assisting independent insurance agents with policy retrieval and workflow automation,&quot; state authors Adam Bradley, John Hastings, and Khandaker Mamun Ahmed.

&quot;Transformative,&quot; in this instance, means saving insurance agents 2.42 seconds on average for search-oriented tasks including finding client policy numbers, determining AutoPay eligibility, identifying covered vehicles, and determining the billing plan.

Axlerod consists of a lightweight wrapper around Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and some tools. It&#39;s a system prompt that describes how Gemini should behave. Gemini is linked to Safety Insurance&#39;s internal data sources through a middleware layer called LiteLLM that acts as a proxy to translate API requests using OpenAI&#39;s standard to Google&#39;s API and handle Vertex AI authentication. The chatbot also relies on a microframework for creating agentic applications dubbed &quot;Smoltalk.&quot;

&quot;With the help of Axlerod, human agents perform their task significantly faster comparing [sic] with the traditional way,&quot; the paper explains. &quot;On average, without the chatbot a human agent takes 7.55 seconds where with chatbot the agent takes 5.13 seconds, and the 2.42 seconds faster search time would play a significant role in serving a large number of customers. With more complex tasks, where a user would need to navigate multiple screens or search for a user by name, Axlerod is notably faster.&quot;

Each chatbot inquiry costs on average $0.0075, according to the authors, who note that the cost can be discounted to account for the efficiency improvement of agents.

Whether the return on investment pans out depends on the usage scenario. Assuming an average insurance agent salary of $80,000, that translates to per-second pay of roughly $0.01, given 250 8-hour work days per year. With a savings of 2.42 seconds repeated 20 times per day, that&#39;s 48.4 seconds saved in one business day, or 12,100 seconds saved over 250 business days.

With 12,100 seconds priced at $0.01, that&#39;s a total annual savings of $121 in labor costs. However, let&#39;s consider that the employer isn&#39;t exactly going to get to deduct that $121 from the agent&#39;s annual pay, so it&#39;s $121 worth of extra time that may or may not turn into added productivity. It could just be another 48 seconds of drinking coffee each day.

A Google Gemini Business edition seat starts at $21 per month or $252 per year.

Khandaker Mamun Ahmed, a co-author of the paper and assistant professor at The Beacom College of Computer and Cyber Sciences at Dakota State University, told The Register in an email that AI technology has strong potential to transform insurance company operations.

&quot;As noted in the paper, the US property and casualty market includes 4,100+ carriers with combined revenues exceeding $1T,&quot; Ahmed explained. &quot;While we did not report a specific estimate for how many searches an agent might perform per day, agents routinely handle high daily activity volumes (often cited in the range of ~50–200 customer interactions per day). With an AI system built directly on the relevant data sources, the number of information lookups and searches could reasonably be much higher because the friction to retrieve answers is substantially reduced.&quot;

Using slightly different figures from The Register&#39;s inquiry, Ahmed said the ROI assuming 80 searches daily would be as follows:

Cost per Search: $0.0075

Daily Searches (10x/hr x 8 hrs): 80 searches

Total Daily Cost: 80 × $0.0075 = $0.60

Time Saved per Search: 2.42 seconds

Time Saved per Day: 193.6 seconds

Labor Value ($80k/yr, $0.01/sec): 2.42s × $0.01 = $0.0242 per search

Total Daily Savings: 80 × $0.0242 = $1.936

Net Daily Benefit: $1.936 (Savings) - $0.60 (Cost) = $1.336

Percentage: (Net Benefit/Cost) * 100=(1.336/0.60) *100 = 222% Daily ROI

The break-even point would be $0.0075/$0.0242 per search=0.31 searches, according to Ahmed.

Asked about how the study accounted for failures, Ahmed said, &quot;Our system achieved a high success rate, with an average of 93.18 percent. In addition, Axlerod is designed to proactively request clarifying input when an initial query returns more than five results, enabling users to refine and narrow the search space.

&quot;In practice, when refinement is needed, the interaction requires effort comparable to a standard lookup and is typically resolved through guided clarification rather than a separate correction workflow. Notably, we observed no failures during the testing period.&quot;

The Register spoke with Scott Johnson, of independent insurance brokerage Marindependent, to ask about how often he might make policy queries about basic data.

&quot;About 10 or 20 times a day,&quot; Johnson said, adding that he&#39;s interested in potential uses for AI but said the chatbots he&#39;d seen have limitations. He said that they often can&#39;t handle your question and miss common industry terms like requests for policy information or a declaration sheet.

Most independent agencies, he said, already rely on software like EZLynx that automates tasks like fetching insurance carrier data so it can be accessed on demand. That avoids maybe 80 percent of inquiries, he said, adding that when agents do have to reach out for information, questions tend to be complicated ones that chatbots wouldn&#39;t be able to answer.

Ahmed said, &quot;Overall, we believe the opportunities outweigh the obstacles, particularly for agent-facing deployments where humans remain in the loop to validate outputs in a high-stakes environment. That said, robust field testing is still essential. Expanded evaluation with practicing agents will be critical to validate real-world utility, assess agent trust, and measure efficiency across both human-in-the-loop and more automated workflows.&quot; ®

            <h2>Micron breaks ground on humungous NY DRAM fab after beating bats and tree huggers</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/micron_fab_breaks_ground/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Micron broke snowy winter ground in New York on Friday to begin building a chip fab that promises to bring up to 50,000 jobs and much-needed computer memory production to US shores, as the AI boom continues to push memory prices up.

The company’s stock surged on the news that shovels had been put to work on the facility first announced in 2022, which had been bedeviled by environmental delays.

The megafab - which would displace 500 acres of woods and wetlands, as well as two endangered species of bats - is scheduled to begin producing DRAM chips by 2030.

Micron said it will create 1,216 acres of off-site bat habitat including maternity roosts to mitigate the potential damage its fab will cause to the Indiana and northern long-eared bat populations, as well as 628 acres of land to offset impacts to the sedge wren, short-eared owl, and northern harrier bird populations.

Marking the largest private investment in New York state history, the $100 billion project will take 20 years to complete and will eventually bring four fabs, each spanning roughly 1.2 million square feet, to the 1,377-acre White Pine Commerce Park site in Clay, NY.

The global technology component supply chain is bracing for higher prices in 2026 amid an AI-driven chip famine that analysts at IDC told The Register could stretch into 2027 as production of memory gets pushed towards higher value AI infrastructure products and away from cheaper consumer goods.

While Micron’s first two fabs at the New York facility are set to come online in 2030, the others are not scheduled to be finished until 2041. The company claims the buildout would increase US-based DRAM production twelvefold over the next two decades.

Micron said the completed fabs will employ 9,000 workers in three shifts, 24 hours per day. The remaining 40,000 jobs that Micron touts will come over 20 years and include “suppliers, contractors, and other supporting roles.”

In April 2024, Micron won $6.1 billion in federal funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to help cover its fab expansion plans. That includes both the New York plant and an R&D facility in Boise, Idaho.

At the time it was announced, Micron planned for a 2024 groundbreaking. However, the project&#39;s scale triggered a US Army Corps of Engineers permitting process covering the permanent loss of 193.38 acres of federally regulated wetlands and 6,283 linear feet of streams and ditches.

In its October 2025 environmental analysis, Micron said that by 2030, it would have constructed 504.54 acres of wetlands, compared with 104.01 acres of wetlands impacted by Phase 1 construction activities. Micron also estimates that by the time the project is complete, greenhouse-gas sequestration from preserved and constructed wetlands would more than triple the losses associated with the full buildout of the campus. ®

Happy Saturday, folks! This week, Best Buy kicked off its so-called “Winter Sale,” introducing a whole host of price cuts that range from not-so-good to legitimately great, at least for this time of year. We’ll be publishing many of the highlights in a dedicated news post tomorrow, though, per usual, not all of this week’s best deals revolve around Best Buy. Apple’s M4 Mac Mini, for instance, is receiving a $100 discount at Amazon and B&H Photo, while LG’s 65-inch C5 OLED TV is on sale at eBay for a little over a grand. There are also steep savings to be had on 45W power banks, the Beats Fit Pro, and more, so let’s dive in.

If you want a Mac and your budget is less than $500, your only real option — aside from going the refurbished route or picking up a model that’s several generations old — is Apple’s latest Mac Mini. Thankfully, the desktop machine makes for a truly excellent daily driver, one that’s currently on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $499 ($100), which is just $20 shy of its Black Friday low and about $30 less than its best price to date.

For most people, the 2024 Mac Mini is a far better (and more economical) choice than the latest Mac Studio. The tiny, M4-powered machine is an excellent value, even at full price, with three Thunderbolt 4 (USB 4) ports, a gigabit ethernet jack, a 3.5mm audio input, and an HDMI port. Its 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU provide fast, consistent performance for a wide range of tasks; however, keep in mind that you’ll need to bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse.

Last year, we saw a spate of power bank recalls, including those from both Anker and ESR. I replaced one of my aging Anker models during that time with Iniu’s excellent Carry P51L-E2, which is on sale at Amazon for a new low of $18.86 (about $21 off) at checkout.

The 20,000mAh power bank isn’t particularly fancy, though it does output up to 45W of power and features a built-in, braided USB-C cable that doubles as a lanyard. You also get an extra USB-C and USB-A port, allowing you to juice your phone, tablet, a pair of wireless earbuds, and other small electronics at the same time. Now, if only Iniu could have packed the extra battery capacity into a charger as compact and colorful as the like-minded Pocket Rocket P50. C’est la vie.

Arguably the best TV deal you can find this weekend would be on the 65-inch Bravia 8 II, which is still hovering around $2,398 (over $1,000 off) at multiple retailers, including Amazon. But not everyone has that kind of money to throw around on an OLED panel, which makes the current discount on LG’s C5 more appealing. Now through January 20th, you can pick up LG’s 65-inch OLED TV at eBay for $1,197.59 ($1,502 off) when you use code FAVEFINDS20 at checkout.

Like prior models in the C Series, the C5 is all about value. The 4K set delivers the deep black levels and contrast for which OLEDs are known, and it features LG’s AI Picture Pro, which analyzes what you’re watching and adjusts brightness, resolution, and other settings to improve clarity. It also features a bevy of gaming-friendly features, including a 120Hz refresh rate, support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and four HDMI 2.1 ports, allowing you to play current-gen titles in 4K at up to 120fps. It’s rounded out with HDR10 and Dolby Vision support, further enhancing color and contrast.

Having now used both the Beats Fit Pro and the new Powerbeats Fit as part of my weekly workout regimen, I can tell you with absolute certainty that there’s little difference between the two — well, other than the fact that the Powerbeats Fit retail for $199.95 and the last-gen Beats Fit Pro are on sale at Woot in select colors for $89.99 ($110 off) through January 31st. Beats’ latest workout earbuds also feature a smaller charging case and more flexible wing tips, I guess, but with the Fit Pro, you’re still getting solid noise cancellation, good sound, and all the Apple ecosystem tricks you’d expect for less than half the price.

            <div id="article-text">﻿The new adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s sci-fi light novel feels like a tribute to the roguelike genre.

﻿The new adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s sci-fi light novel feels like a tribute to the roguelike genre.

While Hollywood has repeatedly tried adapting stories from Japanese manga, vanishingly few of them have been as good as Edge of Tomorrow — Warner Bros.’ 2014 live-action film based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s sci-fi light novel All You Need Is Kill. Edge of Tomorrow wasn’t a one-to-one translation of All You Need Is Kill’s original story or its manga adaptation by Takeshi Obata, Ryosuke Takeuchi, and Yoshitoshi Abe. The movie was more militaristic and focused on humanity rallying against an alien invasion.

But Edge of Tomorrow understood that what made its source material so powerful was its imaginative exploration of what it means to be tenacious in the face of insurmountable odds. That’s also true of Warner Bros. Japan and Studio 4°C’s new animated All You Need Is Kill adaptation directed by Kenichiro Akimoto. Like Edge of Tomorrow, this version of All You Need Is Kill reworks some major details in order to make its Groundhog Day-inspired story feel fresh. But the new feature is much stranger and more visually stunning than any of its forebears. And it’s a prime example of how much fun movies can be when they embrace the frustrating madness of video games.

Much like the All You Need Is Kill light novel, the new movie tells the story of two unlikely friends who find themselves stuck in a time loop after being murdered by an alien superorganism known as Darol. But this take on the mindbending story is told from the perspective of Rita Vrataski (Ai Mikami, Stephanie Sheh in the English dub), a disaffected young woman looking for purpose at a Darol research facility. Though everyone at the facility knows Darol — a towering creature that looks like an unbloomed flower — fell from space, no one has any idea that the alien is chockful of monsters waiting to devour anything that moves. And it isn’t until Darol blossoms that Rita learns firsthand how deadly the aliens truly are.

Even with her futuristic exoskeleton power armor, there’s little Rita can do to really defend herself when Darol first unleashes its skittering progeny upon the world. But when Rita dies shortly after managing to kill one of the smaller creatures, she is shocked to find herself transported back through time to the beginning of the very same day with (seemingly) no one else knowing what’s about to happen.

In its opening act, All You Need Is Kill unfolds like a beautiful, but gruesome, Groundhog Day riff. Every day Rita gets up, nervously goes about her day, and tries to figure out how to change her fate before Darol’s spawn find new ways to kill her. She reasons that there’s no use in trying to explain her predicament to other people because of how unbelievable everything about it is. At first, death seems inevitable. But when Rita crosses paths with Keiji (Natsuki Hanae, Jadon Muniz) — a nervous gamer who also knows that time is repeating itself — Rita locks in and begins to look at each loop as a chance to study Darol while learning to pilot her armor more skillfully.

While Edge of Tomorrow winkingly nodded to the fact that there were some video game-y elements to its premise, the new All You Need Is Kill much more explicitly acknowledges that Rita and Keiji are trapped in a very roguelike situation. With each loop, the duo become a better alien-slaying team and realize their chances of survival are better when they upgrade their weapons. But every brutal death / resurrection cycle wears on their morality and leaves them wondering if all their hard-earned progress is in vain.

Aside from its focus on a female protagonist, the biggest difference between this All You Need Is Kill and previous adaptations is a wholly new art direction spearheaded by Tomotaka Kubo (Promare, Mary and the Witch’s Flower). Kubo and character designer Izumi Murakami present this world as a lush wonderland awash in vibrant colors that becomes even more strangely gorgeous whenever Darol’s menacing drones are on screen. The original All You Need Is Kill and Edge of Tomorrow’s power suits were hulking behemoths that seemed ill suited for battle with skittering aliens. But here, mechanical designer Junji Okubo (Star Wars: Visions’ “Lop & Ochō”) reimagines them as sleek extensions of their pilots that almost seem organic.

Those visual changes give this iteration of All You Need Is Kill a distinct personality and make its action sequences a dazzling feast for the eyes. Even if you’re familiar with All You Need Is Kill, the new adaptation is worth seeing if only to appreciate how each telling of this story has its own unique energy. And if this is your first time encountering Sakurazaka’s work, you’re in for a wild ride.

            <div id="article-text">If you’re a fan of 3D Nintendo games, you’ll find plenty to love with Big Hops.

If you’re a fan of 3D Nintendo games, you’ll find plenty to love with Big Hops.

While playing Big Hops, a new 3D platformer starring an adorable frog, I kept feeling like I was breaking the game — and, like with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, breaking it is kind of the point.

In Big Hops, you play as a frog named Hop. Early on, Hop is taken away from his home, and he works to get back by collecting airship parts from a few different areas, each with its own cute animal characters and storylines. Because he’s a frog, the primary way you interact with things is by slinging his tongue. You can use it to grab pots to toss and break them for coins, as a grappling hook to reach new areas, and to snag foods with special powers you can find littered throughout the game’s colorful, cartoony worlds.

With the combination of the tongue, Hop’s Super Mario-like jumps, dives, and wall runs, and a Zelda-like stamina meter for climbing walls, you can easily slingshot around the world and climb dizzying heights. But those special foods are what really let you get creative. A mushroom turns into a bounce pad to help you climb higher. A thrown apple becomes a grappling point on a wall. Tossing a cactus turns it into a tightrope you can use to cross chasms. (Technically, they’re not all foods — one is an oil ball, one is a bomb rock — but you get the idea.)

Best of all, you can store multiple foods at once in Hop’s backpack. By bringing the right foods to the right problem, you can come up with your own solutions to platforming sections, even surpassing the intended solutions. With one tricky wall-running challenge, I kept falling just short of the goal. But when I accidentally landed on a wall near the end, I deployed a flying fruit that I could grapple onto so I could get to the final platform. I can’t wait to see what tricks speedrunners come up with.

In addition to the main objectives, there are also little purple dots scattered everywhere that you can pick up. (There were almost always some tucked in hidden corners or atop some perilously high cliff.) Collect enough dots, and you can earn trinkets to put on your backpack that give you special perks, like pointing out where the dots are on your compass or reducing how much stamina you use while climbing. You can also find and identify bugs, which are cute and can also help you earn even more bonuses. There are flower petals you can slurp up to help customize Hop’s outfits. A blueprint that I picked up turned into a railgun that could shoot tightropes over huge gaps. And since there are no enemies wandering around, you really get to focus on exploring and platforming — though there are a handful of boss “fights” that I didn’t find too challenging.

It all creates a virtuous cycle that encourages your own solutions to basically everything in the game and rewards you for finding them. If you’re a fan of 3D Nintendo games — which was a lot of what I played growing up — you’ll find plenty to love with Big Hops. There are dedicated platforming rooms that reminded me of the secret areas in Super Mario Sunshine, one area is filled with gravity shifts like I remember from Super Mario Galaxy, and at one point I realized an intricate sewer area wouldn’t feel out of place as a Zelda dungeon.

Big Hops’ influences are obvious, but the way that it builds on them is what makes the game special.

Big Hops is available now on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC.

            <div id="article-text">The governor’s call to film ICE is part of an attempt to protect states’ rights — but not like that.

The governor’s call to film ICE is part of an attempt to protect states’ rights — but not like that.

As masked and armed men in combat armor swarmed throughout the Twin Cities, Gov. Tim Walz took to primetime television to ask Minnesotans to film ICE. The videos, he said, would “create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans — not just to establish a record for posterity, but to bank evidence for future prosecution.”

While the feds besieged hospitals and school bus stops and Targets, Walz imagined a future with something akin to the Nuremberg trials. His speech emphasized the legal system and the ballot box, a promise of peaceful regime change and a process of accountability. And it was as much emotional solace for his constituents as it was a demonstration for the courts. Minnesota is not in insurrection, Minnesota is not in revolt, Minnesota will follow the law — so, will the law now protect Minnesota?

The state of Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, is asking a federal judge to pause what the Trump administration is calling “Operation Metro Surge,” the descent of 2,000 masked and armed ICE agents on the Twin Cities. The lawsuit tries several different avenues to get there. It’s an uncurated shotgun blast of legal reasoning in a time of crisis. But one common thread binds it all together: states’ rights. Minnesota should have a say in what is happening on Minnesota’s turf; by locking the local authorities out and running roughshod over them, the feds have violated the basic compact of the Bill of Rights.

The feds have violated the basic compact of the Bill of Rights

It is primarily liberal states that have been targeted by Donald Trump, and liberal cities with sanctuary policies have been hit the hardest. The complaint in Minnesota v. Noem hammers at this in particular, going even further to point out the times Trump has complained about losing Minnesota in each of his presidential elections. The cities that Trump has already targeted — such as Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago — are led by Democratic mayors. Resistance there has been fierce both on the ground and in the courts. A couple days before Christmas, the Supreme Court handed down a shadow docket decision in the National Guard cases, a rare instance in which it ruled against Trump. The president then announced his “withdrawal” from those cities (he had been prevented from deploying the Guard at all in Chicago and Portland); within days, he turned his attention to Minnesota.

“The Tenth Amendment gives the State of Minnesota and its subdivisions, including the Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, inviolable sovereign authority to protect the health and wellbeing of all those who reside, work, or visit within their borders,” says the lawsuit, alleging that the ICE surge has paralyzed the city with fear and dysfunction.

In the logic of the lawsuit, the feds have undermined the local authorities by inflicting terror on Minnesotans: “They have the right to go to work, take their children to school, and move through public and private spaces free from fear of violence against themselves or their loved ones by their federal government. They are entitled to access city services and use city facilities without being harassed by federal agents in parking lots.”

The desire for self-determination is central to the conflict between Trump and his victims. Sanctuary cities are cities that, to some degree or another, have democratically chosen not to aid federal immigration enforcement. In that sense, of course the fight is all about states’ rights. That would be perfectly obvious.

But in another sense, the whole affair is inflected with an exhausting degree of irony. “States’ rights” has been a conservative talking point since the Civil War, lingering on and morphing into a pro-segregation dogwhistle during the Civil Rights Movement and beyond. As right-wing extremism grew in America, “states’ rights” merged with the militia movement in bizarre and incoherent ways.

An 11-day anti-government standoff in 1992, now known as Ruby Ridge, along with the Waco standoff the following year, spawned a very specific flavor of anti-government subculture. The bare facts of the Ruby Ridge standoff read like a series of hashtags from tradwife TikTok: homestead, homeschool, birthing shed. Timothy McVeigh’s bombing of Oklahoma City in 1995 was motivated in part by Ruby Ridge and Waco. Obama-era militia movements — like the militia that took over Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016 — treat Ruby Ridge and Waco as “primary symbolism” of federal overreach.

In the end, the state of Idaho charged an FBI sniper for shooting and killing a woman at Ruby Ridge. And under the same reasoning, argues law professor Carolyn Shapiro, Minnesota officials can prosecute the ICE agent who killed Renee Good. A conviction under state law, moreover, would not be pardonable by the president.

Parallels between an ICE agent shooting Renee Good in her car and an FBI sniper shooting Vicki Weaver feel obvious. If anything, Weaver’s shooting — which happened in crossfire that also killed a US marshal — feels rather tame. A mountain homestead bristling with guns is simply not the same as a car that is slowly rolling away.

The militias have not risen up in Renee Good’s name

But either way, a mother is now dead, and the militias have not risen up in Renee Good’s name. If they are in Minneapolis now, it is most likely on the other side. Even before Trump began his second term, militia groups have offered their support in carrying out mass deportation; we don’t know whether militia members are hiding behind ICE’s gaiters, but we do know that ICE recruitment screens its applicants so poorly that a journalist named in a right-wing watchlist for “antifa” was able to get a job offer. If the militias don’t have members in ICE, it is either because they lack follow-through or because they are the only people who have ever been rejected for the job. The thin veneer of anti-authoritarianism has shattered. The real opposition to federal tyranny is not being fought with guns on homesteads, but in city streets with smartphones and whistles. And the only chance of justice for Renee Good comes from a hypothetical state prosecution, should Minnesota fully exercise its states’ rights.

The feds have no intention of letting it get that far, of course. Not only are they refusing to allow Minnesotan authorities access to evidence, but on Friday, the Justice Department launched a criminal investigation of Gov. Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. Earlier in the week, the DOJ tried to pressure the US attorney’s office to bring charges against Renee Good’s wife. At least six federal prosecutors resigned in response. This included the career prosecutor — a born-and-bred Minnesotan — who had been handling a series of fraud cases around state safety net programs since 2022. These very real cases were recently spun off by a conservative influencer from Utah into flimsy and viral allegations of fraud against Somali-run daycare centers.

Nick Shirley’s YouTube video got millions of views, but most importantly, the attention of the president himself, who would repeat the word “fraud” over and over again as his pretext for Operation Metro Surge. The content mill left a mother dead and bleeding in her car.

Content brought ICE to their door; now, for better or worse, Minnesota is fighting ICE with content. The Minneapolis city council president is posting videos every day, including one where an ICE agent shoves him. “If this is how they treat the President of the Minneapolis City Council who is legally observing, just think of what they’re doing to everyone else in our City,” he posted. The governor is on television telling people to “carry your phone with you at all times, and if you see ICE in your neighborhood, take out that phone and hit record.”

Video after video is uploaded to social media networks. In these clips, Minnesotans flock to and cluster around arrests, holding up their smartphones as faceless thugs wrestle their victims to the ground.

Trump is behaving as though he craves civil war

Walz’s promise that the videos will be used for accountability is not totally baseless. Minnesota v. Noem is already scattered throughout with references to videos of arrests of US citizens. The footnotes of the complaint are an eyesore, filled with links to YouTube, X, and Truth Social. The administration’s hyperbolic, all-caps posts are presented as evidence of irrational animus and malice directed at the state of Minnesota; the clips of the ICE arrests as objective proof of how that animus has manifested into a regime of terror that has nothing to do with immigration enforcement.

But what happens at the end of the day if a judge doesn’t grant an injunction? What happens if there is no Nuremberg? What happens if the regime never changes? What happens if the law doesn’t free Minneapolis from the federal incursion?

A marginally less demented government would have withdrawn ICE from Minneapolis the day after Renee Good was killed. Instead, the feds are trying to put her wife, the mayor, and the governor in jail. Trump is behaving as though he craves civil war — or maybe more accurately, like we’re already in one. Walz’s call to film ICE anticipates that either the courts or the electoral process will bring Trump to heel. Sousveillance is the last weapon of states’ rights before they get ugly in a uniquely American way. When states’ rights are exercised peacefully, that is merely the Constitution in action. Once they step beyond those confines, we are on course toward the civil war that Trump is so desperate for.

Meanwhile, the steady stream of videos from Minneapolis has become a narrative unto itself — in a strange reversal of the xenophobic hysteria that swept Trump into office, ICE has been cast in the role of outsiders marauding across the homeland. Like the feds rolling up to Ruby Ridge, they are unwelcome and unloved interlopers, hounded by whistles and Honda Fits. The invader must be expelled. Minnesota should be for the Minnesotans.

            <h2>Fear and blogging (and prerelease laptop testing) in Las Vegas</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/862985/asus-zenbook-a16-snapdragon-x2-ces-early-testing-hands-on">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I worked exclusively on a pre-production Asus Zenbook A16 with a Snapdragon X2 processor throughout CES, and I came away impressed.

At CES, I did what you’re not supposed to do: I brought a pre-production laptop to use as my primary workhorse during a hectic event. The unproven rifle in question is the new Arm-based Asus Zenbook A16. It’s a 16-inch laptop that weighs less than a 13-inch MacBook Air and comes with a high-end Snapdragon X2 processor. Going into CES with a Windows on Arm laptop running an unreleased processor sounds like a recipe for disaster. But to my surprise, aside from pre-production hardware glitches, I came away impressed.

The Zenbook A16 that Asus sent me for early testing has a Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme X2E-94-100 chip. It’s one of the flagship chips from Qualcomm’s upcoming X2 processor family, sporting 18 cores — six performance and 12 efficiency. In the A16, it’s paired with a massive 48GB of RAM, a 2TB SSD, and a nice 2880 x 1800 / 120Hz OLED display. There’s no price yet, but Asus rep Anthony Spence tells The Verge it might land around $1,599.99 or $1,699.99 — in the range of a higher-spec 15-inch M4 MacBook Air or an entry-level-ish 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro.

First things first: As a pre-production model, this Zenbook A16 is not ready for benchmark testing. And bugs cropped up quickly. To name a few: Windows Hello face unlocking never worked, and the laptop unexpectedly went to sleep mid-use a few times a day. Thankfully, it woke up and resumed where I left off within seconds every time. These are obviously disconcerting problems, but it’s pre-production hardware running a Canary build of Windows 11 26H1 that’s exclusive to Snapdragon X2 laptops. I certainly felt like that canary sometimes, but I expect the issues should be solved on final hardware and software. (If not, I’ll be yelling about it in an eventual review.)

But despite the bugs, the A16’s performance was very good. It was the only computer I used during the holiday break to prewrite many CES news embargoes, and it was snappy from the start. It had no problem handling my usual workload of dozens of Google Chrome tabs across two or three virtual desktops, writing in Google Docs and WordPress, messaging in Slack and Signal, and simultaneously listening to music in Spotify. But that level of multitasking shouldn’t be a big lift for this chip and that much RAM. The bigger test was editing photos in Lightroom Classic, especially using it on the go in Vegas at CES — where I occasionally had to do lightning-fast edits of 50-megapixel RAW images shot on my Sony A1 camera.

I brought the Zenbook with me to CES, but I also brought the M5 MacBook Pro as a fallback. I was ready to carry both, or drop the A16 in favor of the MacBook if needed, but on day one I took a chance and left the MacBook in my hotel room. I brought the Zenbook from my Razer waifu briefing to CES Unveiled, where I mostly shot picturesfor colleagues. The Snapdragon X2 chip was snappy when editing through the 70-ish photos I shot while under that time crunch.

At times, using Adobe Lightroom Classic on the Zenbook felt like the speed I’m used to with Apple’s chips. RAW images were quick to import from the built-in SD card reader — something I wish all laptops had. I could quickly cull through pictures in the Library module, and making quick brightness and color adjustments in the more demanding Develop module was also fast. The only time things slowed was when I took a more heavy-handed approach to color adjustments (because CES lighting is dreadful), and especially when I used Lightroom’s masking tool with automatic subject detection.

So my first day at CES (which was two days before the show officially started) worked out great with the A16. But on the following days I shot hundreds more photos. I had a bunch of appointments and briefings, like my chance to photograph the Lenovo Legion Pro rollable gaming laptop concept, and various mini missions to hunt things down on the show floor — like Asus’ Wi-Fi 8 router concept. That’s when it started bogging down a little bit.

Lightroom Classic started leaving me hanging between adjustments and taking whole seconds to load full-res images. But that’s how Lightroom gets sometimes on Windows, and even sometimes on Macs, if you’re trying to work fast and haven’t rebooted in a while to let it clear cache or optimize the catalog.

On my last full day at the show, I was more judicious about closing Lightroom between edit sessions and not leaving unnecessary apps open in the background. The Zenbook went back to feeling like a nimble editing machine. When showing my colleague Sean Hollister photos from my stroll across the Las Vegas Convention Center show floor, I could tell he was surprised with how quickly I was flipping through high-res shots.

I’d still pick a MacBook Pro for high-demand photo editing, but the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme helped this Zenbook A16 feel more MacBook-like than most other Windows laptops I’ve used — especially because the bulk of this was on battery power. Like M-series Macs, Snapdragon X laptops offer the same performance on battery and wall power. Intel and AMD processors typically offer noticeably lower performance on battery power. We’ll have to see if it’s the same story with the upcoming Intel Panther Lake and AMD Gorgon Point chips. Getting equal performance on a charger or off makes a huge difference when you’re editing on the fly, which is part of why I’ve always preferred editing on Mac laptops over Windows.

If this first taste of the Snapdragon X2 processors is an indication, Qualcomm’s new chips should once again impress with performance and battery life — but, if it matters to you, they’ll likely still falter with gaming (they’re like Macs in that way too). Many games remain incompatible, and graphically demanding ones that actually run, like Cyberpunk 2077 and Resident Evil 4 (2023), are workable but look quite rough.

Despite those shortcomings, I think the Asus Zenbook A16 shows lots of promise for a thin-and-light Windows laptop with good performance. Though, if price estimates hold true, that performance won’t come cheap. I’m excited to see what a final review unit can do, as this buggy pre-production model already got me through the trenches of CES — a tricky gauntlet for any laptop.

Have you noticed that physical keyboards are kind of having a comeback? There’s the Clicks stuff from CES this year, but also Unihertz is making a new Titan phone, and I keep hearing from people who like the Minimal Phone — there’s just something in the water about these devices that are less focused on screen and more on doing stuff.

When I think about physical keyboards, I think about Kevin Michaluk. Yes, CrackBerry Kevin himself, the man behind the Bring Back BlackBerry movement, and the founder and president of Clicks. Nobody has believed in physical keyboards longer, or more fervently, than Kevin. I asked him to share his homescreen with us, in part to see what weird keyboard phone he’s using (as you’ll see, I was very disappointed), but also to see how a true typing nut might organize his digital life.

Here’s Kevin’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:

The phone: It’s an iPhone 17 Pro Max in Deep Blue, with a Clicks Keyboard in Smoke. I also have a 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange as backup, and a “RAZRBERRY” (i.e., a Moto Razr w/ Clicks Keyboard). The 17 Pro Max is my primary, so let’s look at that…

The wallpaper: It’s a wallpaper one of our designers made. Dark-mode-friendly with a bit of pizzazz. I often just make solid color wallpapers using the Color tool in the Add New Wallpaper section of iOS. Occasionally I rock a photo of my wife and/or our dog on the lockscreen (especially when I’m in the proverbial doghouse).

The apps: Photos, Google Maps, Clicks, ChatGPT, Shopify, Triple Whale, Twos, LinkedIn, Instagram, Signal, Messages, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Beeper, Phone, Gmail, Safari, Camera.

Too many apps! I usually try to do a purge early in the year while on a flight (it’s an annual tradition!) and delete unused ones and cancel any subscriptions I’m still paying for but not actively using. I have a bad habit of trying new apps on free trials and then forgetting to cancel them. I often wonder, how much subscription app revenue in the industry is tied to “zombie” customers who forget to cancel?

Over the years I’ve tried to optimize my app layouts time and time again, and am pretty happy with the current structure, though I actually have a shortcut hack these days that makes the homescreen layout a bit null and void: I pretty much use Spotlight search and type for them. With the Clicks Keyboard, I just press Command + Spacebar and I just start typing the app, contact, or setting I want and I bypass apps and folders altogether. I also have tons of shortcuts on the keyboard mapped out for dialing contacts or doing deep app actions like opening Spotify directly to the playlist I want. It’s a next-level iPhone experience.

I optimize the bottom half of the phone for my most-used messaging apps — Slack / WhatsApp / Telegram — so they’re within an easy reach of the thumb. Shoutout to Beeper — I get a lot of DMs on all of the different social platforms, so use this as my universal DM inbox for X, Instagram, Discord, LinkedIn, etc. This way I can better avoid getting sucked into the feeds of those apps but still reply to messages. I also keep my smart home apps and music apps in a folder on the homescreen as I want those accessible. The one widget that earns a Page 1 slot is Calendar.

Page two is my Health / Habits page. My 2026 resolutions don’t start until I’ve recovered from CES (usually the third week of January!), which is when I try to swipe in here more often and use the fitness and food apps and trackers.

Page three is all the other apps in MY folders. I hate Apple’s auto suggested and populated App Library. I need to be able to set up my folders and put the apps in myself so I remember where to find everything later (I wish there was an option to disable the app library!).

I also asked Kevin to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:

Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week.

“If you like word games, check out WurdWeb on Apple Arcade, which features a daily game. It’s part of my daily routine along with the NYT games, Apple News games and Rogue Words (a free Balatro-like Scrabble word game).” — Kurt

“Cooked is a neat tool for ingesting recipes. To use it, I prepend a recipe url with ‘cooked.wiki/.’” — BTTK

“Got myself a Walkman in 2026. I’m a music hunter at heart and while I won’t quit beloved Apple Music, I am slowly rebuilding my own library. Taking my love of intentional music listening on vinyl on the go. I’m back in my iPod era. It’s been fun.” — Manny

“Puzzmo added a new game for the new year called Ribbit, and it’s got everything. Words, frogs, a rotate button… What more could you ask for?” — Andy

“Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman. Specifically, the audiobooks. The narrator, Jeff Hays, is so good he will ruin all other audiobooks.” — Weddle

“I open up Sill every morning to find out what events and stories my friends and folks I follow on Bluesky and Mastodon have been sharing while I’ve been sleeping and have been otherwise unplugged.” — Mita

“I’ve been watching a lot of Landman on Paramount. I know that Billy Bob Thornton more or less plays the same guy in everything now, but I feel strongly that it is an underrated show. Plus it has Sam Elliot. The show’s biggest detriment is that it is on Paramount Plus.” — Geoff

“I’d like to make a suggestion for a great video about ASML. Who’s that? The company that makes the machines that make the etched wafers for processors. The science that goes into it is like magic. Well worth the hour view time.” — Shawn

“Hijack season two on Apple TV is finally out. Seems really good so far!” — Nathan

I’ve been traveling a bunch recently, which for me means a lot of time spent manually downloading stuff to an iPad to watch on planes. Most streaming apps now allow downloads, which is great, but you know what I’ve really been enjoying? YouTube’s “Smart Downloads” playlist, which just grabs a bunch of stuff the algorithm thinks you’ll like and dumps it on your phone. Mine is currently a little overstuffed with toddler-friendly content, and the algorithm here doesn’t seem to take big swings, but I actually appreciate that. It’s just a bunch of stuff I haven’t seen but am basically guaranteed to like.

If you have YouTube Premium, next time you travel, try turning on the Smart Downloads, and maybe also download your Watch Later list if that’s a thing you keep updated. I much prefer this to fighting with the plane’s Wi-Fi.

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Generative coding is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Learn more about why that is, and check out the rest of the list!

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s decision to introduce advertisements inside ChatGPT for free users and its new $8 “Go” tier is already shaping up to be one of the most consequential pivots in generative AI’s short history. It’s not a simple business tweak. It’s a reframing of where digital intent, attention, and commercial influence intersect in an age where conversations increasingly replace search bars.

Yet, this moment will be remembered not as the day ads arrived in ChatGPT, but as the day two decades of assumptions about search and digital advertising broke open.

Read that again: ads won’t sit beside or above a list of links, as they do on Google. They will appear inside the conversational flow, at the moment a user has just received a helpful answer.

This is not incremental. It’s a new interface for intent.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

For years, OpenAI developed ChatGPT as an ad-free oasis in a web saturated with promotions, pop-ups, and sponsored results. Now it’s embracing the oldest monetization strategy on the internet: advertising.  The company insists ads will be clearly labeled, won’t influence AI responses, and won’t depend on selling individual user data. Ads will appear below answers when relevant, and paid tiers like Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise remain ad-free.

To understand why this matters, you need to see it not as an ad insertion, but as a shift in how commerce enters human intent, at the moment of decision, not distraction.

In a classic Google search, thoughtful queries turn into ranked links and ad slots beside them. In a ChatGPT conversation, a user asks a question, gets an answer, and stays in context; the frame never changes. An ad beneath that response isn’t an interruption; it’s an extension of the thought process. This subtle repositioning changes how brands can engage a user: they’re not chasing clicks after a search, they’re walking up with the answer itself.

That’s a paradigm shift. Brands are no longer competing for top billing on a results page; they are competing to be part of the narrative that unfolds between a question and a resolution. It’s a level of semantic proximity to intent that search ads never capture, because even the best keywords are guesses at nuance. ChatGPT sees nuance first.

Let restaurants, retailers, and SaaS companies imagine that: not just showing an ad after someone searches “best CRM tools,” but appearing contextually right when someone asks “what CRM features matter to small teams.” That changes where conversion flows start.

This isn’t happening. OpenAI’s infrastructure costs are enormous, and its free user base dwarfs its subscriber base. Only a small fraction of ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly active users currently pay. Advertising offers a scalable revenue path that could subsidize free access and help the company balance long-term costs.

It’s striking that OpenAI once positioned ads as a “last resort.” Now they’re a strategic mainstay. That tells you two things: the scale of AI compute bills is real, and the company is trying to find a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on subscription fatigue.

ChatGPT’s value isn’t just utility; it’s credibility, the feeling that the answer isn’t trying to sell you something. Introducing ads atop or below answers may be technically neutral, but perception is sticky. Once a user notices “Sponsored” within the thoughtful flow of a conversation, trust becomes negotiable. Academic research on ads in AI interfaces shows that even labeled ads can reduce perceived trust and make users feel manipulated, especially if they blur with responses.

OpenAI recognizes this. It’s promising to avoid showing ads in sensitive contexts, like health, politics, or personal advice, and won’t target minors. It’s also pledging that ads won’t twist the model’s answers.

Yet trust isn’t a function of code; it’s a feeling users develop over time. One poorly placed ad recommendation, even if accurate, can make people wonder whether the answer was shaped by commercial rather than objective logic.

From a creative standpoint, this is both exciting and fraught. The ads we’ve long tolerated have trained us to think of marketing as interruption: banners, pop-ups, pre-roll videos. ChatGPT’s approach suggests something closer to contextual dialogue, where an ad feels like a part of exploration. The brands that succeed here won’t be the loudest; they’ll be the most relevant, most resonant, and most human. They’ll read like answers, not impositions, because they’re embedded in answers.

That opens a new creative demand: marketers will need to think less about clickbait hooks and more about narrative relevance, how to be helpful within a user’s question, not beside it.

Is this the end of Google? No. Google’s advertising machine is vast, integrated, and highly optimized. Its AI integration in search, including AI summaries, already blends insight with ads in ways that are more sophisticated than many realize.

But the rise of ads in ChatGPT signals that intent has multiple layers now. There’s traditional search intent tied to links and pages, and there’s conversational intent captured in natural language interactions. These layers will coexist, sometimes reinforce, sometimes compete.

Advertisers and creators today often optimize for keywords. Tomorrow, they’ll optimize for conversational moments, the semantic cues that signal purchase interest within a dialogue.

The rollout now is just the beginning. If AI systems evolve into multi-modal, interactive assistants that help people plan trips, make purchases, write essays, plan budgets, and solve problems of every sort, the point at which commerce enters that interaction becomes crucial.

The question is no longer “Will people see our ad?” but “Will they trust our recommendation when it pops up next to an AI answer?”

That’s the real test, and the real frontier.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bizzynow-opens-mamacrowd-equity-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.
