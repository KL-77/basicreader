            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last year, we drove BMW’s new iX3. It’s the first of a series of electric BMWs to use a newly developed platform, known as the “Neue Klasse.” Later this year, we’ll see the first fully electric version of the 3 Series when the i3 sedan debuts. And next year, BMW enthusiasts will finally find out what the brand’s M division—which infuses motorsport into the vehicles like few others—can do with an EV.

There have been M-tuned EVs before now, more powerful variants of the i4, iX, and i7. And each time we’ve driven them, BMW has been at pains to point out that these weren’t true M cars, not like the M3 or M5. Honestly, they weren’t better than the cheaper, less powerful versions, something that won’t be allowed for next year’s performance EV, which might be called something like the iM3, assuming the naming convention remains logic-based.

“The next generation of models are set to establish a new benchmark in the high-performance vehicle segment,” says Franciscus van Meel, managing director of BMW M GmbH. “With the latest generation of Neue Klasse technology, we are taking the BMW M driving experience to a new level and will inspire our customers with outstanding, racetrack-ready driving dynamics for everyday use.”

Technology is the key to distinguishing the M EV from its more sedate siblings. The Neue Klasse platform hews to the software-defined vehicle trend, where a handful of powerful computers each control a wide array of functions, rather than dozens or hundreds of discrete electronic control units in black boxes each doing a single job. One computer handles infotainment, and another deals with automated driving and active safety systems. A third handles the relatively mundane but no less important job of climate control, plus the seats and doors and windows.

However, the important one here is called the Heart of Joy, which runs M-specific software, called BMW M Dynamic Performance Control. This offers an order of magnitude faster response in terms of the car’s electronic dynamic control compared to current M models, which is put to good use controlling the four electric motors that will propel the electric M.

BMW M has made M-specific front and rear drive units, each with a motor for each wheel arranged in parallel, with a gearbox on each side. On top of each drive unit are the power electronics that control it all. BMW was a little cagey with details when it briefed us on the electric M powertrain in Spain last November and wouldn’t elaborate on what kind of electric motor it’s using in the M drive units, but we suspect they’re permanent synchronous motors.

There’s also an M-specific high-voltage battery. Expect at least 100 kWh; the stock pack has 108.7 kWh net, but the cylindrical cells have been optimized for power delivery, and there’s new two-sided cooling and even a different cell layout within the pack. The cells look the same, according to Philip Guerrero, project lead for high-voltage batteries at BMW, but they have lower internal resistance and increased power density, despite using the same cell chemistry.

A performance EV with lightning-fast but precise control of each wheel does indeed sound tantalizing, and BMW told us it’s aiming at a new benchmark in driving dynamics on track as well as on the road. And it’s taking a page out of Hyundai’s book with the addition of a simulated gearshift mode. As we’ve seen in the Ioniq 5 N, using steering wheel paddles to alter the pedal mapping for lift-off regenerative braking and the throttle goes a long way to adding some engagement to a performance EV by replicating a transmission, especially if you implement it in a way that even lets you bounce off a “rev limiter” for more fidelity. For the people who think that sounds like no fun, take heart in the fact that as always, you can just choose not to turn that function on.

As we’ve noted in the past, the Neue Klasse is BMW’s most sustainable platform ever, and that, too, carries through to the M Neue Klasse. Instead of carbon fiber, it’s switching to a natural fiber alternative called Bcomp that emits 40 percent less carbon dioxide during the production process, while still offering a great strength-to-weight ratio.</div>

            <h2>The RAM shortage’s silver lining: Less talk about “AI PCs”</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/the-ram-shortages-silver-lining-less-talk-about-ai-pcs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">RAM prices have soared, which is bad news for people interested in buying, building, or upgrading a computer this year, but it’s likely good news for people exasperated by talk of so-called AI PCs.

As Ars Technica has reported, the growing demands of data centers, fueled by the AI boom, have led to a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips, driving prices to skyrocket.

In an announcement today, Ben Yeh, principal analyst at technology research firm Omdia, said that in 2025, “mainstream PC memory and storage costs rose by 40 percent to 70 percent, resulting in cost increases being passed through to customers.”

Overall, global PC shipments increased in 2025, according to Omdia, (which pegged growth at 9.2 percent compared to 2024), and IDC, (which today reported 9.6 percent growth), but analysts expect PC sales to be more tumultuous in 2026.

“The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile,” Jean Philippe Bouchard, research VP with IDC’s worldwide mobile device trackers, said in a statement.

Both analyst firms expect PC makers to manage the RAM shortage by raising prices and by releasing computers with lower memory specs. IDC expects price hikes of 15 to 20 percent and for PC RAM specs to “be lowered on average to preserve memory inventory on hand,” Bouchard said. Omdia’s Yeh expects “leaner mid to low-tier configurations to protect margins.”

“These RAM shortages will last beyond just 2026, and the cost-conscious part of the market is the one that will be most impacted,” Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for worldwide mobile device trackers at IDC, told Ars via email.

IDC expects vendors to “prioritize midrange and premium systems to offset higher component costs, especially memory.”

The increased costs have implications for the concept of “AI PCs,” a term OEMs have used consistently over the last two years as they sought to leverage the growth of generative AI chatbots to drive computer sales.

Shoppers, however, have been either too reluctant or too savvy to buy into manufacturer-made AI PC hype.

“PC OEMs had trouble selling the on-device AI message even before the memory shortages,” Ubrani said.

IT buyers will likely also consider local AI capabilities a lower priority if OEMs lower RAM specs to address the component shortage.

“General interest in AI PCs has been wavering for a while, since cloud-based options are widely available and the use cases for on-device AI have been limited. This indifference (between on-device and cloud-based) from a demand perspective might work in favor of PC OEMs, as they don’t need to provide large amounts of RAM,” Ubrani said.

With RAM pricing stability possibly not arriving until 2027, per Ubrani, it may be a while until RAM is readily available enough for it to make sense for PC companies to put as much emphasis on AI PCs, which generally require at least 16GB of memory, as they have in the past two years.

We’ve already seen a shift from AI PCs from Dell. In 2025, it discontinued its XPS brand of consumer laptops and desktops, partially due to the belief that “the AI PC market is quickly evolving,” Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, told media outlets at the time.

“Everyone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity,” he said.

At CES 2026, however, Dell resurrected the XPS brand and reframed its laptop marketing around build, battery life, and display quality. Terwilliger also sang a different tune.

“… what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” Terwilliger said at a press briefing ahead of the show. “In fact, I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

Microsoft also seems aware of the shortcomings of AI PCs. In December, The Information reported that CEO Satya Nadella had sent an email to engineering heads expressing disappointment with the consumer version of Copilot. He reportedly wrote that tools for connecting Copilot with Outlook and Gmail “for [the] most part don’t really work” and are “not smart.” The publication also reported that Nadella delegated some of his responsibilities to spend more time on Copilot. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report.

With that in mind, it stands to reason that we’re far from hearing the last about AI PCs. Currently, there are still plenty of stakeholders pushing AI PCs in 2026. But as we all await the end of the RAM shortage, it seems that at least some brands will attempt to build AI PCs with a significant and relevant purpose and scale back on trying to get people to buy a computer that can handle AI.

The idea of AI PCs isn’t inherently a bad thing. But in recent years, it felt like technology companies were exploiting generative AI to convince people and companies to buy more or more powerful devices, even if they didn’t need them or local AI processing.

Now, with a RAM crunch and lack of customer demand, there’s hope for AI PC marketing spiel to relent somewhat and for PC companies to try harder to prove that AI PCs are a solution to a problem, not a solution searching for a problem.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/never-before-seen-linux-malware-is-far-more-advanced-than-typical/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers have discovered a never-before-seen framework that infects Linux machines with a wide assortment of modules that are notable for the range of advanced capabilities they provide to attackers.

The framework, referred to as VoidLink by its source code, features more than 30 modules that can be used to customize capabilities to meet attackers’ needs for each infected machine. These modules can provide additional stealth and specific tools for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement inside a compromised network. The components can be easily added or removed as objectives change over the course of a campaign.

VoidLink can target machines within popular cloud services by detecting if an infected machine is hosted inside AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and there are indications that developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr in future releases. To detect which cloud service hosts the machine, VoidLink examines metadata using the respective vendor’s API.

Similar frameworks targeting Windows servers have flourished for years. They are less common on Linux machines. The feature set is unusually broad and is “far more advanced than typical Linux malware,” said researchers from Checkpoint, the security firm that discovered VoidLink. Its creation may indicate that the attacker’s focus is increasingly expanding to include Linux systems, cloud infrastructure, and application deployment environments, as organizations increasingly move workloads to these environments.

“VoidLink is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to maintain long-term, stealthy access to compromised Linux systems, particularly those running on public cloud platforms and in containerized environments,” the researchers said in a separate post. “Its design reflects a level of planning and investment typically associated with professional threat actors rather than opportunistic attackers, raising the stakes for defenders who may never realize their infrastructure has been quietly taken over.”

The VoidLink interface is localized for Chinese-affiliated operators, an indication that it likely originates from a Chinese-affiliated development environment. Symbols and comments within the source code suggest that VoidLink remains under development. Another sign the framework is not yet completed: Checkpoint found no signs it has infected any machines in the wild. Company researchers discovered it last month in a series of clusters of Linux malware available through VirusTotal.

Included in the batch of binaries was a two-stage loader. The final implant includes core modules embedded that can be augmented by plugins that are downloaded and installed at runtime. The capabilities of the 37 modules discovered so far include:

With no indication that VoidLink is actively targeting machines, there’s no immediate action required by defenders, although they can obtain indicators of compromise from the Checkpoint blog post. VoidLink still indicates defenders should apply vigilance when working with Linux machines.</div>

            <h2>Lawsuit: DHS wants “unlimited subpoena authority” to unmask ICE critics</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is fighting to unmask the owner of Facebook and Instagram accounts of a community watch group monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

Defending the right to post about ICE sightings anonymously is a Meta account holder for MontCo Community Watch, John Doe.

Doe has alleged that when the DHS sent a “summons” to Meta asking for subscriber information, it infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity, i.e., the right to publish content critical of government agencies and officials without fear of government retaliation. He also accused DHS of ignoring federal rules and seeking to vastly expand its authority to subpoena information to unmask ICE’s biggest critics online.

“I believe that my anonymity is the only thing standing between me and unfair and unjust persecution by the government of the United States,” Doe said in his complaint.

In response, DHS alleged that the community watch group that posted “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that a statute regulating imports and exports empowered DHS to investigate the group’s alleged threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder” ICE agents.

DHS claims that Meta must comply with the subpoena because the government needs to investigate a “serious” threat “to the safety of its agents and the performance of their duties.”

On Wednesday, a US district judge will hear arguments to decide if Doe is right or if DHS can broadly unmask critics online by claiming it’s investigating supposed threats to ICE agents. With more power, DHS officials have confirmed they plan to criminally prosecute critics posting ICE videos online, Doe alleged in a lawsuit filed last October.

DHS alleged that the community watch group posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that DHS is authorized to investigate the group and that compelling interest supersedes Doe’s First Amendment rights.

According to Doe’s most recent court filing, DHS is pushing a broad reading of a statute that empowers DHS to subpoena information about the “importation/exportation of merchandise&quot;—like records to determine duties owed or information to unmask a drug smuggler or child sex trafficker. DHS claims the statute isn’t just about imports and exports but also authorizes DHS to seize information about anyone they can tie to an investigation of potential crimes that violate US customs laws.

However, it seems to make no sense, Doe argued, that Congress would “silently embed unlimited subpoena authority in a provision keyed to the importation of goods.” Doe hopes the US district judge will agree that DHS’s summons was unconstitutional.

“The subscriber information for social media accounts publishing speech critical of ICE that DHS seeks is completely unrelated to the importation/exportation of merchandise; the records are outside the scope of DHS’s summons power,” Doe alleged.

And even if the court agrees on DHS’s reading of the statute, DHS has not established that unmasking the owner of the community watch accounts would be relevant to any legitimate criminal investigation, Doe alleged.

To convince the court that the case was really about chilling speech, Doe attached every post made on the group’s Facebook and Instagram feeds. None show threats or arguably implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS claimed. Instead, the users shared “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils,” Doe said.

Ariel Shapell, an attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, told Ars that “if you go and look at the content on the Facebook and Instagram profiles at issue here, it’s pretty innocuous.”

DHS claimed to have received information about the group supposedly “stalking and gathering of intelligence on federal agents involved in ICE operations.” However, Doe argued that “unsurprisingly, neither DHS nor its declarant cites any post even allegedly constituting any such threat. To the contrary, all posts on these social media accounts constitute speech addressing important public issues fully protected under the First Amendment,” Doe argued.

“Reporting on, or even livestreaming, publicly occurring immigration operations is fully protected First Amendment activity,” Doe argued. “DHS does not, and cannot, show how such conduct constitutes an assault, kidnapping, or murder of a federal law enforcement officer, or a threat to do any of those things.”

Doe’s motion to quash the subpoena arrives at a time when recent YouGov polling suggests that Americans have reached a tipping point in ending support for ICE. YouGov’s poll found more people disapprove of how ICE is handling its job than approve, following the aftermath of nationwide anti-ICE protests over Renee Good’s killing. ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Good’s death and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

As sharing ICE footage has swayed public debate, DHS has seemingly sought to subpoena Meta and possibly other platforms for subscriber information.

In October, Meta refused to provide names of users associated with Doe’s accounts—as well as “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses&quot;—without further information from DHS. Meta then gave Doe the opportunity to move to quash the subpoena to stop the company from sharing information.

That request came about a week after DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests after account holders defended First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash the subpoena, Doe’s court filing said.

It’s unclear why DHS withdrew those subpoenas but maintained Doe’s. DHS has alleged that the government’s compelling interest in Doe’s identity outweighs First Amendment rights to post anonymously online. The agency also claimed it has met its burden to unmask Doe as “someone who is allegedly involved in threatening ICE agents and impeding the performance of their duties,” which supposedly “touches DHS’s investigation into threats to ICE agents and impediments to the performance of their duties.”

Whether Doe will prevail is hard to say, but Politico reported that DHS’s “defense will rest on whether DHS’s argument that posting videos and images of ICE officers and warnings about arrests is considered criminal activity.” It may weaken DHS’s case that Border Patrol Tactical Commander Greg Bovino recently circulated a “legal refresher” for agents in the field, reminding them that protestors are allowed to take photos and videos of “an officer or operation in public,” independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported.

Shapell told Ars that there seems to be “a lot of distance” between the content posted on Doe’s accounts and relevant evidence that could be used in DHS’s alleged investigation into criminal activity. And meanwhile, “there are just very clear First Amendment rights here to associate with other people anonymously online and to discuss political opinions online anonymously,” Shapell said, which the judge may strongly uphold as core protected activity as threats of government retaliation mount.

“These summonses chill people’s desire to communicate about these sorts of incredibly important developments on the Internet, even anonymously, when there’s a threat that they could be unmasked and investigated for this really core First Amendment protected activity,” Shapell said.

A win could reassure Meta users that they can continue posting about ICE online without fear of retaliation should Meta be pressed to share their information.

Ars could not immediately reach DHS for comment. Meta declined to comment, only linking Ars to an FAQ to help users understand how the platform processes government requests.</div>

            <h2>FDA deletes warning on bogus autism therapies touted by RFK Jr.‘s allies</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/warning-about-bogus-autism-treatments-vanishes-from-fdas-website/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, the Food and Drug Administration provided an informational webpage for parents warning them of the dangers of bogus autism treatments, some promoted by anti-vaccine activists and “wellness” companies. The page cited specifics scams and the “significant health risks” they pose.

But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has numerous ties to the wellness industry—that FDA information webpage is now gone. It was quietly deleted at the end of last year, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to Ars Technica.

The defunct webpage, titled “Be Aware of Potentially Dangerous Products and Therapies that Claim to Treat Autism,” provided parents and other consumers with an overview of the problem. It began with a short description of autism and some evidence-based, FDA-approved medications that can help manage autism symptoms. Then, the regulatory agency provided a list of some false claims and unproven, potentially dangerous treatments it had been working to combat. “Some of these so-called therapies carry significant health risks,” the FDA wrote.

The list included chelation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatments that those in the anti-vaccine and wellness spheres have championed.

Chelation is a real treatment for heavy metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning. But it has been co-opted by anti-vaccine activists and wellness gurus, who falsely claim it can treat autism, among other things. These sham treatments can come in a variety of forms, including sprays, suppositories, capsules, and liquid drops. Actual FDA-approved chelation therapy products are prescription only, the agency noted, and chelating certain minerals from the body “can lead to serious and life-threatening outcomes.”

Many anti-vaccine activists promote the false and thoroughly debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, and more specifically, that trace metal components in some vaccines cause the neurological disorder. For years, anti-vaccine activists like Kennedy focused on thimerosal, a vaccine preservative that contains ethylmercury. Thimerosal was largely removed from childhood vaccines by 2001 amid unfounded concerns. The removal made no impact on autism rates, and many studies have continued to show that it is safe and not a cause of autism. Anti-vaccine activists moved on to blame other vaccine components for autism, including aluminum, which is used in some vaccines to help spur protective immune responses. It too has been found to be safe and not linked to autism.

To address this nonexistent problem, anti-vaccine activists have touted chelation as a way to remove metals delivered via vaccines and treat autism. One of the most notorious of these activists is David Geier, whom Kennedy hired to the US health department last year to study the debunked connection between vaccines and autism. David Geier, along with his late father, Mark Geier, faced discipline from the Maryland State Board of Physicians in 2011 for, among other things, putting the health of autistic children at risk by treating them with unproven and dangerous hormone and chelation therapies. Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license. David Geier, who is not a scientist or doctor, was issued a civil fine for practicing medicine without a license.

The FDA’s now-deleted webpage also warned of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is basically a treatment in which a patient breathes oxygen inside a pressurized chamber. This, again, is a real treatment for some specific conditions, including decompression sickness experienced by scuba divers. But it has been embraced by the wellness industry as a treatment for a wide variety of conditions, including autism, and it is now being offered in settings without trained staff or proper equipment—sometimes with tragic outcomes.

In January 2025, a 5-year-old boy was killed in a hyperbaric chamber in a wellness center in Michigan after static electricity sparked a flash fire inside the chamber. The wellness center claimed to use the chambers to treat a variety of conditions, including autism.

Kennedy has continued to promote the therapy. In May, Kennedy joined Gary Brecka—a wellness influencer and supplement seller—for a hyperbaric oxygen chamber treatment, as well as intravenous nutrient drips. They then recorded a podcast in which Kennedy lambasted the financial influence of Big Pharma.

In July, KFF Health News reported that Kennedy and his wellness allies have made millions promoting unproven wellness products and treatments. Likewise, a story last week from The Wall Street Journal reported that Kennedy has surrounded himself with wellness moguls, including Brecka, who are profiting from the administration’s unambiguous embrace of unproven treatments.

Beyond chelation and hyperbaric chambers as bogus autism treatments, the FDA also warned of “detoxifying clay baths,” which are another way wellness companies falsely claim to draw out metals, toxins, or pollutants they claim are behind autism. The agency ended by noting that there’s a wide variety of other bogus products and claims, including raw camel milk, MMS (chlorine dioxide), and essential oils. Without an exhaustive list, the agency provided general advice to be skeptical of treatments that are said to treat a wide variety of conditions, are termed “miracle cures” or a “quick fix,” and those supported by anecdotes rather than scientific evidence.

When Ars Technica reached out to the US health department about the webpage’s disappearance, the agency claimed that it was “retired” during a “routine cleanup” last month, during which other old articles were also removed. The removed webpage on bogus autism treatments was dated 2019.

In lieu of that warning page, the health department pointed Ars to another page about health fraud, titled “Medication Health Fraud for Specific Diseases and Conditions.” The page includes brief information on nearly a dozen health topics, from cancer drug fraud to anti-aging scams. Some of the topics include links to more specific information, including a link to illegal cancer treatments from 2017, which had not been retired.

The webpage has a section on autism, but it has no links and is two sentences long. It states:

“Unproven drug products for sale that claim to cure or treat autism are misleading and deceptive. They can lead to serious health problems while offering false hope for a condition that currently has no cure.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/hegseth-wants-to-integrate-musks-grok-ai-into-military-networks-this-month/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he plans to integrate Elon Musk’s AI tool, Grok, into Pentagon networks later this month. During remarks at the SpaceX headquarters in Texas reported by The Guardian, Hegseth said the integration would place “the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department.”

The announcement comes weeks after Grok drew international backlash for generating sexualized images of women and children, although the Department of Defense has not released official documentation confirming Hegseth’s announced timeline or implementation details.

During the same appearance, Hegseth rolled out what he called an “AI acceleration strategy” for the Department of Defense. The strategy, he said, will “unleash experimentation, eliminate bureaucratic barriers, focus on investments, and demonstrate the execution approach needed to ensure we lead in military AI and that it grows more dominant into the future.”

As part of the plan, Hegseth directed the DOD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to use its full authority to enforce department data policies, making information available across all IT systems for AI applications.

“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.

If implemented, Grok would join other AI models the Pentagon has adopted in recent months. In July 2025, the defense department issued contracts worth up to $200 million for each of four companies, including Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI, for developing AI agent systems across different military operations. In December 2025, the Department of Defense selected Google’s Gemini as the foundation for GenAI.mil, an internal AI platform for military use.

Grok has faced multiple scandals since xAI received the July defense contract. Just days before the contract announcement, the chatbot began generating antisemitic content, declaring itself a “super-Nazi,” adopting the name “MechaHitler,” and posting racist material. The incident prompted one US government agency to drop Grok from a General Services Administration contract offering in August, according to emails reviewed by Wired.

More recently, as we mentioned above, users discovered they could create non-consensual intimate images of real people through Grok within the social media platform X. One researcher who conducted a 24-hour analysis estimated that Grok generated over 6,000 sexually suggestive images per hour.

xAI has not publicly addressed the image-generation concerns, though the company attempted to restrict some image-editing features to paid subscribers. The restrictions proved incomplete, as users could still access editing functions through different parts of the X platform and the standalone Grok app.

Indonesia blocked access to Grok on Saturday due to imagery issues, with Malaysia implementing a similar block shortly after. British regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X because Grok is being used to create manipulated images of women and children. Democratic senators have called for Apple and Google to remove X and Grok from their app stores until the company improves safeguards.

The Pentagon has not publicly explained its evaluation process for Grok given these incidents. Significant questions remain about which security measures will protect classified military networks from similar behavioral problems and which technical measures will attempt to keep Grok from confabulating inaccurate analysis of important military data.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On December 6, NASA’s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft, which has been studying the Red Planet’s upper atmosphere for over a decade, mysteriously went offline.

The spacecraft was expected to send telemetry back to Earth, signals that were never picked up by NASA’s Deep Space Network, a global system of massive radio antennas making up an interplanetary communications network.

Less than a week later, NASA issued a new update, admitting that MAVEN appeared to be “rotating in an unexpected manner when it emerged from behind Mars.” Then, on December 23, the agency issued its last update, promising that it’s “continuing efforts to recontact” its lost spacecraft.

But weeks later, things aren’t looking much better. As SpaceNews senior writer Jeff Foust pointed out, NASA planetary science division director Louise Prockter conceded during a Tuesday meeting that the agency is “very unlikely” to recover the MAVEN orbiter.

Not all hope is lost. Mars’ solar conjunction, a weeks-long period when Mars and Earth are on opposite sides of the Sun, will end on January 16, which will give NASA a new opportunity to reestablish contact.

In its latest December 23 update, NASA explained that the MAVEN team was attempting to “create a timeline of possible events and identify the likely root cause of the issue” by analyzing “tracking data fragments recovered from a December 6 radio science campaign.”

NASA also leveraged the Mastcam instrument attached to its Curiosity rover to attempt to take a picture of MAVEN, but failed to detect the missing spacecraft.

It’s a sad state of affairs, but fortunately there are three other spacecraft that can still relay communications between Mars missions and the Earth. A next-generation orbiter, dubbed Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, was also recently revived in president Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” act — though it remains unclear when it will launch.

For now, all we can hope is that NASA’s renewed efforts to make contact with MAVEN will prove successful once it emerges from behind Mars once again. But given Prockter’s latest comments, the situation isn’t looking promising.

            <div id="article-text">The future is here, and it’s bouncing all over the back alleys of China.

Numerous clips of autonomous delivery vans ripping around cities have swirled on Chinese social media in recent days, showcasing the new technology’s capabilities — as well as its many, many shortcomings.

One video which went viral on the Pinterest-like app Xiaohongshu shows a Neolix X3 unit bouncing aggressively as it barrels down a potholed gravel path. The X3 sports two massive lithium batteries on the bottom of its chassis, a configuration which clearly isn’t helping the vehicle’s suspension as it rattles down the block.

“The roads are still from the Qing Dynasty, but the cars are from the next century,” one user wrote under the original post.

Other examples abound, like one of the smaller Neolix X3s freaking out over a road littered with corn cobs, or the stubborn ZTO express delivery van which got itself stuck after driving through wet cement.

In one clip from September, a Shenzhen woman tried in vain to stop a robovan from running over her prized vegetables, which she had been drying out on the side of the road.

The sheer number of clips are indicative of the massive rollout of self-driving vans throughout China.

Neolix, for example, says it’s deployed over 10,000 robovans across 300 cities as of October, according to The Robot Report. In Qingdao alone, there are already more than 1,200 self-driving cargo vans, which have racked over 31 million miles and thousands of deliveries since they’ve been in operation.

Though Neolix isn’t the only robovan company operating throughout the People’s Republic, it’s certainly the biggest. It was the first to obtain an autonomous delivery license in 2021, enabling it to start accumulating miles on select public roads.

Other companies, like Rino.ai, are following in Neolix’s footsteps, with over 2,000 self-driving vans on the road in over 170 cities.

While the clips are unquestionably entertaining, the robovans are clearly presenting a safety hazard on the roads — and likely a glimpse of things to come for the rest of the world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the government shutdown in November, the Trump administration suddenly accelerated its plans to shutter over a dozen buildings and around 100 laboratories at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

The decision angered Democratic lawmakers, who accused them of going ahead with the “consolidation” effort without even consulting them.

In a November 10 letter addressed to Sean Duffy, who served as NASA’s interim administrator at the time, representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) noted that her staff had received “disturbing reports that NASA is directing the imminent closure of laboratories and facilities hosting mission-critical capabilities” at the GSFC.

Of particular concern is the campus’ main library, which was unceremoniously shut down last month, as the New York Times reported on December 31. NASA officials tried to downplay these concerns seemingly to no avail — as former and current staffers, advisors, and union representatives continue to watch in horror as the GSFC closures go on.

NASA insiders cried foul following the library’s closure, warning that critical and still-undigitized materials could be thrown out in what they said were reckless efforts by the Trump administration.

NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, who was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, was angered by the NYT‘s framing, accusing the newspaper of not fully reflecting the “context NASA shared.” He argued that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials.”

That’s despite later admitting that “some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following a “deliberate review” over a period of 60 days.

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens chimed in as well, describing the moves at Goddard as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman’s comments have seemingly done little to reassure rattled NASA staffers. In a January 7 response spotted by Astronomy, Matt Biggs, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — a union that represents thousands of NASA scientists and engineers — accused Isaacman of making “patently false” statements.

“The rapid and haphazard shutdown of the library at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, reported on by The New York Times, decimated this valuable collection housed at NASA’s largest research library,” Biggs wrote.

The labor union boss also took issue with Isaacman’s argument that the consolidation efforts were part of the 2022 Goddard Master Plan, which dates back to the Biden administration.

“This was not part of some ‘long-planned facilities consolidation’ as Isaacman claims,” Biggs wrote. “The Goddard Master Plan, written in 2022, does not call for the library’s closure. Building 21, which houses the library, was scheduled for renovation, not elimination.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for clarification. The agency failed to reply to a previous request for comment regarding details of the 2022 Master Plan.

Biggs also accused Isaacman of misleadingly stating on X that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

“That’s simply not true,” he wrote. “Much of the material that was available in the library in Greenbelt, Maryland, is copyrighted or unique out-of-print material that cannot or has not been digitized and will no longer be available to researchers.”

It’s a precarious moment, as NASA’s future continues to be debated in Congress. If it were up to the White House, the historic agency would face the largest budget cuts in its 67-year history. Lawmakers, however, have since passed a counteroffer that would leave the agency’s science budget largely unaffected for the fiscal year of 2026 — which technically started in October, as the chaos has dragged on.

It’s a major test of Isaacman’s leadership after taking control of an agency in crisis last month. Insiders remain highly skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. They say NASA should be opening doors, not closing them, especially as the United States looks to return astronauts to the Moon in the coming years.

“Where is the consolidation?” Biggs wrote. “The material is not being consolidated with other holdings; it is simply being lost to Goddard and to the broader research community, much of it is being sent to storage or to the dumpster.”

“NASA’s scientists and engineers shouldn’t have to be dumpster divers to do their work,” he added. “We expect better from NASA and its managers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stuffed with cargo carried a brand new NASA telescope into space, where it was observed deploying in Sun-synchronous orbit, the agency later confirmed.

Dubbed Pandora, the orbital observatory is designed to hunt for distant worlds called exoplanets orbiting other stars. And though not nearly as large or expensive as the James Webb Space Telescope, the 17-inch lens packs a specialized punch that’ll help astronomers do something that was unthinkable just a decade or two ago: glean clues from individual exoplanets too remote for even the mighty Webb to pick up on.

Pandora’s mission will last a year, during which it’s expected to complete observations of at least 20 exoplanets — as well, in a novel development, of the stars they orbit.

This will “shatter a barrier,” according to University of Arizona astronomer Daniel Apai, whose team helped build the telescope — helping “remove a source of noise in the data that limits our ability to study small exoplanets in detail and search for life on them,” he wrote in a new piece for The Conversation.

Exoplanets are incredibly difficult to find, and even harder to study. Look up into the night sky, and you will effortlessly spot millions of stars. The first exoplanet, in contrast, wasn’t confirmed until 1992; to this day, astronomers have found only around 6,000 planets around other stars, a task hindered because the little-if-any light they reflect is blown out by that of nearby stars.

To espy distant worlds, astronomers look for when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective. This is called a transit, and it produces a noticeable dip in the starlight. What’s more, astronomers can analyze the light to tease out properties of the planet it passes through, like the chemicals in its atmosphere. Apai, who is also co-investigator of Pandora, compares this to holding a glass of wine up to a candle: “The light filtering through will show fine details that reveal the quality of the wine.”

Likewise, “by analyzing starlight filtered through the planets’ atmospheres,” he continued, “astronomers can find evidence for water vapor, hydrogen, clouds and even search for evidence of life.”

Astronomers have relied on this clever trick for decades, but recent research, some of it spearheaded by Apai and his colleagues, has shown that it can have a serious flaw. Cooler, volatile regions on the surface of stars, called starspots, can fudge the signals astronomers see, even tricking them into mistaking the water vapor around a star for being present on the planet. Essentially, “we were trying to judge our wine in light of flickering, unstable candles,” Apai said.

That’s where Pandora comes in. Being purpose-built for exoplanet hunting, it can spend far more time observing them than Webb, whose precious time is always in hot demand. Even better, Pandora will observe the stars themselves for 24 hours at a time with infrared and visible light sensors, closely monitoring how the starspots form and evolve. Over the course of its year-long mission, the telescope will revisit each star ten times, racking up hundreds of hours of observations.

“With that information, our Pandora team will be able to figure out how the changes in the stars affect the observed planetary transits,” Apai wrote.

            <div id="article-text">In less time than it takes to get bored of your new year’s resolution, the planet’s wealthiest people had already blown through their yearly ration of carbon emissions.

We’re not speaking figuratively, either. A new analysis by the Oxfam Foundation found that the world’s richest 1 percent exceeded their fair share of annual carbon emissions just 10 days into the year.

The global “carbon budget” is based off the amount of carbon dioxide that humankind can collectively spew while keeping us within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. According to Oxfam, the CO2 emissions of the richest 1 percent in just one year will result in an estimated 1.3 million heat-related deaths by the end of the 21st century.

“To stay within the 1.5 degrees limit, the richest 1 percent would have to slash their emissions by 97 percent by 2030,” the study’s press release reads.

Meanwhile, it only took the top 0.1 percent until January 3rd to use up their allotment. Another recent Oxfam report using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute found that the richest 0.1 percent of individuals produce more CO2 pollution in a day than the poorest 50 percent do in a year.

“If everyone emitted like the richest 0.1 percent, the carbon budget would be used up in less than three weeks,” Oxfam implores.

These outrageous figures aren’t just a measure of individual consumption, but of economic power. Since 2024, the top 1 percent has owned more wealth than 95 percent of humanity — not just in cash, but through ownership of powerful assets like mega-corporations and real estate holdings.

The real issue, in other words, isn’t finger wagging about individual consumer choices. The global economy has been built around a vast over-consumption that’s rapidly leading the planet into ecological catastrophe, and the world’s wealthiest are profiting massively. In 2019 for example, an analysis by The Guardian found that just20 fossil fuel companies were responsible for 35 percent of all CO2 and methane pollution since 1965.

Staving off environmental collapse, in other words, will require a difficult confrontation with some of the world’s richest people and the powerful corporations that built their fortunes.

“Time and time again, the research shows that governments have a very clear and simple route to drastically slash carbon emissions and tackle inequality: by targeting the richest polluters,” said Oxfam’s climate change policy lead, Nafkote Dabi. “By cracking down on the gross carbon recklessness of the super-rich, global leaders have an opportunity to put the world back on track for climate targets and unlock net benefits for people and the planet.”

            <div id="article-text">Monkeys are incredible escape artists, known to break out of research labs and even trucks that crashed on the highway.

Private enclosures are also no match for the dexterous and scheming simians. Last week, multiple Vervet monkeys, which are native to sub-Saharan Africa, were spotted roaming the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, alarming officials.

Nobody knows how many of them there are, or where they even came from. It’s also illegal to own Vervet monkeys in the city, so if they’re escaped pets, the owner may not own up to having lost them.

“This is the first time we’ve had a situation dealing with monkeys at large in the city of St. Louis,” Department of Health environmental bureau chief Justen Hauser told NBC News-affiliate KSDK on January 9.

But besides the innate challenges of capturing the agile mammals — as well as an escaped goat also on the loose in the Mound City — the St. Louis Department of Health is being frustrated by a novel hindrance: generative AI slop.

As the Associated Press reports, AI-generated images are complicating rescue efforts because residents have been posting fake images online, claiming to have spotted the monkeys.

“It’s been a lot in regard to AI and what’s genuine and what’s not,” city Department of Health spokesperson Willie Springer told the AP. “People are just having fun. Like, I don’t think anyone means harm.”

AI-generated images circulating on X-formerly-Twitter show the monkeys joining a local gang and hanging out on the stoop. Another shows them drinking out of 40-ounce malt liquor bottles.

While many of the images were intended as a joke, AI-based image generators have advanced to the point where they could easily come up with realistic-looking images of escaped monkeys as well, leading officials on a goose chase.

Springer admitted that they don’t even know how many monkeys are on the loose, saying that there could be up to four of them.

“Original reports suggested there were four animals, but we cannot confirm an actual number at this time, only that there is more than one,” Hauser told the BBC.

Experts at the St. Louis Zoo have since joined the efforts, warning that residents should leave the monkeys alone.

“The monkeys can be intelligent but also unpredictable at times,” Hauser told KSDK last week.

Apart from complicating escaped monkey rescue efforts, generative AI has already turned into a major headache for officials. Case in point, police were forced to issue a warning in October after kids started sending their parents AI-manipulated pictures of them welcoming homeless men into their houses.

            <h2>New York governor clears path for robotaxis everywhere, with one notable exception</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/new-york-governor-clears-path-for-robotaxis-everywhere-with-one-notable-exception/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York Governor Kathy Hochul plans to introduce legislation that would effectively legalize robotaxis in the state — except for its most populous metropolis: New York City.

Hochul, who made the comments Tuesday during her State of the State address, said the legislation would advance the next phase of the state’s autonomous vehicle pilot program.

Details on the proposed legislation and when it might be released are thin. However, there are some hints contained within a document that outlines an array of proposals and promises Hochul made in her State of the State address.

Among them is language to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.”

The document goes on to say companies that want to operate robotaxi services commercially will have to submit applications that “demonstrate local support for AV deployment and adherence to the highest possible safety standards.”

It’s not clear what “limited deployment” or “highest possible safety standards” mean. Nor does the document outline how the state will track or make judgments on a company’s safety record, except that multiple agencies will be involved, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, and New York State Police.

The governor’s office told TechCrunch more will be shared in the governor’s executive budget proposal that is set to be released on January 20.

Still, the remarks were enough of an opening to make Alphabet-owned Waymo cheer.

“Governor Hochul’s proposal to legalize fully autonomous vehicles is a transformative moment for New York’s transportation system,” Justin Kintz, Waymo’s head of global public policy, said in an emailed statement.

“With the Governor’s leadership, New York has the opportunity to pair its investments in slower speeds, better traffic enforcement, and first-in-the-nation congestion management strategies with Waymo’s demonstrably safe technology, creating a future where living in New York is safer, easier, and more accessible. We’re ready to work with leaders around the state to make this future a reality, and bring new infrastructure, career opportunities, and investment to the Empire State,” said Kintz.

Waymo and other companies have tried for years to enter New York state with limited success. Current New York state law mandates that drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That poses a problem for robotaxi operators like Waymo since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.

The state’s AV pilot program has provided an exemption to that rule, theoretically allowing companies to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state.

Still, there are significant hurdles, particularly in New York City. Last August, city regulators granted a permit to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the densely populated city. Under that permit, Waymo can deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the permit has been extended until March 31.

Even with the permit, Waymo can’t carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission.

And while legislation was introduced last year to create a framework for driverless operation, it has languished in the state Senate’s transportation committee. The governor’s proposal could help loosen that bottleneck.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/microsoft-announces-glut-of-new-data-centers-but-says-it-wont-let-your-electricity-bill-go-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.

Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.

On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.

“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”

The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.

It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.

This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.

Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”

In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/a-consumer-watchdog-issued-a-warning-about-googles-ai-agent-shopping-protocol-google-says-shes-wrong/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.

In a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”

Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.

She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.

After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.

In a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”

In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.

Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”

The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.

Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.

She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”

Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.

While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.

The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.

That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.

Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ammonia might be the world’s most underappreciated chemical. Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.

Humans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, Ammobia, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.

To prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.

If the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer.

Ammonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to decarbonize a range of industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t as energy dense and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.

“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”

But those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases.

To make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH4) found in natural gas.

Ammobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.

The startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.

That could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.

Ammobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each.

Because Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.

“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”

The reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.

Ammobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a patent pending on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including manganese nitride, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.

The startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.

“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What does it take to bring a burned-out founder back to the company he sold to Amazon? For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.

Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal shipped just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” conversational AI, facial recognition features, and more. Some of these additions have not been without controversy, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.

“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.”

By 2023, five years after selling Ring to Amazon, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he needed out. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”

When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans.

Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform.

“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, destroying the garage where Ring was built.

One of Ring’s new additions, Fire Watch, was inspired by this tragedy. In partnership with the nonprofit fire monitoring organization Watch Duty, Ring customers will be able to opt in to share footage when a massive fire event happens, allowing the organization to build a better map that can be used to help deploy firefighting resources more efficiently. The AI will be used in that case to look for smoke, fire, embers, and more in the shared footage.

Another recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected.

“I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match.

Other moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.

Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage.

“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.

He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.

“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.”

Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target.

Another AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator.

The facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely.

Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention.

He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it.

“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.”

But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/man-to-plead-guilty-to-hacking-us-supreme-court-filing-system/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A resident of Springfield, Tennessee, is expected to plead guilty to hacking the U.S. Supreme Court’s electronic document filing system dozens of times over several months.

Prosecutors say between August and October 2023, Nicholas Moore, 24, “intentionally accessed a computer without authorization on 25 different days and thereby obtained information from a protected computer,” according to a court document.

As of this writing, there aren’t any more details about exactly what information Moore accessed, nor how it was accessed. Moore is scheduled to plead guilty in court by video link on Friday.

When reached, a spokesperson for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which brought the charges against Moore, told TechCrunch that prosecutors cannot provide any more information that hasn’t already been made public.

Spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information about the case.

Moore’s lawyer, Eugene Ohm, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The case was first spotted by Court Watch’s Seamus Hughes, a researcher and journalist who monitors court documents.

This is one of several occasions in recent years in which hackers have compromised U.S. court systems. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which oversees the federal judiciary, said in August that it had strengthened its cybersecurity defenses following a cyberattack on its electronic court records system.

Hackers working for the Russian government were blamed for the breach.

            <h2>MAGA Thinks Maduro Will Prove Trump Won in 2020</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/maduro-venezuela-conspiracy-theory/685599/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the days after American commandos raided Nicolás Maduro’s compound and whisked him out of Venezuela, Mike Lindell wasn’t ruminating about the dramatic military operation or oil prices—he was reviving a long-dead conspiracy theory.

Lindell, better known as the “MyPillow guy,” was celebrating because, in his telling, a possible witness to the theory that Venezuela conspired with election-equipment companies to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump was now in U.S. custody. “I’m hoping now that Maduro will actually come clean and tell us everything about the machines and how they steal the elections,” Lindell, who has long espoused election falsehoods, told me the day after the Venezuelan dictator’s arraignment.

The supposition boils down to this: Venezuela plotted with election-equipment and -technology companies to engineer Trump’s defeat in 2020. There is no credible evidence to support this. But with Maduro in U.S. custody months before the midterms and the Trump administration investigating the 2020 election, an idea that had been disproved by facts and debunked in lawsuits has been revived, with a newsy twist: Now Maduro will prove from a New York jail that Trump defeated Joe Biden.

Since Maduro’s capture, Trump has shared a raft of discredited election-fraud claims on his Truth Social site, including one tied to a company central to the Venezuela conspiracy. A top Justice Department official helped harden the narrative: Ed Martin, the United States pardon attorney (who also directs the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group, which pursues retribution against Trump’s perceived political enemies), promoted the idea that Maduro could offer crucial information to substantiate the stolen-election theory once and for all. Martin reposted on X a claim that Maduro could try “to plead to lesser charges by proffering evidence that the 2020 election was stolen,” adding “!”

The right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, an extremely online Trump-administration ally, claimed that Maduro “is in possession” of evidence against election-equipment companies. “Maduro might be Trump’s final revenge for the election theft of 2020,” Johnson told his audience. “If he begins to sing like a canary—which he will; they always do—then who will he give up?” Johnson added: “This is why they took him alive.”

The conspiracy theory traces back to the days after the 2020 election. Trump allies, including his lawyers at the time Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, claimed that Trump had been denied a win because two voting-equipment companies, Dominion Voting Systems (which was sold last year and is operating under the name Liberty Vote) and Smartmatic, had flipped votes for Biden. The systems and software, Powell said at the time, were “created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chávez to make sure he never lost an election.”

Powell and Giuliani settled lawsuits with Dominion over election falsehoods. (The settlement details are confidential.) Smartmatic has reached legal settlements with right-leaning media outlets over false statements about the company. One of them, Newsmax, wrote on its website last year that “it has no evidence that Smartmatic machines or software altered the votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.” It continued: “Smartmatic is a U.S. company not owned by the Venezuelan government, or any foreign official or entity.”

Smartmatic also won a defamation case last year against Lindell. That hasn’t stopped him from reviving claims of a stolen election after Maduro’s apprehension. Lindell told me last week that he had turned “a book” that he compiled about the 2020 election (Lindell also told me he’s “sure” it includes versions of the theory that Venezuela helped steal it) over to federal officials. He would not say who, specifically, but said he hoped that the Justice Department and other federal authorities were investigating. Lindell predicted that he, Powell (who could not be reached for comment), and many others would be vindicated. “I’m hoping now that Maduro will actually come clean,” he told me, “and tell all about the machines and how they steal the elections.”

The Venezuelan-voting-machine conspiracy theory has returned as the Trump administration is using the government to investigate a valid election whose outcome the president didn’t like. (Trump apparently harbors regrets for not doing more to overturn the results, telling The New York Times that “I should have” had the National Guard seize voting machines in 2020.) The Guardian reported in November that federal investigators were interviewing people who were claiming that Venezuela had helped rob Trump of a win. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said during a Cabinet meeting last April that investigators had “evidence of how these electronic voting systems have been vulnerable to hackers for a very long time.” At an August Cabinet meeting, Trump asked Gabbard if she had found information tied to “how corrupt the 2020 election was. When will that all come out?” Gabbard responded that she would brief Trump once she had all of the information, adding, “We are finding documents literally tucked away in the back of safes and random offices.”

The administration has also been attempting to access local voting equipment. A Department of Homeland Security official, with the help of a political operative, unsuccessfully sought access last year to vote-counting machines in Colorado, but county clerks rebuffed the requests to examine the tightly controlled equipment. Two GOP clerks in Missouri also rejected requests from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to examine their machines. And Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who challenged Trump’s 2020 loss in court, was tapped last fall to probe that election as a special government employee, The Wall Street Journal reported. Olsen has told people he wants, among other things, to examine equipment used during the 2020 election, according to the Journal. (Olsen didn’t respond to the Journal’s request for comment or one I left with him.)

The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me that Trump wants to ensure the U.S. has safe and secure elections and that he has long said Maduro “was an illegitimate, narco-terrorist.” In response to Trump’s election-related executive order last March (titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections”), she said the Department of Homeland Security is preparing a report on the cybersecurity of election systems and “will deliver that report shortly.&quot; (The Department of Justice, Liberty Vote, and Smartmatic did not return my requests for comment.)

Election administrators around the country who have been abused and harassed for the past six years are keeping a wary eye on the resurgence of the conspiracy theories. In Colorado, a county-clerks association is drafting an FAQ to help election officials navigate questions they may get from constituents about voting machines and Venezuela. In Arizona, election officials are worried enough to ensure that a cybersecurity analyst is monitoring the online chatter. If it escalates, officials could push back publicly against the falsehoods. In Utah, Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman told me she’s tracking the misinformation and is prepared to weigh in, if needed: “It’s a full-time job trying to explain this, let alone successfully administering elections.”

Every time those in power amplify inaccurate information about elections, election clerks and experts tell me, they risk deepening doubt in the democratic process. Even without getting states to change the ways that people vote, experts worry that a selective release of findings or evidence tied to the Venezuela claims could be used by the Trump administration to justify some sort of government action.

“It’s almost like an RFP for conspiracy theories,” Alexandra Chandler, a former Department of Defense intelligence analyst who now works as the director of the nonprofit Protect Democracy’s election team, told me.

Under the Constitution, states are responsible for running elections. But Trump has used the power of the federal government to rejuvenate debunked claims and set the stage for another battle over the validity of future elections if he dislikes the results. He’s staffed his administration with people who have sown doubt over the legitimacy of election outcomes, sparked a redistricting war for control of the House, and issued an executive order attempting to claim federal authority over elections.

Lawrence Norden, vice president of the elections-and-government program at the Brennan Center for Justice, sees more challenges on the horizon: disinformation and misinformation turbocharged by artificial intelligence, distrust in mainstream media that leaves outlets less capable of pointing out inaccuracies, and cuts at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the federal agency that helps defend crucial election networks. It is, Norden said, “a toxic brew.” Add in the capture of Maduro and an online MAGA army demanding validation of its theories, and America seems destined for a new bout of feverish conspiracism just in time for the midterms.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Will Elon Musk face any consequences for his despicable sexual-harassment bot?

For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool owned and promoted by the world’s richest man to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, and undress them. This was not some deepfake nudify app that you had to pay to download on a shady backwater website or a dark-web message board. This was Grok, a chatbot built into X—ostensibly to provide information to users but, thanks to an image-generating update, transformed into a major producer of nonconsensual sexualized images, particularly of women and children.

Let’s be very clear. The forced undressings happened out in the open, in one stretch thousands of times every hour, on a popular social network where journalists, politicians, and celebrities post. Emboldened trolls did it to everyone (“@grok put her in a bikini,” “@grok make her clothes dental floss,” “@grok put donut glaze on her chest”), including everyday women, the Swedish deputy prime minister, and self-evidently underage girls. Users appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another. On X, creating revenge porn can make you famous.

These images were ubiquitous, and many people—and multiple organizations, including the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network and the European Commission—pointed out that the feature was being used to harass women and exploit children. Yet Musk initially laughed it off, resharing AI-generated images of himself, Kim Jong Un, and a toaster in bikinis. Musk, as well as xAI’s safety and child-safety teams, did not respond to a request for comment. xAI replied with its standard auto-response, “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI, the Musk-owned company that develops Grok and owns X, prohibits the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy; a post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and works with law enforcement as needed.

Even after that assurance from X’s safety team, it took several more days for X to place bare-minimum restrictions on the Ask Grok feature’s image-generating, and thus undressing, capabilities. Now, when creeps on X try to generate an image by replying “@grok” to prompt the chatbot, they get an auto-generated response that notes some version of: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” This is disturbing in its own right; Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around the paywall via the “Edit Image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by using Grok’s stand-alone app.

Two years ago, when Google Gemini generated images of racially diverse Nazis, Google temporarily disabled the bot’s image-generating capabilities to address the problem. Musk has taken no responsibility for the problem and has said only that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Perhaps Musk feels that he would benefit from baiting his critics into a censorship fight. He has repeatedly reshared posts that frame calls to regulate or ban his platform in response to the Grok undressing as leftist censorship, for instance reposting a meme calling such efforts “retarded” as well as a Grok-generated video of a woman applying lipstick captioned with a quote commonly attributed to Marilyn Monroe: “We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it’s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.” Last week, as Musk’s chatbot was generating likely hundreds of thousands of these images, we reached out directly to X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, who didn’t reply. Within the hour, Rosemarie Esposito, X’s media-strategy lead, emailed us unprompted with her contact information, in case we had “any questions” in the future. We asked her a series of questions about the tool and how X could allow such a thing to operate. She did not reply.

We’ve reached out multiple times to more than a dozen key investors listed in xAI’s two most recent public fundraising rounds—the latest of which, announced during this Grok-enabled sexual-harassment spree, valued the company at about $230 billion—to ask if they endorsed the use of X and Grok to generate and distribute nonconsensual sexualized images. These investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Management & Research Company, the Saudi firm Kingdom Holding Company, and the state-owned investment firms of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. We asked whether they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products and, if yes, why they felt justified in continuing to invest in a company that has enabled the public sexual harassment of women and exploitation of children on the internet. BlackRock, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Baron Capital declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley initially told us that she could find no documentation that the company is a major investor in xAI. After we sent a public announcement from xAI that lists Morgan Stanley as a key investor in its Series C fundraising round, the spokesperson did not answer our questions. The other companies did not respond.

We also reached out to several companies that provide the infrastructure for X and Grok—in other words, that allow these products to exist on the internet: Google and Apple, which offer both X and Grok on their app stores; Microsoft and Oracle, which run Grok on their cloud services; and Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok. We asked if they endorsed the use of these products to create nonconsensual sexual images of women and children, and whether they would take steps to prevent this from continuing. None responded except for Microsoft, which told us that it does not provide cloud services, chips, or hosting services for xAI other than offering the Grok language model—without image generation—on its enterprise platform, Microsoft Foundry.

As all of this unfolded, xAI made several major announcements: new Grok products for businesses; upgraded video-generating capabilities; that enormous fundraising round. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX’s headquarters in Texas and joined Musk for a press conference in which Hegseth said, “I want to thank you, Elon, and your incredible team” for bringing Grok to the military. (Later this year, Grok will join Google Gemini on a new Pentagon platform called GenAI.mil that the Defense Department says will offer advanced AI tools to military and civilian personnel.) We asked the DOD if it endorsed xAI’s sexualized material or if it would reconsider its partnership with the company in response. In a statement, a Pentagon official told us only that the department’s policy on the use of AI “fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations” and that “any unlawful activity” by its personnel “will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.”

Government bodies in the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union have said that they will investigate X, while Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok, but Musk appears to be unfazed by these efforts—and also seems to be receiving help in brushing them off. Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, has said that, should the U.K. ban X, America “has a full range of tools that we can use to facilitate uncensored internet access in authoritarian, closed societies.”

At the moment, Musk seems to be not only getting away with this but also reveling in it. Although governments appear to be furious at Musk, they also seem impotent. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the TAKE IT DOWN Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last Wednesday that the Grok-generated images “are unacceptable and a clear violation of” the law but that he was “encouraged that X has announced that they’re taking these violations seriously.” Throughout that same day, Grok continued to comply with user requests to undress people. Yesterday, Cruz posted on X a photo of himself with his arm around Musk and the caption “Always great seeing this guy 🚀.”

And it’s already beginning to feel as if the scandal—the world’s richest man enabling the widespread harassment of women and children—is waning, crowded out by a new year of relentless news cycles. But this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet. Grok’s ability to undress minors is not, as Musk might have you think, an exercise in free-speech maximalism. It is, however, a speech issue: By turning sexual harassment and revenge porn into a meme with viral distribution, the platform is allowing its worst, most vindictive users to silence and intimidate anyone they desire. The retaliation on X has been obvious—women who’ve stood up in opposition to the tool have been met with anonymous trolls asking Grok to put them in a bikini.

Social platforms have long leaned on the argument that they aren’t subject to the same defamation laws as publishers and media companies. But this latest debacle, Musk’s reaction, and the silence from so many of X’s investors and peer companies were all active choices—and symptoms of a broader crisis of impunity that’s begun to seep into American culture. They were the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs bowing to Donald Trump. Of financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors such as cryptocurrency and meme stocks—a braggadocious, “get the bag” ethos that has no room for greed or shame. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences. Few industries have been as brazen in their capitulation as Big Tech, which has dismantled its content-moderation systems to please the current administration. It’s a cynical and cowardly pivot, one that allows companies to continue to profit off harassment and extremism without worrying about the consequences of their actions.

Deepfakes are not new, but xAI has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before. By matching viral distribution with this type of image creation, xAI has built a way to spread AI revenge porn and child-sexual-abuse material at scale. The end result is desensitizing: The sheer amount of exploitative content flooding the platform may eventually make the revolting, illicit images appear “normal.” Arguably, this process is already happening.

The internet has always been a chaotic place where trolls can seize outsize power. Historically, that chaos has been constrained by platforms doing the bare minimum to protect their users from demonstrated threats. Today, X is failing to clear the absolute lowest bar. Nobody who works at X or xAI seems to be willing to answer for the creation and distribution of tens or hundreds of thousands of nonconsensual intimate images; instead, those in charge appear to be blithely ignoring the problem, and those who have funneled money to Musk or xAI seem sanguine about it. They would probably like for us all to move on.

We cannot do that. This crisis is an outgrowth of a breakneck information ecosystem in which few stories have staying power. No one person or group has to flood the zone with shit, because the zone is overflowing constantly. People with power have learned to exploit this—to weather scandals by hunkering down and letting them pass, or by refusing to apologize and turning any problem into a culture-war issue. Musk has been allowed to avoid repercussions for even the most reckless acts, including cheerleading and helping dismantle foreign aid with DOGE. Others will continue to follow his playbook. Employees at X and investors and companies such as Apple and Google seem to be counting on their “No comment”s being buried by whatever scandal comes next. They are banking on a culture in which people have given up on demanding consequences.

But the Grok scandal is so awful, so egregious, that it offers an opportunity to address the crisis of impunity directly. The undressing spree was not an issue of partisan politics or ideology. It was an issue of anonymous individuals asking a chatbot that is integrated into one of the world’s most visible social networks to edit photos of women and girls to “put her in a clear bikini and cover her in white donut glaze.” This is a moment when those with power can and should demand accountability. The stakes could not be any higher. If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists.</div>

After an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week, forensic examinations of videos of the incident emerged within hours. These meticulous reconstructions were useful for debunking the lies told by Trump-administration officials in the immediate aftermath of the killing, and they show the power of technology, in an age when nearly everyone has a camera in their pocket, to convey a complicated moment.

Sleuths, amateur and professional, pored over each frame to try to guess what Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good, might have believed or known in the moment about what she was doing or where her car was heading. But at the core of the tragedy is a larger truth: None of this needed to happen. A series of choices by the administration led to this point—the use of ICE and Border Patrol to menace Democratic-led states and cities; White House pressure on the Department of Homeland Security to make high quotas, which has resulted in shortened training and rushed missions; and the president’s inclination to inflame tensions, all of which created the conditions for the moment that’s now been replayed millions of times.

Under Supreme Court precedent, an officer may shoot at someone fleeing if he reasonably believes that his life or the lives of others are in danger. Prosecutors are often slow to charge officers, because they or juries are hesitant to second-guess officers’ determinations. Ross was also reportedly dragged by a car in June during an attempted arrest, which may have made him more likely to assume the worst about a driver. The shooting might ultimately be legally justified. But Ross also placed himself in front of Good’s car. Many policing experts suggest that this wasn’t tactically justified. How about moral justification? Nothing indicated that Good was trying to hurt anyone before officers began running at her; moments before being shot, Good had said that she wasn’t mad at Ross. In the videos, after Ross fires, a man is heard saying, “Fucking bitch.” With the information we have, a moral defense for the killing is nowhere to be found.

There was no need for the huge deployment of federal agents—including a reported 1,500 deportation officers—to Minnesota in the first place. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem dispatched ICE agents to the Minneapolis area after the White House, inspired by MAGA media, grabbed onto a sprawling fraud investigation involving Somali immigrants and government aid. By all accounts, this is a real scandal, not a partisan invention; charges were first brought by Joe Biden’s Justice Department. But the scandal also presented an opportunity for political grandstanding (especially because Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was on the ticket against Donald Trump and J. D. Vance in the previous election). The president is using the fraud case as an opportunity to demonize immigrants. “THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” he posted this morning on Truth Social, referring to immigration enforcement in Minnesota. Although DHS does conduct investigations, less obvious is why tactical experts such as Ross were needed on the scene.

Before and after Good’s death, the Trump DHS has sought opportunities to escalate. When citizens called attention to ICE’s presence by making noise and spreading word via social media, DHS falsely claimed that those people were violent rioters. After Good’s death, DHS surged more officers to the area, alleging that the fraud situation merited more agents; officers are now conducting traffic stops and door-to-door operations. But Good’s killing has no obvious connection to fraud, and it does not suggest any elevated threat to officers. Instead, the presence of more officers elevates the threat to civilians, as a Wall Street Journal investigation into ICE traffic stops demonstrates.

Pressure from the White House to meet deportation quotas has meant that ICE agents at best are working hastily and at worst feel unshackled to act with brutality, aware that they are unlikely to face discipline. (Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned today, including the leader of the Somali-fraud investigation, because of the Justice Department’s direction to investigate Good’s widow but not Ross.) This, too, increases the likelihood for mistakes and abuses of power.

The Minnesota actions are, of course, only the latest in a string of similar Trump-administration actions targeting cities that vote Democratic: Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; Memphis; Charlotte, North Carolina; New Orleans. The administration has used DHS personnel, the National Guard, and, in L.A., Marines. Trump and his aides have argued that these raids are essential for controlling crime and illegal immigration, but sometimes enforcement seems incidental to performative brutality. In one midnight raid at a Chicago building, for example, the federal government flew a Black Hawk helicopter and turned people out of bed with flash-bang grenades, yet ProPublica found that not a single one of the people arrested was charged with a crime afterward.

Trump ended National Guard deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland late last year, bowing to repeated federal-court rulings, in lawsuits brought by cities and states, that establish that he had exceeded his powers. The first two weeks of January suggest that the administration will simply use DHS to serve the same function of punishing and intimidating cities and states that diverge from Trump politically. Minnesota and Illinois officials sued to block some immigration enforcement yesterday, but because immigration enforcement is a standard federal power, these suits may face longer odds.

Even unfettered, however, the White House is unlikely to achieve its goals of deporting all unauthorized immigrants—in part because they are based on wild overestimates of how many people are in the United States illegally. But Trump and the top aide Stephen Miller’s obsession with the issue means more incidents like Renee Good’s killing. A one-off tragedy is horrifying. What’s worse is when policy choices make it likely to happen again.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

To be an enrolled member of a tribe is almost entirely contingent on “blood quantum”—the percentage of one’s lineage that can be traced to tribal ancestors.

I don’t qualify for enrollment in my tribe. To be enrolled in the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, you need a quantum of one-quarter Minnesota Chippewa Tribe blood, as well as one parent who is an enrolled member. (Chippewa is a French corruption of the original Ojibwe.) Even though my mother grew up on Leech Lake and devoted her life to the tribe, first as a nurse and then as a lawyer and tribal-court judge, her official blood quantum is only one-quarter. Her grandmother was recorded as half Ojibwe, even though she was full, and her father was on the rolls as a quarter when he was really half. I should be enrolled. The fact that I should be but am not turned the idea of Native blood into an obsession for me, at least for a while, because it was a measure of my Indianness that I couldn’t change.

Watch. Black Swan, released 15 years ago, offers a sharp social critique of the pitfalls faced by ambitious women, Faith Hill writes.

Read. Gideon Leek explores the unhappy literary families of the internet age.

New tidbits continue to emerge from The New York Times’ lengthy interview with Trump, and one in particular caught my eye. In my December cover story about how Trump and his allies could seek to subvert the midterm elections, I reported on the danger of the executive branch attempting to seize ballot boxes. This isn’t just catastrophizing: Some Trump allies proposed such a plan after the 2020 election, but it was rejected. In the Times interview, the reporter David Sanger asked Trump about that. “Well, I should have,” Trump replied. Americans should be prepared for him to try again when he has a chance.

            <h2>Texas Sends Plato Back to His Cave</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/texas-censorship-plato-philosophy-sexuality/685597/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thomas Jefferson loathed Plato. In 1814, he wrote to John Adams that he had been reading the Republic and came away unimpressed: “Bringing Plato to the test of reason, take from him his sophisms, futilities, & incomprehensibilities, and what remains?” The only reason the Greek philosopher is so revered, Jefferson opined, is that “education is chiefly in the hands of persons who, from their profession, have an interest in the reputation and the dreams of Plato.”

Even so, Jefferson would have been appalled by what happened last week at Texas A&M University. Days before the spring semester began, Martin Peterson, a philosophy professor, was ordered to remove Plato’s Symposium from the list of assigned readings for the class “Contemporary Moral Issues.” Peterson and Plato fell victim to a policy adopted by the university in the fall, which states that classes cannot “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” without special approval.

In his email response to his department chair, Inside Higher Ed reported, Peterson warned, “You are making Texas A&M famous—but not for the right reasons.” He was right. The case has attracted widespread outrage, including a protest from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. It’s hard to imagine a starker violation of academic freedom than forbidding students to read one of the most famous texts in all of Western philosophy. “Your decision to bar a philosophy professor from teaching Plato is unprecedented,” Peterson protested.

Tyler Austin Harper: The humanities have sown the seeds of their own destruction

But although this kind of censorship may be absurd and sinister, it is ironically fitting that Plato, of all philosophers, should be targeted by a regime worried about the effect of subversive ideas on tender minds. Almost 2,500 years ago, Plato’s teacher, Socrates, was sentenced to death by the city of Athens for exactly the same reason.

“What do they say? Something of this sort: That Socrates is a doer of evil, and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state.” That is how the charges against him are described in the Apology, one of Plato’s early works, which reports or imagines the speech Socrates delivered in his defense at his trial. He warns his fellow citizens about “the evil name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed Socrates, a wise man.”

The fate of Socrates convinced Plato that the conflict between philosophy and society was inevitable—especially in a democracy, where public opinion is sacred. In the parable of the cave, in the Republic, Plato compares human beings to cave dwellers who never see the sun, but perceive everything by shadowy firelight. Only the philosopher is able to escape the cave and see the way things really are. But when he returns to share what he’s discovered, and tries to get the others to leave the cave too, they laugh at him, or worse: “If they were somehow able to get their hands on and kill the man who attempts to release and lead up, wouldn’t they kill him?” Socrates asks. “No doubt about it,” replies his conversation partner, Glaucon (who in real life was Plato’s older brother).

The Enlightenment began to challenge this pessimistic view in the 18th century. Jefferson was naturally hostile to Plato’s elitism: If all men are created equal, as the Declaration of Independence said, then everyone should be able to understand the truth, once the weight of authority and tradition is lifted from their shoulders.

In the 20th century, the idea that democracy and freedom of thought went hand in hand began to seem doubtful. Leo Strauss, one of Plato’s most important modern interpreters, was a refugee from Nazi Germany, where the banning and burning of subversive books was extremely popular, especially with college students. The idea that seeking the truth was dangerous, that being a philosopher meant courting popular fury, no longer sounded so antique.

In his 1964 book, The City and Man, Strauss wrote that, for Plato, cities are “assemblies of madmen which corrupt most of those fit to become philosophers, and to which those who have succeeded against all odds in becoming philosophers rightly turn their backs in disgust.” This enmity has existed in most times and places, requiring philosophers to exercise what Strauss called “prudence”—that is, to protect themselves by concealing their most explosively unconventional ideas. Strauss believed that many great philosophers had employed “esoteric writing,” only hinting at their true teachings in their published work, to avoid angering the powers that be.

For most of history, the really dangerous philosophical ideas were those that touched on religion and political power. But the Platonic text censored at Texas A&M is not about these subjects, at least not directly. Rather, the Symposium deals with sex and love. Peterson intended to assign the passage in which Plato elaborates on a myth about the origin of erotic love, proposing that human beings were originally created as bodies joined together. Some of these pairs included two men, some two women, and some a man and a woman. But Zeus cut these doubles in half, and ever since our souls have longed to reunite with their lost mate.

This explains why some people are what we now call homosexual: Their souls were originally part of a same-sex pair. Plato writes that if Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge, appeared to a male couple and offered “to melt you into one and let you grow together, so that being two you shall become one, and while you live, live a common life as if you were a single man,” the lovers would certainly agree: “This meeting and melting into one another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of his ancient need.”

The Symposium’s sympathetic depiction of same-sex desire—at least between men; no female characters take part in the discussion—has long made Plato what we’d now call “queer-coded.” The Victorian writer John Addington Symonds spoke for many a gay reader when he described the thrill of reading Plato for the first time: “Here in the Phaedrus and the Symposium, I discovered the true Liber Amoris [Book of Love] at last, the revelation I had been waiting for.”

Yet the Symposium insists that erotic desire is not really about sex. What we yearn for is not this or that beautiful body, but the beautiful itself, an ideal that can be found only in the spiritual realm. Plato suggests that this is especially true of love between men, which transcends biology because it doesn’t lead to procreation. Symonds said he found in the Symposium “the consecration of a long-cherished idealism.”

Aziz Huq: The next era of the American university

It’s highly unlikely that the Texas A&M regents read Plato before drafting their policy. If they had, they would have discovered that, far from “advocating gender ideology,” he challenges all of our 21st-century ways of thinking about sex and gender. He is neither “left” nor “right,” because he lived thousands of years before those labels were invented. That is one of the reasons studying Greek philosophy has never become obsolete: In every generation, it allows people to escape the binaries of their own time and think things through from the beginning.

The belief that every student is capable of this kind of thinking, and deserves to experience it, was one of the noblest ideals of democratic education. Now that both democracy and education are under threat in the United States, philosophers may have to relearn the “prudence” that once seemed like a relic of history. Peterson is already employing a classic technique of esoteric writing: calling attention to what he is forced to omit. In his revised syllabus, when the students were originally supposed to read Plato, they will now be assigned a New York Times article about why they can’t.</div>

Welcome back to Atlantic Trivia! Are you hungry for more?

I hope that while I’ve been away, you have been enjoying plenty of food for thought—literally. Research shows that berries help improve memory and that a walnut-heavy diet is associated with higher cognitive performance. Fatty fish and leafy greens are linked to slower cognitive decline. Caffeine is a brain boost too.

A challenge: Combine all these ingredients, Chopped-style, into the perfect pre-trivia meal.

Meanwhile, I have been away these past few weeks thinking mostly about chicken parmigiana. It’s not brain food per se, but I reckon we can call it creativity fuel—so long as it’s eaten for breakfast. That is the suggestion in the first edition of my new newsletter, Better With Time, an eight-week course of ways to add oomph to various parts of the day. Sign up for it here.

And by the way, did you know that when the aforementioned dynasty took power in 1925, its country was still known to the world as Persia? It wasn’t until 1935 that the shah asked the international community to start calling the place Iran, to better reflect its makeup (not all Iranians are ethnically Persian).

This was generally accommodated. Then Winston Churchill got involved; the British premier worried that the new name was too close to Iraq’s and would cause confusion during World War II, when both countries were occupied by the Allies. He requested a temporary swap back, and the Iranians—or Persians?—amazingly agreed.

And by the way, did you know that venison, which comes from the Latin for “to hunt,” once referred to any wild game? That meant deer, but also hare, boar, some goats, and elk and their ilk.

That catchall spirit lives on today in South Africa. Because the country’s continent has no native deer species, venison there means meat from eland, kudu, gemsbok, springbok, or impala—which, to save you a search, are all species of antelope.</div>

            <h2>The Islamic Republic Will Not Last</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/iran-protests-opposition-regime/685600/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Under the cover of a total internet shutdown that has now lasted more than 100 hours, Iran’s security forces have unleashed bone-chilling brutality on protesters, killing at least 2,000 people, according to Iranian officials. Rather than hiding its crimes, the regime has broadcast footage from a morgue on state television. Corpses overflowed the facility, where relatives searched for their loved ones. The news anchor casually declared that the bodies were mostly those of “ordinary people.”

This is not another incidence of the Iranian regime crushing a mass protest. Rather, it might just be the end of the Islamic Republic. But the Iranian opposition could still blow it.

Although Iranians have demonstrated in huge numbers again and again—in 2009–10, 2017–18, 2019–20, and 2022–23—the protest movement has repeatedly failed to produce a well-organized leadership that poses a clear alternative to the regime. If this time is going to be different, the opposition has to fix that problem.

Read: Is the Iranian regime about to collapse?

In this wave of protests, for the first time, thousands of Iranians chanted slogans in support of an opposition leader abroad seeking to dismantle the regime. Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of the former shah, has declared himself ready to lead the transition away from the Islamic Republic. His call for protesters to come out last Thursday and Friday (Iran’s weekend) helped grow the numbers to levels probably unseen since 2009.

Pahlavi doesn’t appear to have a coherent follow-up plan, however. His subsequent calls for workers’ strikes in strategic sectors weren’t answered on any scale. He claims to have the loyalty of thousands of defectors in the security forces, but the evidence for this has not emerged. And although he enjoys significant support on the Iranian street, he still seems to lack the type of organized on-the-ground networks necessary for the long haul.

Politically, Pahlavi has been anything but a unifying figure for the Iranian opposition. Instead of bringing together the opponents of the regime around a shared program, his camp (including his major advisers) antagonizes non-monarchist opponents of the regime. Perhaps in order to draw sole emphasis to pro-Pahlavi slogans such as “Javid shah” (“Long live the king”), his supporters now decry the rallying call of the 2022–23 protests, “Women, life, freedom,” as a distraction. Pahlavi dropped these words from his social-media bios last week. And the former crown prince has persistently implored Donald Trump to intervene militarily in Iran, suggesting that his strategy depends on the aid of a president who just last week refused calls to meet him. (Trump has, however, actively supported the protests, and today admonished Iranians to “KEEP PROTESTING—TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS.”)

Pahlavi has become the opposition front-runner despite these shortcomings mainly because he doesn’t face many rivals. Liberal opposition leaders, such as the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi and the former Cabinet minister Mostafa Tajzadeh, languish in prison. Alongside 15 other figures, they issued a call on January 2 for a “peaceful transition” away from the regime. But they enjoy nothing like Pahlavi’s name recognition and are unable to organize their supporters from behind bars. The non-monarchist opposition forces abroad (called “republicans” in Iranian political parlance) have failed to come together, and they spend much of their time complaining about Pahlavi instead of organizing their own ranks. The result is a divided opposition that wages war with itself rather than trying to build a united front against the regime.

Iranians need a unifying and diverse coalition to lead them. The protest movement also needs to secure defections from the regime’s security forces. Without this, it is unlikely to be able to replace the Islamic Republic with a democracy. With it, success is thinkable. Opponents of the Iranian regime have important differences, but most share these common goals: free elections for a constituent assembly, and the safeguarding of Iran’s territorial integrity.

And the Islamic Republic really is in distress. It has been exposed as lacking not just democratic legitimacy but also basic competence. The state has been reduced to clusters of financial and military elites who enrich themselves without even the pretense of acting in the public interest. Of the previous four major rounds of protests, three were sparked by the regime’s inability to provide its people with economic security. Internationally, Iran is now one of the most isolated states in the world. Two decades ago, it could rely on improving ties with Europe, Canada, and Australia, and it held significant sway in the region. Now even its lukewarm relationships with Western countries have gone cold, and it has lost anti-Western allies such as Syria and Venezuela. Pro-Iranian militias in the Arab world have been decimated.

Cold-blooded as it has proved to be, the regime won’t be able to kill its way out of this crisis. The core policies of the 1979 revolution—puritanical sociocultural repression at home and anti-Western and anti-Israeli activity abroad—will have to be discarded. This will be true even if the regime strikes a Venezuela-style deal with Trump in which it offers the scalp of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in exchange for the survival of its security institutions. In such a scenario, the regime’s defining structure—clerical rule shepherded by a grand ayatollah—would have to be abandoned.

Under the combined pressure of Iranian citizens on the streets and adversarial governments abroad, the Islamic Republic is set to finally unravel. Few will miss it—not its Arab and Israeli neighbors; not the far-flung countries in Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere where it has committed its crimes; certainly not Iranians who have suffered under it for almost half a century. What remains is to replace the Islamic Republic with something that reflects the aspirations of Iran’s people.</div>

Now comes word that a device, purchased by the Pentagon, has been tested which may be linked to what is known as Havana Syndrome.&quot;IMO this does not justify calling it a &quot;Pentagon device&quot; in the headline, causing clickbait-grade implications.

Now comes word that a device, purchased by the Pentagon, has been tested which may be linked to what is known as Havana Syndrome.&quot;

IMO this does not justify calling it a &quot;Pentagon device&quot; in the headline, causing clickbait-grade implications.

This is a very misleading headline based on what the article says. The summary makes it sound like the Pentagon had this device in Havana and their own device caused this syndrome. That&#39;s not the case at all.

The Pentagon purchased the device as part of their investigation, and they tested the device and determined it could be the cause of the injuries and symptoms. It contains Russian components, but that doesn&#39;t mean that Russia deployed it or even made the complete device (although that is likely).

What remains a mystery is how it could be deployed without being detected and located, and why it was wasted on relatively unimportant employees.

and they tested the device and determined it could be the cause of the injuries and symptoms.Nothing in the article says that.

and they tested the device and determined it could be the cause of the injuries and symptoms.

I clicked at least 5 of those links...none were to the actual current article.

Shame on the submitter and editor here mixing the end of biden administration, 2015, and other random stuff.

Dude just give me the article in question where USA bought a device from SOMEWHERE that looks like it might be the thing that did the thing.

Tens of millions of dollars to cause some discomfort in your enemy and occasionally get one of them to quit?

Doesn&#39;t seem like an effective use of spending for Russia or Cuba.

It sounds like you&#39;ve been asleep for a few years. They are getting quite realistic and will continue to become even more so. If you were the victim of one of these, you wouldn&#39;t be claiming they are harmless.

There is harm when deepfakes are created for revenge porn.The viewers aren&#39;t aware the pictures aren&#39;t real. Even if they are, it works for shaming just as well as true images.

I disagree..it&#39;s a form of sexual harassment.

Allowing people to &quot;sue&quot; is not enough. Criminal charges are warranted for this behavior.

If the porn star resembles your daughter, that&#39;s unfortunate, but if that porn star then uses tech and,or makeup to disguise as your daughter, specifically, then makes and distributes porn claiming to be your daughter, that&#39;s different. It&#39;s a new take on slander or libel.

The laws have to change to address deep fakes. Trying to shoehorn this new space into existing frameworks is clumsy. It&#39;s good that it is happening.

People should have some control over images published of themselves.

The point of using a deepfake is to imitate the target person in a way that can convince others that it&#39;s real, or at least plausible. That is way beyond &quot;parody.&quot;

You do not need a convincing doppleganger of an individual to parody them. If anything, such an exact recreation is antithetical to what parody is and how it works.=Smidge=

I have not seen Sassy Justice, but the law does look to apply specifically to &quot;intimate images&quot;, which I assume Sassy Justice would not fall under. Also, I assume parody could be used as defense in the case as well.

Should painting [mymodernmet.com] also be criminalized?

There are real people that can hand paint a nude painting of people. Many of them accept commissions.

If not, will you have to prove it was hand drawn?

Art is subjective, but we all know what we like.

It&#39;s been tough to translate AI productivity improvements into improved revenue. I predict that for the most part we&#39;ll see companies cut too much staff, lose a lot of institutional experience, and scramble to rehire when their competition does likewise.

The business world moves as a flock, it&#39;s a bit like sheep without a shepherd. And when half of us drown the ones that break away from the flock are the ones that survive.

&quot;We don&#39;t need as many employees thanks to AI&quot; is often an excuse to lay off due to slack sales without spooking investors. They hope investors see it as a sign the company is modernizing instead of having slack sales, the likely real reason.

So take such claims with a big grain of salt.

Probably. But I think quite a few of the ones starting out with the pretext then start to believe it themselves and do damage.

The problem I have with the logic that using AI means you don&#39;t need as many employees. It&#39;s indirectly claiming their industry is limited to some finite amount of production. Not how it works, every good employee you have working for you is producing more than it costs you to pay them. If you can suddenly afford to make your current staffing more productive without raising payroll, then by God why not do that? (I know why, it&#39;s because the rich are extracting capital from their businesses. they don&#39;t care

More like impossible unless you make LLM hardware or build datacenters. OpenAI bleeds money like crazy and so are its competitors. There is, as of yet, no working business model that would even allow a break-even on the extreme cost. And we are 3 years in. It seems unlikely that business model can be found.

I do agree that the damage done is spectacular. And you usually cannot get that lost institutional experience back. That pretty much means quite a few enterprises going into collapse or irrelevancy.

I was told these costly tariffs would bring manufacturing back to this country. All the out of work people can just line up at the well paying factories and submit paper applications. Women and negroes need not apply.

They will probably just shoot people. The are already running tests in that after all.

The financial community and financial analysts need to start asking how come corporate top line revenue, excluding the largest 10 companies, has been declining or flat adjusted for inflation for the last 10 years.

AI is the cover story for many companies which are restructuring due to demographic shifts, a decade of cost cutting as a business plan, focusing on things which increase executive compensation instead of new product development and letting C level executives age in place via stagnation and keeping

Does it handle Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)?

(I use LightBurn for some laser cutters. It only runs on Windows and there&#39;s no viable substitute. Wine fails because it didn&#39;t handle WMI)

I wonder what functionality WMI provides to Lightburn that can&#39;t be programmed around? Lightburn runs perfectly fine on macOS, which obviously lacks WMI. Unless there&#39;s some major feature I&#39;m missing on macOS.

Main developer says &quot;WMI is required by our licensing system&quot; https://forum.lightburnsoftwar... [lightburnsoftware.com]

I am not familiar with LightBurn, but your best bet would likely be to tweak Wine for specific compatibility with LightBurn, or get the developer of LightBurn to  tweak LightBurn&#39;s source code for specific compatibility with Wine..  WMI Support should be completely unnecessary to talk to external hardware.    A  Windows application only needs WMI support to query management information of your local operating system or computer...    It is actually very suspicious that a desktop application is touching WMI,

According to the developer, WMI is required for their licensing system [lightburnsoftware.com].

It sucks, really. Before I bought hardware I surveyed the available software packages, LightBurn was best in class and they supported linux.

About a year later, they dropped linux support.

Kind of dumb isn&#39;t it.  I mean you already have an expensive dongle called a laser cutter.  I dealt with that kind of garbage for years with high-end scientific instrumentation. I mean you spend a million dollars on an instrument and then they have the gall to make you use a hardware security dongle to use the instrument.

They really want to make sure they get a cheque from you every few years when they roll out software patches.  And they wonder why they have software piracy issues with this sort of treatme

About a year later, they dropped linux support.

That sucks.  Have you given J Tech&#39;s Inkscape plugin [jtechphotonics.com] a shot (tutorial [inkscape.org])?  What hardware are you using, and can it work with Grbl?  Do you see any promising packages in Grbl&#39;s list of successors [github.com]?

You can run LightBurn natively. They made old versions that ran on Linux, the latest was released in March 2025. Version 1.7.08.You may need to work with their license portal though to get it working.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s campaign to punish Sen. Mark Kelly—a retired Navy captain—for urging members of the armed forces to disobey unlawful orders, is even more outlandish, and legally baseless, than it seems at first glance.

This past November, in a 90-second video addressed to service members, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had served in the military or in intelligence agencies stated that the Constitution was under threat from abroad and here at home, and that “our laws are clear—you can refuse illegal orders. … You must refuse illegal orders.”

The video failed to mention President Donald Trump’s name or any of his policies, but in the wake of military actions and threats he was making at the time, especially toward Venezuela, the message was clear.

In response, Trump denounced the video as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS … punishable by DEATH!” He added, a bit later, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!”

Hegseth characteristically chimed in with his own denunciations and, last week, issued a formal letter of censure, which could lead to a demotion of Kelly’s rank, reducing his benefits. Kelly could even be recalled to active duty, then court-martialed, an act that would remove his military status entirely and even land the senator in prison.

On Monday, Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy, claiming that they were trying to deny his constitutional rights and requesting a federal judge to block them from carrying out their threats.

Kelly’s case seems to be a slam dunk. Even if the judge allows Hegseth and Phelan to pursue their censure, it is extremely unlikely—though I hesitate to say impossible, because nothing is impossible with this administration—that the senator’s persecutors will succeed.

First, and most obviously, the notion that Kelly and his colleagues committed sedition, treason, or any sort of crime with their video is preposterous. They were not encouraging service members to defy specific orders—only reminding them that they are obligated not to follow unlawful orders. In this, the lawmakers were merely reciting the clear language of military law.

Second, even if this were seditious (or even if Kelly had made some truly treasonous remark), retired officers cannot be demoted for things they say or do after they retire. “The statutes on this are absolutely clear,” Eugene Fidell, a senior scholar specializing in military law at Yale Law School, told me on Tuesday. (Retired officers can be demoted for things they had said or done on active duty, but no one is even pretending that Kelly’s record as a Navy pilot was anything but salutary.)

Third, retired officers can be court-martialed for sedition. If found guilty, they could be stripped of all military rank or even imprisoned. However, a court-martial would require a trial in a military court, with the prosecutors presenting evidence of criminality. Even Hegseth must realize that the more hard-line military court would likely dismiss a case based on a video in which Kelly recites a fundamental plank of military law.

Could Hegseth just go ahead and sign an order demoting Kelly and docking his retirement pay? Actually, no. According to Fidell, the secretary of defense has the authority to demote only flag officers—that is, generals and admirals. Kelly’s rank of captain, the highest of the U.S. Navy’s senior officers, is one notch below rear admiral, the lowest-ranking flag officer.

However, Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, could sign such an order. If he did, Fidell told me, Kelly could sue him in federal claims court—and very likely succeed at getting his pay restored and making the Pentagon’s civilian leaders look appallingly petty. The consequences could be deeply demoralizing, within the Pentagon and at U.S. military bases (not that this possibility has deterred Hegseth from his antics so far).

Kelly sees what’s really going on here. In a statement released while filing his lawsuit, Kelly said that Hegseth’s “unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: If you speak out and say something that the president or secretary of defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.” He added, “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

Actually, this does seem to be the way things work in the United States of America now. I know of a few officers who are hesitant to speak out against Trump or his policies precisely because they fear retribution—and lack the access to resources, high profile, and legal protections that Kelly enjoys as a member of Congress. There is also a disposition among many officers, bred in them from their days as cadets, to steer clear of political activity, even if it’s meant to protest the politicization of the military.

Still, there are rumblings of change. Kelly’s suit is one. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s video pushback against the Trump Justice Department’s criminal investigation is another. The votes of a few (remarkably few, but still a few) Republican lawmakers—voicing new dissent against Trump’s war-making powers in Venezuela, his imperial threats against Greenland, and even his desire to kill Obamacare—may be more wavelets in a turning tide.

Meanwhile, the crusade against Captain Kelly seems doomed to a proper flameout.

It was the most unlikely response to the widely expected overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the summer of 2021, a small group of about 12 individuals, including some health care workers, elected officials, and local community activists, in the deep-red state of Wyoming—which didn’t have a single abortion clinic at the time—began planning to open a new clinic in the college town of Casper. This was at the same time that most abortion clinics in red states, seeing the writing on the wall, had begun planning to close or move to a more hospitable location. But not in Wyoming.

And this long-shot gamble paid off. Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortions as well as other services including family planning, general gynecology, and gender affirming care, opened its doors in spring 2023, almost a year after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Since then, the clinic has faced unending legal challenges from the state. However, at each turn, the clinic has prevailed, culminating in a big win before the Wyoming Supreme Court last week. This ruling, which may have significance for abortion rights beyond Wyoming, struck down the state’s general abortion ban as well as a specific ban on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.

How did this implausible turn of events come to pass? Beyond the determination of the community group in Casper, two main factors explain the ultimate success of this venture: Wyoming’s unique libertarian constitution and the savvy and determination of a woman named Julie Burkhart. In a wonderful instance of karma, the famously libertarian citizens of Wyoming, enraged by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” in 2010, amended their constitution, stipulating that individuals have the right to make their own health care decisions. This amendment became the heart of the legal strategy used by the would-be clinic’s lawyers, and this argument ultimately prevailed.

But there needed to be someone to use that constitutional provision, and that’s where Julie Burkhart came in. Julie is a longtime, well-known figure in abortion-providing circles. She is not a clinician, but rather an abortion access strategist and a skillful clinic operator who has a track record of opening abortion facilities in hostile and underserved areas. It was this reputation that led the Casper group to invite her to work with them even when Roe was about to be overturned.

Julie’s involvement with abortion care began in 2001, when she began work with Dr. George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was assassinated in 2009 in his church by an anti-abortion fanatic. Tiller’s mentorship was deeply influential for Julie, and she has worked in the abortion field since his death. She purchased his Wichita clinic from his widow and reestablished abortion there, a city that had been left without such care after Tiller’s death. She also went on to open a clinic in Oklahoma, as well as several other places.

As part of a book project on how people in various sectors of the abortion-providing community were preparing for and then responding to the Dobbs, we interviewed Julie three times over the course of 2022. These interviews took place at the very beginning of that year, immediately after the decision was announced in June, and finally at the end of 2022.

Our first interview with Julie, in January 2022, took place while she and her Casper allies were already actively planning how to move forward with an abortion clinic. A lucky break occurred, she told us, when a wealthy donor purchased a facility from a medical practice that had closed and donated it to the group. This purchase was especially fortuitous as the facility was in an area already zoned to permit a medical clinic.

Finding a contractor to upgrade the clinic for abortion services was a challenge, though. Abortion providers have long faced difficulties finding people willing to work with them. Even if the individual workers involved are not opposed to abortion, they often have realistic fears of being targeted by anti-abortion forces and being subjected to boycotts. Julie did manage to convince a local contractor to do the necessary work, vaguely telling him the clinic was for a “women’s health center.” The contractor did eventually learn the intended purpose of the facility, but continued to do the work, and tellingly, did not post a sign on the site giving the name of his company, as is normally done.

Julie’s fervent hope was to open the clinic about a month before Dobbs was expected to be announced, on the theory that since the clinic would offer a range of services, it could not be shut down, even if providing abortions was no longer legal in the state. As she put it, “So if something does happen in Wyoming, we will have that presence. We will have community ties. We will have standing if we have to go to court.”

But this hope of a pre-Dobbs opening was dashed in May 2022 when Julie awoke to a phone call informing her that the nearly finished clinic had been firebombed. Upon going to the clinic, she learned that most of the building would need to be gutted and rebuilt. The arsonist was eventually caught, but this set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

The summer of 2022 got even worse weeks later with the announcement of the Dobbs decision. When we spoke to her shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Julie was predictably devastated. “I was so angry, so hurt,” she said. Julie spent the day after the decision listening to music at very high volume—including old feminist anthems from the 1970s. But neither the firebombing, the Dobbs decision, nor the Wyoming Legislature’s vote to ban abortion, if the Supreme Court allowed it to do so, broke her and caused her to retreat. As she said to us with more passion in her voice than in previous conversations, “I want to tell you, in Wyoming, we are going to litigate; we are going to fight this thing to the end.”

Finding legal representation proved yet another challenge. Several national legal groups who represented abortion clinics, while very supportive of the idea of a new clinic in Wyoming, were reluctant to get involved, feeling that the aspiration was unrealistic and that their limited resources in the face of a hostile U.S. Supreme Court were better spent elsewhere. But Julie and her comrades finally located local lawyers willing to represent them. Together, they promptly seized the above-mentioned constitutional amendment as their core legal argument.

This strategy quickly paid off. Several lower court victories allowed the clinic to open in 2023, when it began serving not only people in Wyoming but also those from surrounding states which have banned abortion. Julie has since told us there has been both community support and opposition to the clinic. Tellingly in this era of anti-trans sentiment, in some instances, the hostility is as much about the clinic’s provision of gender-affirming care as about abortion.

With the resounding victory from the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, Julie was celebratory when we emailed with her. However, nothing is “over” when it comes to abortion conflicts, especially in a place like Wyoming. In response to the decision, the state’s governor has called for a ballot measure in the 2026 election to amend the state constitution to ban abortion. These kinds of measures since Dobbs have mostly supported the pro-choice position, even in red states. It is unclear how the vote would go in Wyoming, if indeed it is on the ballot. If the measure is before the voters, it is clear that Julie and the Casper community will be actively helping to defeat it.

It’s perhaps inevitable that there are already several online fundraisers for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week. Conservative social media users often rally to financially defend anyone perceived as a member of their team, regardless of how unpalatable their actions might be. One GoFundMe for the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has already raised more than $439,000, $10,000 of which came from the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who argued that everyone deserves a hearty defense.

But there was one specific fundraiser that betrayed just how careless the right has become in its tribalist impulses. On GiveSendGo, the “Christian” alternative to GoFundMe, the primary fundraising post for Ross is explicitly white supremacist in nature.

GiveSendGo was built as a kind of conservative, faith-based alternative to GoFundMe, and it has crowdfunded small fortunes for plenty of conservative heroes accused of violent or bigoted actions. For example, it hosted a campaign that raised $836,000 for Shiloh Hendrix, the white mother who called a child on a playground the N-word. It is also where Kyle Rittenhouse raised more than $586,000 for his defense after he killed two men in 2020. Many Jan. 6 insurrectionists—even those who assaulted police officers in their efforts to overturn the election—turned to this platform when they wanted help.

But the site’s Ross fundraiser, which has raised more than $171,000, reveals an even darker side of these crowdfunding efforts.

Titled “Stand With Our Brave ICE Hero,” the fundraiser is a legitimate campaign connected to the agent. It has been shared by Jacob Wells, a co-founder of GiveSendGo, who has personally vouched, on social media, that the funds will go to Ross. It was boosted by major conservative accounts, as well as the right-wing news outlet Alpha News, which was the first publication to share video from Ross’ perspective of the Minneapolis encounter.

But skim to the third paragraph of its description of the event, and you’ll see—or would have seen, as the page has since been edited—a rather odd description of the situation: “This didn’t happen in a vacuum—it’s the direct result of anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish) fanning the flames of resistance.”

In case that reference to Frey’s religion isn’t enough, there are other tells about this particular fundraiser’s specific white supremacist leanings. The fundraiser’s URL is www.givesendgo.com/Theyallmustgo. Then there’s the opener, addressing “America First patriots”—a signal, often, to the more white supremacist element of the right. The text also speaks of “illegal aliens … flooding our nation … and threatening our sovereignty” and of efforts to “purge … parasites from our soil,” dehumanizing rhetoric that evokes Great Replacement conspiracy theories.

But we don’t actually need to decipher the language here, because the man who created the account is an avowed white supremacist who has no desire to hide his views. On X, the man—who goes by Tom Hennessey, it’s unclear if that is his real name—defended the killing by asking if Good was a “negrophile” and arguing that “American stormtroopers … should be able to use extraordinary violence on our behalf.” He celebrates whiteness on his account, argues for the protection of “White American bloodlines,” and promotes the idea that Jews ruin white nations by “flooding” them with immigrants.

It’s not clear if he has any direct connection to Ross, but this isn’t his first fundraiser. In November, Hennessey set up a GoFundMe page for a 20-year-old Mississippi State University student who yelled “Fuck the Jews” at Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. (The page said that Jewish complaints about “hate speech” were weaponized to get “the goyim get locked up.”) And in December, Hennessey set up another page, this time for Crystal Wilsey, a woman who repeatedly used the N-word at a Somali American couple and declared herself to be “a racist.” In fact, the ICE agent page was admittedly out of character for Hennessey, as it didn’t involve an explicitly racist incident. But it did establish this as, at minimum, a hobby for him.

The people who donated to this GoFundMe, or those who just expressed interest, such as Megyn Kelly, may not have all read the page or clocked its white supremacist origins. It has since been edited to remove the reference to Frey’s Judaism; it has not been toned down that much overall. But this incident shows the carelessness behind right-wing solidarity. Ross’ supporters, acting on a kind of anti-left impulse, may think they’re helping their movement by supporting patriots. They are also exposing overt hatred at the core of the anti-immigrant movement.

By now, the footage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shooting and killing Minneapolis mom of three Renee Nicole Good has been pored over and dissected frame by frame. When Good tried to drive away from her otherwise anemic standoff with ICE, Ross shot her in the face. Good was barred from receiving medical aid for 15 minutes. It’s all pretty grisly, and it’s increasingly mundane. Already this year, the agency has killed two people. Last year, its most fatal year since 2004, it killed 32. That’s one reason it feels as if Ross could get away with this, a murder, entirely without consequence. ICE has always seemed to operate with impunity, even before this particular administration, and the federal probe into Good’s killing is starting to impede the state investigation.

But on Friday night, a new angle emerged—cellphone footage from Ross himself. In it, more realities of the killing are clarified: Good wasn’t antagonizing the agent, and she had turned her wheels not to try to hit him but instead to drive away slowly. Most telling are Ross’ final words, after he shoots Good but before he stops recording. As her van drifts off, Good soon to be dead in the driver’s seat, he mutters, “Fucking bitch,” mostly to himself.

I know, I know: Who gives a shit about mere words when he literally murdered a woman in the street? On camera, in front of witnesses? With the president defending his every move? It’s almost farcical to care. But to call Good a “fucking bitch”—after he already shot her—still tells us plenty about what Donald Trump and his soldiers think about the rest of us. It also shows us plenty about where we’ve come as a society in this decade of MAGA. Trump often speaks about women as disposable. One of the first times the president showed us he plays by a different set of rules was when he bounced back after being caught on a hot mic talking to Billy Bush about how he could “grab [women] by the pussy.”

The snarl of Ross calling Good a “fucking bitch” is familiar in the way any garden-variety misogynistic comment is to most women. He said it after he shot her, after it was clear she would be grievously injured at best and dead at worst. It was adding literal insult to injury, an aside meant mostly for himself, to shore him up as the big man who won the fight with this small girl. It wasn’t enough to just kill her—he had to insult her in a uniquely female way too. Ross could have called her a fucking asshole. A piece of shit. A member of Hamas! There was plenty of incendiary invective for Ross to pull from. He chose to call Good a bitch because it’s what men call us all the time. It was easy, and lazy.

Agents like Ross resent women like Good because they don’t give a shit about his authority. (Her evident queerness wasn’t likely to help either.) She was behaving the way we want our mothers to behave—protective, strong—and the way we need white women to act, getting in between the most vulnerable people in their communities and the forces trying to hurt them. She was punished for it in a few ways.

Good’s final sentences to the ICE agent were telling too: “I’m not mad at you.” On paper, this seems like the exact right way to de-escalate a hostile conversation with a police officer; in reality, it’s that kind of dismissal that likely pissed Ross off so much in the first place. The fear is part of the point for ICE; why else would its members hunt mothers down in front of day cares, taking children out of their arms?

Good refused to give ICE any of her fear, up until the very end. Her plan was to drive away calmly, moving like someone who wasn’t afraid of the big bad wolf trying to scare her on her block. Maybe she would have had a better chance if she had showed him she was afraid; he could have retained some agency over her. But for her to drive away, a smile on her face? That’s something only a fucking bitch would do.

One thing this Trump administration has given us, especially post-COVID, is the unvarnished truth of how mean everything is. The Obama administration deported people en masse too. There have always been murders at the hands of the police. But Trump’s version of law and order is so brazenly cruel, so demonstratively evil, that it at least makes it easier to point at, clearer to define. What Good’s murder clarifies for us, among other brutalities, is that the administration and the army it has deployed have categorized the people who live in this country in tidy boxes. Those boxes are labeled with slurs.

God, how low we’ve sunk. At least when Trump was boasting about grabbing women by the pussy, he was doing it behind closed doors. Back then, he knew he had to eke out a mealymouthed apology for the sake of decorum. Now any pretense of such decorum is gone—the uberrich, like Bill Ackman, are helping fund the next act of a guy who killed a woman in her family van. Is it still locker-room talk if they say it to our faces, gun cocked? Never mind that the political and media figures who publicly mourned Charlie Kirk and denounced his public execution have been largely silent about Good’s death. That hypocrisy is obvious, even if it’s still devastating.

This week, there will continue to be countless attempts to justify what Ross said. Words are not actions. He was afraid she was going to hit him with her van. She should have gotten out of the car. Nothing matters except this: Ross called Good a fucking bitch because it’s what he thinks of her. It’s what guys like Ross think about all of us. It’s just that now guys like Ross, and guys like a president, feel free to say it out loud. What a relief, in a way, to hear it stated so plainly.

In the fall of 2015, a horde of lawyers from across the country descended on Las Vegas and beelined for the Bellagio Resort and Casino. They weren’t in town to hear Britney Spears, immerse themselves in the Strip’s glitz and glamour, or answer the siren call of the blackjack tables. But they did harbor gamblers’ get-rich goals.

The draw: a conference called “Mass Torts Made Perfect,” held in the hotel’s grand ballroom, tucked well behind its famous musical water fountain. It was the nation’s largest gathering of attorneys who represent groups of people injured—or killed—by exposure to products like opioids or asbestos.

Some of the attorneys, the insiders, were already rich beyond imagining. Others, like the Elvis impersonators roaming the streets, were wannabes, eager to tap into the mass tort gold mine.

A mass tort is personal-injury litigation on steroids. It’s not just one fender-bender victim with whiplash out for a few thousand bucks. Nor is it a class action over $3 ATM fees that alerts consumers via junk mail. It’s hundreds, thousands, and sometimes more than 100,000 people suing over life-changing physical harm from asbestos-laced baby powder, from NFL concussions, from pacemakers, hip implants, and other medical products.

Ordinarily, plaintiffs expect to file a lawsuit and have a suit-and-tie lawyer usher them through to trial, where they can tell the jury how corporate wrongdoing wrecked their health. But in mass torts, a panel of seven judges decides which federal judge will handle all federal lawsuits with similar facts. Then injured plaintiffs from Alaska to Maine find their cases shipped off to a single judge somewhere in the United States through a process known as multidistrict litigation. With thousands of cases mushed into a scrum, trials disappear and individuals become numbers on a spreadsheet.

At the center of these mass tort cases are real people seeking justice from large corporations. None of those people was in Las Vegas. This gathering was for their lawyers, who paid $1,495 each to attend. This event was about money and power.

Outside the Bellagio’s grand ballroom, three men registered for the conference. They’d jetted in on separate planes, lest one go down. Nine seasoned “spokesmodels” in electric-blue dresses sashayed around them in the hallway like roving disco balls.

“Come party with us tonight,” the women said, handing out embossed invitations to passing lawyers.

“They can’t do that,” snapped the woman behind the makeshift registration desk. “That’s like free advertising.”

With a snort, the youngest of the three men peeled off $10,000 in cash, slapped it on the desk, and registered the strippers too.

The evening’s party hosts were Vincent Chhabra, his son and front man Michael, and Ron Lasorsa, principals in a company called Alpha Law LLC.

Though Alpha Law was billed as a law firm, Vince, Michael, and Ron weren’t lawyers, and their company was not a law firm in the usual sense. They were entrepreneurs who ran a call center that generated client leads. Their Florida-based business raised the hopes of women who’d been hurt, added their names to a giant database of “clients,” then collaborated with real lawyers willing to pay for the clients’ names—and to fork over 85 percent of their attorneys fees to Alpha Law, their new “co-counsel,” if they settled the cases.

Vincent was a first-generation Indian immigrant and dot-com whiz kid. His early online pill mill had led to prison time, which got extended for running an online puppy scam. Out for a few years, he ventured into call centers that targeted women injured by pelvic mesh, a device intended to stabilize sagging organs and cure incontinence but which left many women in diapers and debilitating pain.

Ron, a New Yorker from Long Island, was Vince’s stocky, tattooed business partner. He’d been a company commander at the Marine Corps School of Infantry, gone bald after two tours of duty in Kuwait, and done a long stint on Wall Street before getting fired, filing for divorce, and discovering mass torts.

Rounding out the trio was Michael, the 20-year-old son Vince had been grooming to take over the business since he was 6. At 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, Michael was still growing into his lanky frame and taking classes at Ohio State. He looked nothing like his dad; he had light skin and blue eyes and was 6 inches taller.

That night, in one of the Bellagio’s opulent suites, the three celebrated with a lavish house party. Just months before, they had sold the names of 14,000 clients to a Texas law firm for $40 million. Those clients were mostly women injured by pelvic mesh. And despite the sale, the trio had no intention of exiting the business.

Music pulsed as lawyers crammed into the suite to ogle the performing strippers. Some elbowed their way closer, others puffed on cigars or weed, and a chosen few leaned back to enjoy lap dances—plus less stand-up activities. Glasses filled with amber liquor, neat, clinked and sloshed onto the billiard table. Late into the night, the guys draped themselves with barely clad women in a photo booth, memorializing the moment. Remnants of white powder stuck to tabletops and bathroom counters. And mobile IV hydration stations stood ready to serve cocktails of vitamins, amino acids, and anti-nausea meds to take the edge off in the morning.

The music, the women, the open bar, the outfits—Armani meets Miami Vice—gave the soiree a Wolf of Wall Street vibe. The details of that night in 2015 vary depending on whom you ask. Someone photographed prominent attorney partygoers in the act and “basically blackmailed” them into payoffs or future business deals. Whether the women or the Chhabras sprang the honey trap was never clear.

The next day at the pool, which had a golden fountain spouting from the middle, was a scene straight out of Animal House: Polo club lawyers sipped bloody marys and mimosas on one side, and the Alpha Law crew wrestled like bawdy Delta House frat bros on the other.

Led by “Savage,” a tough blonde, nine women clad in acid-blue bikinis and stilettos paraded through the Bellagio’s corridors. Advertising Alpha Law, they coaxed male lawyers to the rowdy poolside cabana.

Mike Papantonio was among the invited conference-goers. Pap, as he liked to be called, presided as master of ceremonies. His law firm had invented “Mass Torts Made Perfect” and ran it as a conference for elite plaintiffs’ attorneys nationwide to rub elbows and strategize, making him the unofficial president of the polo club posse. Even as the upper crust regarded Alpha Law’s members as parasites, some of the elite in pelvic-mesh multidistrict-litigation leadership positions profited handily from their efforts.

Pap was surely not amused by Savage’s party; he’d already gotten an earful about the previous night’s shenanigans. He sent out a reproachful email saying everything and nothing at the same time: “A group of individuals … were involved during the seminar in business practices that we do not condone and will not tolerate.” Above the Law, a clever, classed-up National Enquirer for lawyers, filed it under “Conferences/sex” and mused, “Jesus, why don’t we go to these seminars?”

Ron, Vincent, and Michael, however, were on top of the world, the new fat cats on the rise. All the lights of Las Vegas, from Planet Hollywood to Caesars Palace, lay at their feet.

The Bellagio’s grand ballroom felt much like its casino—ornate, windowless, sour with old cigarette smoke. Mike Papantonio strutted on a raised stage, his own face a hundred times larger than life on the screen behind him. With the gestures, voice, and pomaded hair of a televangelist, he introduced a panel of mostly white men in suits, a few female lawyers defending medical device manufacturers, and two illustrious senior federal judges wrangling big cases.

Oblivious to the evening and poolside shenanigans, I sat about halfway back, embedded in a sea of plaintiffs’ lawyers who routinely earn more on a single mass tort deal than I’d take home in 15 years as a law professor. I’d long made noises about lawyers’ self-dealing—the stuff professors complain about over craft beer. I’d been invited to speak because I’m a national expert on mass torts, but no one really wanted me there. It was the inner circle, a cabal I’d tried to disband for more than a decade. Fighting nerves about my upcoming panel, I saw a text light up my phone. It was my boss, the law school dean. “How’s Vegas?” he asked. “SEAL Team Six on standby.”

I was about to repeat a presentation I had given the previous week at Duke Law School, where I highlighted the astronomical sums awarded to a handful of lawyers chosen to lead mass tort cases by a good-old-boy network. That practice, I argued, enriched everyone except their clients, the regular citizens who suffered the actual harm. My remarks moved an apoplectic plaintiff’s lawyer to point across the room at his opposing counsel, leer in my direction, and ask, “So are you accusing me of colluding with him?”

I never used the word collude. “Just curious about these numbers,” I said.

That lawyer was one of eight attorneys who’d led a massive multidistrict lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Propulsid, an acid-reflux drug popular in the 1990s whose side effects allegedly included deadly cardiac abnormalities. I’d unearthed plenty about the business side of this famous case that they’d all have preferred to keep buried.

Lawyers claimed that the Propulsid settlements were worth between $84 million and $105 million total. But most plaintiffs—99.4 percent—got nothing. Only 37 of 6,012 plaintiffs received anything, and collectively it was less than $6.5 million. Lead attorneys like the red-faced lawyer had made money not only by settling their own clients’ cases but by spearheading the lawsuit. For that work, defendant Johnson & Johnson paid them—the plaintiffs’ lawyers (!)—a whopping $27 million.

How could the injured get so little while their lawyers purchased private jets?

Now, surrounded by the Moulin Rouge feel of the Bellagio, I made my way up to the dais and laid out those damning numbers in the lawyers’ den, where I was the only thing standing between them and lunch with legendary running back Emmitt Smith.

But nothing would change. The status quo benefited the key stakeholders: The in crowd of plaintiffs’ attorneys got richer. Corporate defendants found settlements cheaper by the thousand. And judges received accolades when massive cases settled quickly—despite secret terms that typically made the money impossible to follow.

Plaintiffs were the ones who suffered. I knew because I’d spoken with them when their lawyers had not.

Afterward, those titans of tort seemed to have retained only one thing: that they were ranked on a list of lawyers chosen to command these cases. Never mind that it was a roster of the infamous, not the famous.

I wandered next door into the exhibit hall, where rows of tables were strapped with plastic banners and heaped with leaflets, mints, lens cleaners, highlighters, and tote bags. Herds of plaintiffs’ lawyers in suits, buttoned-down polo shirts, and the occasional high heels meandered past vendor booths hawking services for everything from medical records retrieval and client ads to law firm loans and settlement administration.

Those were the invisible hands greasing the wheels of mass torts, hands that propelled injured people through a maze they knew nothing about. I’d written about the industry for well over a decade, but I had no idea how vast it was until I saw its inner workings on display. Only much later would I realize that it wasn’t so much a smorgasbord of vendors as it was the Gorgon Medusa: When one head is removed, more sprout in its place.

Later, in the airport terminal, a slim, silver-haired conference attendee confirmed the snippets of hushed chatter I’d overheard in the Bellagio’s hallways. Something darker than lawyers’ self-dealing was stirring, and it involved pelvic mesh. An estimated 10 million women worldwide have pelvic mesh in their bodies, and hundreds of thousands of them were suing. The case would be bigger than the BP oil spill and Vioxx combined. Once the leviathan of profit for companies like Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific, pelvic mesh was now the white whale of liability for mass tort plaintiffs’ attorneys.

Pelvic mesh settlements were expected to total $11 billion, and everyone in the industry wanted a piece. Lead attorneys would receive $366 million of that in common-benefit fees for their work on behalf of all plaintiffs. With each plaintiff’s contingent fees ranging from 33 to 45 percent, non-lead lawyers would net between $3.63 billion and $4.95 billion, excluding costs. (As costs, one attorney charged a mesh client $575 for his steak dinner, $5,000 for his private plane, and $6,630 in interest.)

And the injured women? Their settlements would average $40,000 before fees and costs.

Though I’d escaped Las Vegas without needing a SEAL Team Six rescue, I soon found myself submerged in the legal system’s gritty underbelly, tracking a network of con men, bankrupt surgeons, chiropractors, medical funders, and lawyers who yearned to be insiders—all of them willing to do anything for a buck.

In that legal netherworld, women weren’t just plaintiffs. They were cash machines.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/isro_pslv_mission_fail/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India’s Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has commenced an investigation into the failure of a PSLV launcher.

The PSLV – aka the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle – is an expendable medium launch rocket that India devised and has flown since 1993. ISRO has launched 64 of the rockets and chalked up 58 successes. This mission, PSLV-C62 / EOS-N1, employed the PSLV-DL variant of the rocket, which uses a pair of external boosters. Other PSLV variants use four or six external boosters.

The mission was a commercial affair, with 15 payloads aboard.

Sadly, the craft’s third stage experienced an anomaly and the rocket didn’t reach its intended orbit. 14 of the payloads were lost, among them the Theos-2 Earth Observation satellite built jointly by the UK and Thailand, and AyulSat, an effort to demonstrate refueling in space.

The payload that survived is called the KID Capsule and is an experimental craft designed to return to Earth from space. KID is the work of a company called Orbital Paradigm, which figures the world has plenty of launch capacity but little ability to de-orbit payloads such as products manufactured in space. The company hopes to create commercial return-to-Earth capability.

In a pair of LinkedIn posts, the company reveals that KID fell to Earth along with the PSLV’s fourth stage.

“The capsule endured a way steeper angle than the nominal mission was foreseeing (around -20° instead of -5°),” the post states. “It seems we entered in the atmosphere still coupled to the rocket upper stage.”

The capsule nonetheless released, at the hellacious speed of Mach 20 and experienced 28g of force – almost twice the nominal scenario.

Despite those astounding forces, KID transmitted 190 seconds of telemetry, some of which indicate that its payloads remained at between 15°C and 30°C during the capsule’s very rapid descent. Sadly, the craft did not transmit data destined for customers.

“KID was tested beyond its design envelope, and it worked,” the post states. “Separation, power-on, and data transmission, even after reentry, all performed well despite degraded conditions. Based on initial analysis it seems that we achieved 4 out of 5 launch milestones, albeit through an off-nominal profile. The failure to deliver customers’ data prevents us from declaring the mission a success.”

Orbital Paradigm is therefore not entirely unhappy with the mission.

The same can’t be said for ISRO, whose director Doctor V. Narayanan appeared on the live stream of the launch to admit that the rocket’s third stage displayed “disturbance” followed by a deviation in its flight path.

ISRO’s last PSLV launch, May 2025’s PSLV-C61 / EOS-09, also failed after problems with its third stage.

India promotes itself as a proven source of cost-effective commercial launch capabilities, and a rising power in space.

No program exemplifies the latter more than Gaganyaan, India’s effort to launch humans into space and establish a space station and moon base. ISRO hopes to advance those ambitions during 2026 with three uncrewed missions. Gaganyaan will use another made-in-India rocket, the LVM3, which has a perfect record after 9 flights. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration will only allow exports of Nvidia and AMD GPUs to China if local buyers can get all the kit they want.

Recent US policy has restricted exports of advanced GPUs to China, on grounds that the Middle Kingdom can use them for military purposes. That ban meant Nvidia could not export its H200 accelerator to China. The company responded by creating the H20, a crippled version of the H200.

The Trump administration later banned exports of the H20, to prevent China improving its AI capabilities. Nvidia later said that decision cost it over $10 billion in sales.

The administration then reversed the ban and promised to allow H200 sales into China subject to certain conditions.

On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) revealed those conditions in a filing [PDF] that explains it will allow Nvidia and AMD to apply to export their H200 and MI325X models if they meet four criteria:

There’s also a requirement for any shipments to China to “be no more than 50% of the total product shipped to customers for end use in the United States of that product.”

AMD and Nvidia will also have to produce a list of remote users located within, or controlled by a parent company from, Belarus, China, Cuba, Iran, Macau, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela.

The BIS will conduct a case-by-case review of every application to export and says the new rules are necessary “to ensure the national security benefits of U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence.”

Nvidia and AMD launched the H200 and MI325X in 2024, and the devices do not use their most advanced architectures. If Chinese buyers pass the BIS’s test and can acquire the machines, they will therefore acquire less powerful chips than those available to US buyers – potentially preserving the USA’s lead if China doesn’t catch up with homegrown GPUs.

Or perhaps not, as Chinese hyperscalers and AI companies have often found ways to do more with less, as was the case with DeepSeek and Alibaba Cloud, which found a way to lift GPU utilization rates.

Shares in AMD and Nvidia stayed flat on Tuesday, suggesting investors don’t see the new rules as likely to deliver a flood of sales and revenue. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has added support for the JPEG XL (JXL) image format to the open source Chromium code base, reversing a decision in 2022 to drop the technology.

A recent commit to integrate and enable the JXL decoder means that future releases of Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers will include code to process and present JXL images.

The format&#39;s supporters argue JXL can be used to recompress existing JPEG images without loss so they&#39;re 20 percent smaller, which alone would represent a significant bandwidth saving for websites and content delivery networks.

It also offers other improvements over existing image file formats, like progressive decoding that prioritizes salient image elements – as noted in 2021 by Google engineers – and better lossy and lossless compression than formats like AVIF, MozJPEG, and WebP.

JPEG XL [PDF] began with a call for proposals in 2017. It started taking shape in 2019 through an effort to combine Cloudinary&#39;s Free Lossless Image Format (FLIF) with Google&#39;s PIK. It was standardized as ISO/IEC 18181 in 2021 and revised in 2024.

Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox initially implemented experimental support for JXL behind a settings flag in 2021, based on the possibility that JXL might be able to replace older JPEG and PNG formats.

A year later, Google Chrome engineers abandoned the open source image format by claiming &quot;There is not enough interest from the entire ecosystem to continue experimenting with JPEG XL.&quot;

They also argued the format “does not bring sufficient incremental benefits over existing formats to warrant enabling it by default.&quot; And they said that removing experimental support for the JXL code would reduce the maintenance burden.

In a 2023 blog post, Greg Farough, campaigns manager for the Free Software Foundation, implied that Google&#39;s disinterest in JXL reflected its preference for &quot;its own patented AVIF format.&quot; AVIF is governed by The Alliance for Open Media, an industry group whose members include Google.

Google&#39;s assertion about lack of interest in the technology was promptly challenged in the Chromium bug tracking discussion. Many of the 500+ comments in the thread disputed Google&#39;s claim and cited numerous companies that had expressed interest in broader support for JXL.

Roland Wooster, principal engineer for Intel&#39;s client computing group, said at the time that Intel and its partners saw JXL as the best option for high dynamic range (HDR) still images and urged the Chrome team to reconsider.

&quot;JPEG XL appears to be the only format with suitable compression for images on the web, 16-bit per color channel, and support for the color gamuts widely used by DSLR/MLC photographers, e.g. ProPhoto and other wide color gamuts capable of representing the color range captured by cameras,&quot; he wrote on August 24, 2022.

&quot;Beyond the critical requirements, JPEG XL also supports other highly important features: lossless compression options for archival usage, progressive image download for efficient web display, and based on others’ research appears to have class-leading compression rates, and superior image quality at the compression rates typically used for still images. No other format provides all of these important features for still images.&quot;

Representatives from other companies like Adobe, Cloudinary, Facebook, The Guardian, and Shopify echoed Intel&#39;s enthusiasm for JXL.

As for the purported maintenance burden, Jon Sneyers, senior image researcher at Cloudinary and editor of the JPEG XL spec, said in a November 2022 post that work required would be modest, amounting to little more than &quot;occasionally bumping up a version number in a build script&quot; to match a decoder library revision.

It took several more years for the message to sink in. In June 2023, Apple demonstrated its interest in the technology when it implemented support in WebKit for Safari 17. In September 2024, a member of Mozilla&#39;s Firefox team said the team would consider adopting JXL once a Rust-based decoder is available, citing safety concerns about the 100K lines of multithreaded C++ code within the reference libjxl decoder. That Rust-based alternative decoder, jxl-rs, is making progress.

Microsoft added support for JXL in Windows 11 version 24H2 in March 2025. And in November 2025, the PDF Association added JXL support to the spec.

That same month, on the mailing list for its Blink rendering engine, Google finally signaled its intention to integrate a memory-safe JPEG XL decoder in Chromium. That&#39;s jxl-rs. Now, two months later, integration has arrived. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft and Uncle Sam have warned that a Windows bug disclosed today is already under attack.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-20805 and discovered by Microsoft&#39;s own threat intel team, allows an authorized attacker to leak a memory address from a remote ALPC port.

&quot;Presumably, threat actors would then use the address in the next stage of their exploit chain – probably gaining arbitrary code execution,&quot; according to Trend Micro&#39;s Zero Day Initiative Head of Threat Awareness Dustin Childs&#39; analysis.

It&#39;s a medium-severity flaw, earning a 5.5 CVSS rating.

Shortly after Redmond pushed a patch, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added CVE-2026-20805 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, a step that means federal agencies must implement the fix by February 3. &quot;This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise,&quot; the feds warned.

While we don&#39;t know who is abusing this hole, nor how widespread the exploitation is. Microsoft declined to answer our questions on the matter, so we&#39;d suggest putting this patch at the top of the list.

&quot;Vulnerabilities of this nature are commonly used to undermine Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits,&quot; Kev Breen, senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive, told The Register.

&quot;By revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack,&quot; he added, while also dinging Redmond for not disclosing which other components may be involved in such an exploit chain.

That omission, Breen said, &quot;significantly&quot; limits network defenders&#39; &quot;ability to proactively threat-hunt for related activity. As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.&quot;

CVE-2026-20805 looks to be Microsoft&#39;s first zero-day bug of 2026, appearing on the first Patch Tuesday of the new year – and the patch dump is a whopper, with 112 Microsoft CVEs disclosed.

Of these, Microsoft lists two others as publicly known at the time of the release.

One of these, CVE-2026-21265, is a secure boot certificate expiration security feature bypass vulnerability, with a 6.4 CVSS rating. It&#39;s listed as publicly known because Microsoft published this certificate expiration notice back in June 2025.

Some of the original certificates issued in 2011 are expiring soon, and operators of devices that use the soon-to-expire certificates need to update them – or lose the operating system&#39;s Secure Boot protections and security updates. As Childs noted, &quot;while unlikely to be exploited, this bug could cause quite a bit of headaches for administrators.&quot;

The other publicly known vulnerability, CVE-2023-31096, is a 7.8-rated elevation of privilege flaw in third-party Agere Modem drivers that ship with supported Windows versions. It&#39;s a non-Microsoft CVE that has to do with a flaw first documented in 2023 (CVE-2023-31096) and issued by MITRE.

During October&#39;s patch-a-thon, Microsoft warned that this Agere Modem driver security hole had been made public, but not yet exploited, and said it would be removed in a future update. The future is now, and the drivers have been removed as of the January update.

A couple of other interesting bugs that Childs points out are these two, CVE-2026-20952 (CVSS 7.7) and CVE-2026-20953 (CVSS 7.4), both use-after-free Office flaws that can allow an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally.

&quot;Another month with Preview Pane exploit vectors in an Office bug,&quot; Childs wrote. &quot;While we are still unaware of any exploitation of these bugs, they keep adding up. It&#39;s only a matter of time until threat actors find a way to use these types of bugs in their exploits.&quot; ®

            <h2>Memory shortage could push PC shipments to pre-pandemic lows</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/13/idc_pc_sales_memory_shortage_effects/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The rising cost of memory due to shortages is likely to persist into late 2027, driving higher device prices and lackluster configurations for PCs, tablets, and phones, IDC research manager Jitesh Ubrani told The Register.

“We had assumed this would be primarily a 2026 story. More and more, particularly at CES, we had conversations with folks and they’re saying ‘You won’t find price stability in memory up until maybe late 2027.’ It means that prices will stop rising. Not that they’re going to drop. That’s what we’re hearing,” he told us on Tuesday. “This could be much longer than we had previously anticipated. Not just we at IDC, but we as a collective market.”

The PC market had a strong rebound in 2025, with device shipments totaling 284.7 million, driven by product refreshes and the end of support for Windows 10. The fourth quarter was particularly strong with 76.4 million devices shipped, up 9.6 percent year over year. For the full year, 2025 saw an 8.1 percent rise in PC shipments worldwide.

But part of that success comes from suppliers stockpiling inventory ahead of a looming memory shortage, Ubrani told The Register.

“Ultimately, it ended up far ahead of what anyone had hoped for. And given where things are today, it might be like the last good year we have for the next two years, or maybe even three years,” he said. “Things are kind of getting worse day by day from here on out.”

In November, IDC had already predicted the 2026 PC market could see a year-on-year decline of 2.4 percent, with a more moderate downside scenario putting the drop at 4.9 percent due to tough comparables against the PC surge last year. But a persistent memory supply crunch could push that to the most pessimistic prediction, roughly a 9 percent slide. Other analysts seem to agree it&#39;ll be a tough year.

Ubrani said that if 2026 shipments fall by 9 percent, total PC shipments would drop to about 260 million, slightly below 2024&#39;s roughly 263.3 million units and close to 2023, &quot;one of the worst years in PC history.&quot;

He added 2023 and 2016 had the same volume of shipments with about 260 million.

“2023 was one of the worst because it was after the boom brought about by the pandemic and it was a year where everyone had excess inventory,” he explained. “Now we&#39;re potentially getting back to pre-pandemic levels.”

The PCs that do arrive in 2026 are likely to be more expensive with fewer features.

Ubrani said prior to the memory crunch, many vendors considered 16 GB of RAM as the starting point of what would be considered an AI PC. Now, using cloud plus on-device memory, a computer labeled as an &quot;AI PC&quot; could come with less than that.

“You might see instances where a system doesn’t have 16 gigs and they’re still promoted as an AI PC, but it would use this hybrid AI approach, where you can do some on device, but most of it in cloud,” Ubrani said. “The marketing to end users may not say that, and consumers again, can’t really tell the difference, or won&#39;t know the difference, but on the enterprise side, you will see the messaging change away from ‘on device AI.’ ”

During their most recent earnings calls, Lenovo, HP, and Dell all reassured investors they were capable of maneuvering through the looming memory shortages, but both Dell and HP said it would mean higher prices.

Dell’s COO Jeff Clarke, who took over leadership of that company’s PC division in 2025, said on the November call that this is the seventh DRAM supply shortage in the last 40 years that he has seen. The last one “of this magnitude” he said was between 2016 and 2017.

“It’s unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we’ve seen. And by the way, it’s not unique to DRAM. It’s NAND. It is hard drives, leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network,” he told analysts.

Clarke said higher device costs are on the way, as well as bleaker configurations.

HP CEO Enrique Lores echoed that sentiment during that company’s November earnings call, saying that if the memory market doesn’t improve, expect higher PC costs in the second half of 2026.

Ubrani said Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Apple will face challenges, but their scale and relationship with chipmakers will insulate them. The vendors facing the most peril are smaller players such as Acer, Asus, and MSI.

“Even if they do get the memory, their prices are going to be so high that their finished PCs are going to be so expensive that their customers won’t buy it. So these are real challenges to be had, kind of across the board,” he said. “That’s why, again, a Lenovo, an Apple, they’re in a very good position, but even they’ve mentioned price hikes. So it&#39;s going to be a challenging environment going forward.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vulnerabilities in popular AI and ML Python libraries used in Hugging Face models with tens of millions of downloads allow remote attackers to hide malicious code in metadata. The code then executes automatically when a file containing the poisoned metadata is loaded.

The open source libraries - NeMo, Uni2TS, and FlexTok - were created by Nvidia, Salesforce, and Apple working with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology&#39;s Visual Intelligence and Learning Lab (EPFL VILAB), respectively.

All three libraries use Hydra, another Python library maintained by Meta and commonly used as a configuration management tool for machine learning projects. Specifically, the vulnerabilities involve Hydra&#39;s instantiate() function.

Palo Alto Networks&#39; Unit 42 spotted the security flaws and reported them to the libraries&#39; maintainers, who have since issued security warnings, fixes and, in two cases, CVEs. While the threat hunters say they haven&#39;t seen any in-the-wild abuse of these vulnerabilities to date, &quot;there is ample opportunity for attackers to leverage them.&quot;

&quot;It is common for developers to create their own variations of state-of-the-art models with different fine-tunings and quantizations, often from researchers unaffiliated with any reputable institution,&quot; Unit 42 malware research engineer Curtis Carmony wrote in a Tuesday analysis. &quot;Attackers would just need to create a modification of an existing popular model, with either a real or claimed benefit, and then add malicious metadata.&quot;

Plus, Hugging Face doesn&#39;t make the metadata contents as easily accessible as it does with other files, nor does it flag files using its safetensors or NeMo file formats as potentially unsafe.

Models on Hugging Face use more than 100 different Python libraries, and almost 50 of these use Hydra. &quot;While these formats on their own may be secure, there is a very large attack surface in the code that consumes them,&quot; Carmony wrote.

The Register reached out to Hugging Face along with the libraries&#39; maintainers (Meta, Nvidia, Salesforce, and Apple), and only received one response. It came from a Salesforce spokesperson who told us: &quot;We proactively remediated the issue in July 2025 and have no evidence of unauthorized access to customer data.&quot;

We will update this story if we hear back from any of the other companies.

As mentioned earlier, the vulnerabilities have to do with the way the  NeMo, Uni2TS, and FlexTok use the hydra.utils.instantiate() function to load configurations from model metadata, which allows for remote code execution (RCE).

The creators or maintainers of these libraries appear to have overlooked the fact instantiate() doesn&#39;t just accept the name of classes to instantiate. It also takes the name of any callable and passes it the provided arguments.

By leveraging this, an attacker can more easily achieve RCE using built-in Python functions like eval() and os.system().

Meta has since updated Hydra&#39;s documentation with a warning that states RCE is possible when using instantiate() and urges users to add a block-list mechanism that compares the  the _target_ value against a list of dangerous functions before it is called. As of now, however, the block-list mechanism hasn&#39;t been made available in a Hydra release.

Here&#39;s a closer look at three of the AI/ML libraries that use Hydra&#39;s instantiate() function and the related vulnerabilities.

NeMo is a PyTorch-based framework that Nvidia created in 2019. Its .nemo and .qnemo file extensions - TAR files containing a model_config.yaml file - store model metadata along with a .pt file or a .safetensors file, respectively.

The problem here is that the metadata isn&#39;t sanitized before these NeMo files make an API call to hydra.utils.instantiate(), and this allows an attacker to load .nemo files with maliciously crafted metadata, trigger the vulnerability, and achieve RCE or tamper with data.

Nvidia issued CVE-2025-23304 to track the high-severity bug and released a fix in NeMo version 2.3.2

NeMo also integrates with Hugging Face, and an attacker could follow the same code path to exploit this vulnerability once the model is downloaded.

According to Unit 42, more than 700 models on Hugging Face from a variety of developers are provided in NeMo&#39;s file format.

Uni2TS is a PyTorch library created by Salesforce and used in its Morai foundation model for time series analysis along with a set of models published on Hugging Face.

This library works exclusively with .safetensors files, created by Hugging Face as a safe format for storing tensors, as opposed to pickle, which allows for arbitrary code execution during the loading process.

Salesforce models using these libraries have hundreds of thousands of downloads on Hugging Face, and other users have also published several adaptations of these models.

Hugging Face also provides a PyTorchModelHubMixin interface for creating custom model classes that can be integrated with the rest of its framework.

This interface provides a specific mechanism for registering coder functions, and - you guessed it - the uni2TS library uses this mechanism to decode the configuration of a specific argument via a call to hydra.utils.instantiate().

On July 31, Salesforce issued CVE-2026-22584 and deployed a fix.

Early last year, Apple and EPFL VILAB created FlexTok, a Python-based framework that enables AI/ML models to process images.

As with uni2TS, FlexTok only uses safetensors files, it extends PyTorchModelHubMixin, and it can load configuration and meta data from a .safetensors file. After it decodes the metadata, FlexTok passes it to hydra.utils.instantiate(), which triggers the vulnerability.

&quot;As of January 2026, no models on Hugging Face appear to be using the ml-flextok library other than those models published by EPFL VILAB, which have tens of thousands of downloads in total,&quot; Carmony wrote.

Apple and EPFL VILAB fixed these security issues by using YAML to parse their configurations. The maintainers also added an allow list of classes that can call Hydra&#39;s instantiate() function, and updated documentation to say only models from trusted sources should be loaded. ®

﻿A political comms professional breaks down Trump’s meme media strategy.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the technology, broligarchs and brainrot rapidly transforming politics and civic society. Not subscribed to The Verge yet? You should! It can materially improve your life.

Last week was a grim reminder that no matter what sort of horror is being perpetrated or how many people end up dead, the Trump administration’s knee-jerk response is to shitpost through it. The White House’s response on X to abducting the head of a sovereign nation? “FAFO”. The response to an ICE agent shooting a woman in broad daylight? A Buzzfeed-style listicle of “57 Times Sick, Unhinged Democrats Declared War on Law Enforcement.” ICE agents arresting protesters? “Welcome to the Find Out stage.”

To the vast majority of people following current events, the Trump administration’s meme-ing is blunt and cruel. But the jaded political insider will also view Trump’s meme fusillade as an element of a media strategy known as “rapid response”: the full-time work of quickly shaping the political narrative of a breaking news event, sometimes within minutes, before the news media and your opponents can shape it for you.

“Every political office, every political campaign, has a dedicated operation that helps them respond strategically to events in the news that are out of their control.” Lis Smith, a high-profile Democratic communications strategist based in New York City, told me. It’s a profession that dates back to the beginning of the 24-hour news cycle, when cable shows could quickly assemble a panel of pundits to discuss current events, and the workload has grown exponentially in the age of social media. “You cannot control all the narratives that are going to be out there, so you need to be able to manage the chaos that’s coming into your world.”

Smith served as the director of rapid response for Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, which was one of the first to fully take advantage of social media, and worked in the comms shop for several New York City mayors and Democratic candidates. She’s widely credited for single-handedly elevating Pete Buttigieg’s profile, turning him from an obscure mayor to a serious presidential candidate as his director of communications. She views social networks through the lens of their messaging utility: X, formerly known as Twitter, is still the best for getting “text-based rapid response communications like written statements” in front of a wide range of “elites and opinion-shapers.” A Bluesky-based messaging strategy might engage a friendly left-leaning audience, but will never “penetrate” the world outside, nor will a Rumble-based campaign ever make it out of the right-wing bubble.

More importantly: memes may be a fast way to convey a political message to a specific audience who gets the inside joke, but the humor is rarely understood by anyone outside of that group — especially people who might have been sympathetic to the concept of stopping illegal immigration, but are horrified by how the Trump administration is going about it. The memes themselves are simply a reflection of that mindset. “The administration’s use of memes really flattens the political debate,” said Smith. “It takes the humanity, the seriousness, and the nuance that’s needed out of it and replaces it just with cruelty.”

Before we get to my conversation with Smith, here’s The Verge’s latest on the political tech dystopia:

This interview has been edited for clarity.

You came up during an era where Twitter, before it was X, was really the only internet media environment for politics. How has the practice of rapid response changed in an environment where there is so much narrative to control over so many types of media?

It’s gotten a lot harder. In the ’90s, the big change was the 24-hour news cycle with cable news. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the big development was social media, Twitter, and being able to respond in real time online to news developments. But now, there’s no question that it’s harder to get your message out, with how fractured these different social media channels are. Not everyone is on X today the same way they were 10 years ago. But also, your message is less likely to penetrate as effectively on a platform like X than it was 10 years ago, because of how verification, etc., have changed.

So you really need to have an “all of the above” communication strategy, where you’re hitting traditional media with press releases, calls to reporters and news networks, and you’re also hitting social media in real time. That means not just hitting X, but also hitting Threads, hitting Bluesky, TikTok, Instagram, all those apps, because there has never been a time where people’s media consumption habits have been more fractured than right now.

Do candidates view specific platforms for certain political purposes, or political leanings?

X is still pretty dominant in American politics for getting out rapid response communications, especially text-based rapid response communications like written statements, because it’s still where you’re going to find the most political insiders, political pundits, and reporters. Everything [messaging-wise] trickles out from there. Where you see more fracturing is in terms of where people do short form video: you do see some campaigns using TikTok, others using Instagram more; you do see some favoring of different platforms across partisan lines. But Bluesky on the left is just never going to be as effective of a way of reaching elites and opinion-makers as X is — just as Truth Social or Discord on the right is never going to be the way that you reach elites or opinion-makers.

Let’s go into the content of said messaging. I know that Kamala Harris and Biden tried to lean into memes during their 2024 campaigns, but clearly not as effectively as Trump, and the meme format seems to be really dominant in the Trump administration. Is there a specific way an operative views the meme format as a political messaging tool?

The meme format is more likely to spread quickly. It’s something that a specific audience is going to understand immediately, and it really simplifies a political argument. The problem with that, though, is, one, it’s very audience specific. Not everyone is going to understand a Family Guy meme, not everyone is going to understand a Patriots meme, or whatever the meme du jour is.

Another problem with the meme format is that you lose a lot of context and you lose a lot of humanity in it. So when you see the administration posting sort-of-funny memes about deportations or ICE, you lose a lot of the empathy and compassion that most people have when it comes to the immigration debate. Most people think that illegal immigration is bad and that we should do something about it. But most people also understand that there are real people who are involved in all of these situations and don’t think it’s funny to make light of, say, school pickups getting raided, or families getting separated, or parents crying as they’re being dragged away from their kids.

I was listening to Joe Rogan interviewing Shane Gillis, and they actually touched on this. I would say both Rogan and Shane Gillis are people who were favorable to Trump in the election — Rogan more so than Shane Gillis — but Gillis said, I want our government to take the issue of illegal immigration seriously. I don’t want it to be funny to them. And I think that’s something that really taps into how most people feel about these issues.

If you reduce these very serious issues to cruel, funny memes, you’re going to alienate a lot of people who might be there with you on an issue if you’d approached it with a little bit more maturity and humanity. But the administration is saying, cut out the humanity, cut out the maturity. Those things don’t matter. Because a viral meme — a meme that is funny or cruel — will probably spread faster than anything with nuance. They’re prioritizing speed and virality over nuance and seriousness.

I think you just refined what we’ve been thinking about at The Verge: the way that my coworkers saw Trump’s abduction of Maduro and their response to the ICE shooting was that this government’s policy is a meme mentality — their speed, virality and the need to get their spin out first before anyone feels any sort of way about it.

There’s a short window when people — everyone from reporters to voters to anyone online — are trying to figure out what the hell’s going on and what they think about breaking news. Rapid response is about stepping into that void and shaping it, but there are real problems with how the Trump administration is doing it. Ultimately, yes, they may win some sort of short-term viral meme war. But in the long term, the way that they’re communicating about these issues — whether it’s the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, or deportations in general — they’re gonna lose the political debate. People want action on these issues, but they don’t want wanton cruelty.

Also, if you [the administration[ step in very quickly and put out bad facts, what you do is just compound mistrust in government and mistrust in the administration. And it’s possible that the Trump administration benefits from that because the less people trust official sources, the more it’s good for them. But I think overall, it’s pretty bad that they’re putting out false information that goes mega-viral the way they do it, because ultimately, no one’s going to take anything they say at face value anymore. It’s especially damaging for their relationships with the news media and elites who, in the past, would have clearly taken what any presidential administration said at face value.

Is it too early to think about meme warfare in the midterm election — changing people’s opinions who could be swayed to vote one way or another, getting that messaging to them as quickly as possible, driving them out to the polls?

I don’t think that the meme strategy from this administration is gonna help Republicans in the midterms. And I think if you talk to a lot of Republicans who are up in swing areas or swing states or certain districts, and you presented them with the memes this administration is putting out, I don’t think they would agree with them, and I don’t think that they would say that this is good political strategy. Because to the point I made earlier: the administration’s use of memes really flattens the political debate. It takes the humanity, the seriousness, the nuance that’s needed out of it, and replaces it just with cruelty. The voters who are going to turn out in 2026 — yeah, some of them are going to be part of that MAGA base that it embraces the cruelty, but the people that you need to win over are going to be people who have nuanced views on issues like illegal immigration and people who say, Yeah, we need secure borders; yes, we need more enforcement of our immigration laws; but maybe we don’t need to be putting out memes about, you know, a father being taken off in handcuffs.

That’s where I think the administration’s focus on speed and virality comes at a political cost. Someone’s’s going to have to pay for the tone that they’re taking online, and it’s likely going to be the Republicans who are up in 2026, unless, I don’t know, Democrats somehow overplay their hand on immigration issues.

And a lot of the voters who will determine the midterm elections are older voters. They’re not going to consume the memes firsthand, nor are they going to understand the memes. That’s something being lost in this debate too: even though more people than ever are getting their news through social media, a lot of the people who decide elections, and a lot of the people that Republicans need to win, are not meme consumers. It’s questionable whether it will pay off electorally for them.

Speaking of memes distilling political arguments:

The car mat CEO has committed to US-based manufacturing.

President Donald Trump made an unconventional pick for his nomination to the Federal Trade Commission: WeatherTech founder and CEO David MacNeil.

MacNeil founded the company, which makes weather-resistant car floor mats, in 1989, according to its website, and he owns 100 percent of the company. WeatherTech has made it a mission to keep its manufacturing and workforce in the US. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson congratulated MacNeil on X and called him an “outstanding businessman and great patriot,” sharing a clip from a news segment where MacNeil shared his commitment to manufacturing in the US. If confirmed, MacNeil become the third member of the panel, taking the seat formerly held by Melissa Holyoak, who is now a US Attorney in Utah.

MacNeil’s background is somewhat unusual for an FTC commissioner. Many come from legal and academic, or have experience working on Capitol Hill. MacNeil is a reported billionaire who recently bought a $75 million mansion in a town near Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. He’s a Republican donor who has supported Trump, though notably in 2018 threatened to withhold donations from candidates who refused to support the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Still, his experience may fit with some of the FTC’s current enforcement and regulatory goals, such as enforcing the Made in the USA Labeling Rule, to prevent deceptive marketing. MacNeil will need to be confirmed by the Senate, where Democrats will likely take issue with Trump’s failure to nominate Democrats to the typically-five member panel after firing two of them against Supreme Court precedent.

Including cases that protect your Switch 2 as you play, and others that can keep it scratch-free during transit.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

You might find it kind of sad to put your hard-earned Switch 2 into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Sure, it can take away from the slick design. But using a case relieves me of the worry that the console will accumulate tons of little scratches, or worse. I’ve tested several types of cases on the Nintendo Switch 2 since it launched in June, including flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I’ve also tested carrying cases that protect the console when it isn’t in use.

It didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best, but that hasn’t stopped me from trying new options from brands that are familiar, as well as from companies that aren’t household names. There’s something for everyone — and every budget — below.

We use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don’t perform drop tests (I’m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.

Installing a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2’s hybrid design, a multi-step process is expected, but it should be easy to install the case every time with little effort.

Since many gadget cases are made before said technology is publicly available, I make sure the cases that I test actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference isn’t good enough for me or you.

Some protective cases come with compromises, like preventing you from detaching the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want a case that doesn’t block the Switch 2’s unique features, so I’ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, except where noted otherwise.

I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for carrying cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or ideally both.

As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.

Very secure fitMakes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)Clever dock adapter

Chunky dock adapterNot the most affordable caseFront protection only comes in the $80 tier

The least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a set of Joy-Con 2 grips, a rear cover for the console and a small matching piece to adhere to its kickstand, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes one of Dbrand’s skins. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off.

Unfortunately, the protective case makes it impossible to fit the Switch 2 into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into the dock, essentially acting as an extender for it’s USB-C jack. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.

The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent cover that protects the front of your console when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.

When this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their magnet-releasing buttons. In other words, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips. We’ve received the tweaked pieces and can confirm that they fix the issue.

The Jsaux Split Protective Case is an affordable alternative to Dbrand’s Killswitch, costing $29.99 but with many of the same characteristics. It includes two Joy-Con 2 grips that let you detach them from the system at will, and a transparent shell to clip around the back and the top and bottom edges of the Switch 2. Unlike the Killswitch, however, the Jsaux shell is so thin that the console can still fit into the dock. It also comes with a hard front cover that protect the screen during transit (or just for safekeeping), and it has storage for 10 Switch cartridges on its underside.

I’ve got minor qualms with Jsaux’s case, which I can overlook given its low price (and may not be an issue for you, anyway); the Joy-Con 2 grips are smaller, and don’t add as much bulk or grip as Dbrand’s Killswitch, but they’re still serviceable. Also, its build quality isn’t as good (for instance, on my review unit, there was a little bit of warped plastic that looks like a raised eyebrow near the power and volume buttons, though it’s hard to say if this affects multiple units).

Lastly, the design of its Joy-Con 2 grips exhibit the same edge case issue that Dbrand’s model initially faced before it issued a free fix to all owners. If you hold the Switch 2 by either Joy-Con and shake the console’s full weight downward, the force may be enough to completely detach it, sending the console down to the ground. In my testing, it was really difficult to get the Switch 2 to fall, so this hopefully shouldn’t impact many people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless.

Another runner-up is the ModCase from Jsaux. The foundation of the accessory pack is the plastic and silicone case that the console fits into (you can’t remove the Joy-Con or use the kickstand once it’s inside), which adds bulkier grips that make it more comfortable to hold. There’s a small section on the rear of the case that juts out, and that’s where each of its “mods” can be attached.

The basic $29.99 kit includes just a couple of basics: a kickstand (which works better on tables than laps) and a watch-like strap for holding a power bank during charging. The $59.99 Ultimate kit that Jsaux sent for testing includes those plus several other extras. You get a face plate for the console to protect its screen while not in use, as well as an accessory with a magnet to let you attach, say, your iPhone so you can view it while you play games. Lastly, it includes a USB-C dock extender with a silicone stand. It’s like a dock for your dock, for use when the ModCase is installed. It looks more cumbersome than Dbrand’s also-clumsy-looking solution included with the Killswitch. But, hey, it all works as intended performance-wise.

Tomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it includes color options that look like ice cream sandwiches.

The FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. While Belkin’s Switch 2 carrying case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is a soft screen-protecting flap that can hold 12 Switch cartridges on the other side.

WaterField Designs has been making tweaks to its beloved, but pricey CitySlicker case for every major handheld to come along. For fans of the case, or those who are looking for a more premium option, the $129 Switch 2 version doesn’t change what isn’t broken. The City Slicker hugs the console’s curves closely enough to ensure a snug fit with a fleece interior, flanked by two pockets for cables and small accessories -- one in front of where the Switch 2 sits, and one behind it. There’s a larger zip-up mesh pocket on its back.

High-quality materials set this case apart from the others on this list, and unsurprisingly are what drives up the cost. It features leather on the flap covering the system and around the front of the case. For the secondary material, you have the option of waxed canvas or ballistic nylon. If you want your Switch 2 to sleep in style, this would make for a great gift to yourself or to another game. However, the City Slicker likely won’t protect your console as much as a tougher zip-up or cover case can. Not to mention, you may prefer a case with more cartridge slots than the five that are punched out of this case’s luxe leather.

Power A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried.

At just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).

This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.

For $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.

Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.

The Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.

If you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.

The $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around nearly every nook of the Switch 2, leaving access to its headphone jack, USB-C ports, and speakers (it doesn’t cover up the air vents either because that’d be silly). It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its dock.

Belkin is sending over its new Charging Case Pro for testing. The company debuted this new model at CES 2026, and it features some thoughtful upgrades compared to the $70 charging case that includes a battery. Namely, you don’t have to connect the Switch 2 and the battery together via a cable. Just nestle the Switch 2 into the kickstand-meets-cradle. The case also features a screen that shows battery percentage remaining, and an external USB-C port for easily recharging the case.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Nia DaCosta’s 28 Years Later sequel turns the franchise on its head with a story about spirituality in the end times.

﻿Nia DaCosta’s 28 Years Later sequel turns the franchise on its head with a story about spirituality in the end times.

Because there was such a long gap between the releases of 28 Weeks Later and 28 Years Later, it was surprising to hear that writer-director duo Alex Garland and Danny Boyle already had plans for their latest collaboration to be the first chapter of a new horror trilogy. Sony seemed keen on fast-tracking the pair’s idea, as 28 Years Later and its sequel began shooting back to back. But it also felt like the studio wanted to bring a different kind of energy into the franchise when it tapped Nia DaCosta to direct the new film.

That energy and its distinctness from Boyle’s directorial voice is palpable in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple — a film that understands how much more potent horror is when it’s laced with goofy humor. Though there’s no shortage of gore and stomach-turning violence, leaning into comedy is one of the movie’s more clever ways of illustrating what its characters are fighting for. Each of The Bone Temple’s jokes is a reminder of how, in a world full of flesh-eating ghouls, human connection and community are the kinds of things people are willing to die for.

The Bone Temple picks up soon after 28 Years Later to find teenager Spike (Alfie Williams) trying to make sense of his life as a newly inducted member of Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal’s (Jack O’Connell) roving cult of platinum blonde wig-wearing droogs who all go by “Jimmy.” Spike can handle himself alright against a couple of the infected lurking in the English wilderness, but his skills with a bow and arrow are nothing compared to the Jimmys’ ultraviolent approach to dealing with anything that crosses their path.

Murdering people — infected or not — at Jimmy Crystal’s command has become second nature for Jimmy Ink (Erin Kellyman), Jimmima (Emma Laird), and the rest of their demented crew. Spike finds it hard to buy Jimmy Crystal’s claims of being spoken to and directed by a higher, unseen power, but he knows that he has no choice but to join the gang and dress up like a sexual predator when they ask him to join their ranks.

It’s through the Jimmys as a unit that 28 Years Later starts exploring the ways that faith can be weaponized to harm the very same people that it provides psychological comfort to. The Jimmys are a twisted family bound by a genuine fondness for one another and an understanding that they’re safer as a group. But the movie presents their willingness to follow Jimmy Crystal as being born out of fear and a more general gullibility caused by society’s collapse.

One of the most striking things about O’Connell’s performance is how — for all of Jimmy Crystal’s psychopathy and moments of delusion — he makes the character come across as a scared boy trapped inside an unhinged man’s body. The movie says as much through Jimmy’s frequent mentions of the Teletubbies and the way he insists that his father, Satan, is whispering commands into his ear. Jimmy’s delusional rantings are convincing to his relatively young followers because they have grown up in a world where level-minded authority figures who can teach them fact from fiction are few and far between. But the cult leader’s bluster is less effective when it’s aimed at older people with more life experience and memories of the pre-plague world, like Dr. Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes).

It’s through Kelson that The Bone Temple starts to ask and answer a number of fascinating questions about those infected with the plague virus, like Samson (Chi Lewis-Parry), the hulking, spine-ripping Alpha introduced in 28 Years Later. The new movie spends much more time with these returning characters to give us a better understanding of what their lives have been like and how they’ve both been changed by meeting one another. Fiennes and Lewis-Parry are tremendous together as The Bone Temple moves Kelson and Samson closer in ways that are surprising, alarming, and unexpectedly funny. But as much levity as the pair bring to this story, The Bone Temple also uses them to remind you what humanity has lost in the 28 years since the Rage contagion got loose.

Whereas 28 Years Later felt very much like a film that was in conversation with zombie narratives inspired by 28 Days Later, The Bone Temple draws much of its inspiration from older pieces of the undead canon. DaCosta punctuates scenes of Samson’s berserker hunt for flesh with unsettling moments of stillness and tight, nauseating shots of him cracking skulls open to scarf down his victims’ brains. In the context of the movie, Samson is a new kind of infected — one with more intelligence and the ability to socialize with others like him. But as a screen presence, the character comes across a lot like a tribute to the shambling corpses that made George Romero a cinematic icon.

Though DaCosta inherited much of this story from Boyle and Garland’s last collaboration, she makes it her own by leaning into a less frenetic style of visual storytelling. Some of the movie’s biggest scares work because of how slowly they’re revealed. But just when it seems like the movie is at its most disturbing, DaCosta defuses some of that tension with a handful of perfectly placed needle drops.

It was hard to get a sense of how 28 Years Later might grow into a compelling trilogy. But The Bone Temple makes it clear that Boyle and Garland have been cooking with heat from the very beginning of this new chapter of the larger franchise. DaCosta masterfully sets up a number of promising developments for the trilogy’s conclusion, which will see Boyle return to wrap things up. And if the next film manages to inject a similar level of life into the undead genre, it will all have been worth the wait.

28 Days Later: The Bone Temple also stars Louis Ashbourne Serkis, Maura Bird, Ghazi Al Ruffai, Sam Locke, and Cillian Murphy. The film hits theaters on January 16th.

            <div id="article-text">It comes amid the global uproar over X’s mass AI undressing of users on its platform.

It comes amid the global uproar over X’s mass AI undressing of users on its platform.

The Senate passed a bill that could give people who’ve found their likeness deepfaked into sexually-explicit images without their consent a new way to fight back.

The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act (DEFIANCE Act), would let victims sue the individuals who created the images for civil damages. The bill passed with unanimous consent — meaning there was no roll-call vote, and no Senator objected to its passage on the floor Tuesday. It’s meant to build on the work of the Take It Down Act, a law that criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) and requires social media platforms to promptly remove them.

The passage comes as policymakers around the world have threatened action against X for enabling users to create nonconsensual and sexually suggestive AI images with its Grok chatbot. X owner Elon Musk has shrugged off blame onto the individuals prompting Grok, writing, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” But even after pushback, X continued to let users prompt Grok to virtually strip people down.

Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), a lead sponsor of the bill, referenced Grok’s nonconsensual undressing in remarks on the Senate floor. “Even after these terrible deepfake, harming images are pointed out to Grok and to X, formerly Twitter, they do not respond. They don’t take the images off of the internet. They don’t come to the rescue of people who are victims,” Durbin said. Though the Take It Down Act, whose takedown provision goes into full force later this year, could have implications for X, the DEFIANCE Act would impact individuals, like those Grok users creating deepfaked nonconsensual intimate imagery.

Governments around the world are creating new protections against AI-generated nonconsensual images, spurred in part by the recent Grok controversy. The UK, for example, recently pushed up a law that criminalizes the creation of nonconsensual intimate deepfakes.

The DEFIANCE Act similarly passed the Senate in 2024 following a different nonconsensual deepfake scandal on X. Early that year, sexually explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift circulated on the platform. Durbin along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the bill to expand on a provision in the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, which gave people whose non-AI generated intimate images were shared without consent a right to sue. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has found her own image digitally altered in nonconsensual intimate deepfakes, sponsored the bill in the House. The bill stalled in the House without a vote during the last Congress, requiring the Senate to take it up again this year. Now the ball is again in the House leadership’s court; if they decide to bring the bill to the floor, it will have to pass in order to reach the president’s desk.

Flagship phones cost a small fortune these days. We can help you pick the right one and get the most for your money.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Haven’t you heard? Phones are boring now. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below.

But even if you’re looking for something a little more extra, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can still find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that offers full water and dust resistance, there are flip phones that offer more than just nostalgia, and you can still buy a phone with no fewer than four cameras on the back. There are even a few that offer fun styles. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware. And stay tuned — if CES 2026 was anything to go by, there may be some even more interesting phones in our future.

A lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — it’s how I bought mine. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates are a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.

Most phone cameras perform well in good lighting, from flagship models to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to improve low-light performance is a must in this category.

The very best devices carry robust IP68 ratings, durable glass on the front and back, and sturdy aluminum exterior frames.

In addition to the very best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to recommending a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price, or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.

If you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $600. For those recommendations, check out our guide to budget smartphones.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe (Qi2) / Weather-resistance: IP68

This year’s standard iPhone offers a handful of major upgrades over its predecessor, including a larger 6.3-inch screen with a 120Hz panel and an always-on display. These two features make the everyday experience meaningfully better, but they’re not the only ones: you also get faster performance, better battery life, and twice the amount of base storage at 256GB. It also has the same starting price of $799, which is a shockingly great deal.

On the camera front, the iPhone 17’s new 48-megapixel ultrawide matches the Pro’s resolution, delivering sharper, more vibrant shots, while the main camera remains reliably good in most conditions. It also features the Pro’s 18-megapixel selfie camera, which lets you take horizontal shots without rotating the device. If you care about zoom or portraits, the iPhone 17’s lack of a telephoto camera is the clearest reason to go Pro. For most people, though, the device’s 2x “optical quality” zoom will be fine for everyday snaps, making it a great upgrade.

Qi2 wireless charging with magnets is greatAI is actually kind of useful, finallyTelephoto camera is a nice addition

Main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the ProBattery life is just okay

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP68

The Pixel 10 is an easygoing Android phone that offers some handy upgrades over its predecessor. The addition of Qi2 with built-in magnets is a delight, making it easier than ever to quickly charge up without plugging in. AI features like Magic Cue, which can proactively suggest information based on what you’re doing on your phone, are finally showing promise. And for the first time ever, the base model features a dedicated telephoto lens.

But, alas, there’s a catch: The Pixel 10 no longer features the same main and ultrawide camera hardware as the Pro. You’re essentially getting the two rear cameras found in the midrange Pixel 9A, plus a telephoto lens. Still, as a whole, the device’s triple camera system produces images that are totally fine. Beyond the cameras, the Pixel 10 features the same Tensor G5 chipset that’s found in the Pro phones — handy for those aforementioned AI features.

Overall, the Pixel 10 mostly improves upon what made last year’s Pixel 9 such a solid release. We’re not thrilled with the downgraded camera, but the addition of Qi2 and a telephoto lens helps to soften the blow. If you can live with the camera tradeoffs, the Pixel 10 is still a smart pick for anyone who wants a flagship experience at a more approachable price.

Excellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfier

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless, Qi2 ready / Weather resistance: IP68

Samsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it.

This year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy, and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.

Robust IP68 ratingSeven years of software updatesBrighter, bigger screen

Missing a couple of AI featuresAI is occasionally handy, usually weird

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance: IP68

Every year, we’re pleasantly surprised by how much Google packs into its midrange Pixel A-series devices. In 2024, it was the Pixel 8A, and last year, it was the even better Pixel 9A. For $500 (and very often, less), the 9A offers Google’s fourth-gen custom Tensor G4 chipset (the very same chip that’s in the pricier Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro), a brighter and larger 6.3-inch OLED display, and an IP68 rating for improved durability. Plus, you get the benefit of seven years of software updates and security support. What you end up with is a device that delivers fantastic value, especially compared to other inexpensive devices.

The Pixel 9A offers a handful of other features that put it above the pack, like a 120Hz refresh rate, wireless charging, and the largest battery across the Pixel line. It does fall short in a few areas, though — the camera’s low light performance and Portrait mode could be better. That said, the 9A’s camera is still great for everyday snaps, and for the price, the device is an easy recommendation as the best in this category.

Solid battery lifeBrighter screen outdoorsCenter Stage cameraFaster chargingDoesn’t get blazing hotOrange

What’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe (Qi2) / Weather-resistance: IP68

The iPhone 17 Pro is the model to get if you want Apple’s most capable camera system and the longest battery life you can get in an iPhone. All three rear sensors use 48-megapixel lenses — including the telephoto with 4x zoom — and support creator-focused tools like ProRes RAW. Apple’s switch to an aluminum body with a vapor chamber also helps keep temperatures low during intensive tasks, including high-res video recording, while the Ceramic Shield 2 front improves durability. And it’s all wrapped in a fresh, rounded design.

As part of that redesign, Apple carved out the frame to fit a larger battery, which lasts through a typical day of mixed use while browsing social media, gaming, etc. The 17 Pro supports 40W wired charging and slightly faster MagSafe charging, allowing you to take it from zero to 50 percent in as little as 20 minutes. It also supports USB 3 for lightning-fast transfer speeds, so you can quickly copy over all your vacation photos and videos to your laptop.

Since the standard iPhone 17 has the same 120Hz refresh rate and an always‑on display, it’s easier to skip the Pro this year. That being said, if you want longer battery life and the most flexible camera system in the lineup, the 17 Pro is the way to go. Plus, it comes in a bold orange shade that’s unlike anything else in Apple’s lineup.

Samsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable camera

More susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48

Samsung finally got the memo with the Galaxy Z Flip 7’s cover screen. The company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look of its predecessor for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. With more outer screen real estate, it’s easier to respond to texts and punch in a coffee order without flipping open the phone and getting sucked into a digital rabbit hole.

The Flip 7 still makes you jump through a few hoops if you want to run full apps on the cover screen, but once you’ve wrangled the settings, it unlocks a lot of convenience for everyday tasks. That said, the cover screen isn’t perfect for every app. Sometimes a button hides behind the camera cutout, forcing you to change the app’s window size. But most tasks are a breeze, and opening the phone is always an option.

Under the hood, Samsung swapped out Qualcomm’s processor for an in-house Exynos chip, though we didn’t notice any hits to performance. The new 4,300mAh battery will last you all day with moderate use, but heavy gaming and hotspot use will significantly impact battery life. The camera system, meanwhile, remains unchanged from the Z Flip 6, which isn’t a bad thing. You still get a 50-megapixel main shooter and all the fun flex mode tricks, which are great for capturing candids.

Unfortunately, the Flip 7 still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, which might work their way into the hinge and cause damage. This raises concerns about how the device might hold up over time. But Samsung’s beefed-up warranty and repair program can provide extra peace of mind. Plus, with seven years of OS and security updates, the Flip 7 should prove reliable until you decide to upgrade.

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather resistance: IP68

Concerns over long-term durability have kept us from recommending foldables to anyone but the most diehard gadget nerd. Then Google said “hold my USB-C cable” and bestowed an IP68 rating on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, making it the first foldable to provide full water and dust resistance. That means the device can survive a tumble on the beach without the hinge and inner screen failing. What’s more, the device features Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging. And with a new Tensor G5 chip, it offers smooth performance, whether you’re playing intensive games like Diablo Immortal or multitasking on the larger inner display.

As much as we love the 10 Pro Fold’s improved durability, its cameras can’t quite keep up with those of other 10 Pro models. The device is also heavy and rather chunky; it’s over 40 grams heavier than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and nearly 2 millimeters thicker when folded shut. There’s a plus side to the thicker frame, though: it leaves more room for the phone’s larger battery, which can last a full day with minimal use of the inner display. If you find yourself spending most of your time using the larger display, you may need to find the nearest outlet by the end of the day.

Update, January 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability, removed mention of the OnePlus 13R, and added info about the Samsung Z TriFold and the OnePlus 15R. Brandon Russell and Barbara Krasnoff also contributed to this post.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/chatgpt-health-has-arrived">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.
