            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward this weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad.

The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth.

“This is the start of a very long journey,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “We ended our last human exploration of the moon on Apollo 17.”

The Artemis II mission will set several notable human spaceflight records. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen will travel farther from Earth than any human in history. They won’t land. That distinction will fall to the next mission in line in NASA’s Artemis program.

But the Artemis II astronauts will travel more than 4,000 miles beyond the far side of the Moon (the exact distance depends on the launch date), setting up for a human spaceflight speed record during their blazing reentry over the Pacific Ocean a few days later. Koch will become the first woman to fly to the vicinity of the Moon, and Hansen will be the first non-US astronaut to do the same.

“We really are ready to go,” said Wiseman, the Artemis II commander, during Saturday’s rollout to the launch pad. “We were in a sim [in Houston] for about 10 hours yesterday doing our final capstone entry and landing sim. We got in T-38s last night and we flew to the Cape to be here for this momentous occasion.”

The rollout began around sunrise Saturday, with NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule riding a mobile launch platform and a diesel-powered crawler transporter along a throughway paved with crushed Alabama river rock. Employees, VIPs, and guests gathered along the crawlerway to watch the 11 million-pound stack inch toward the launch pad. The rollout concluded about an hour after sunset, when the crawler transporter’s jacking system lowered the mobile launch platform onto pedestals at Pad 39B.

The rollout keeps the Artemis II mission on track for liftoff as soon as next month, when NASA has a handful of launch opportunities on February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11.

The big milestone leading up to launch day will be a practice countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), currently slated for around February 2, when NASA’s launch team will pump more than 750,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the rocket. NASA had trouble keeping the cryogenic fluids at the proper temperature, then encountered hydrogen leaks when the launch team first tried to fill the rocket for the unpiloted Artemis I mission in 2022. Engineers implemented the same fixes on Artemis II that they used to finally get over the hump with propellant loading on Artemis I.

So, what are the odds NASA can actually get the Artemis II mission off the ground next month?

“We’ll have to have things go right,” said Matt Ramsey, NASA’s Artemis II mission manager, in an interview with Ars on Saturday. “There’s a day of margin there for weather. There’s some time after WDR that we’ve got for data reviews and that sort of thing. It’s not unreasonable, but I do think it’s a success-oriented schedule.”

The Moon has to be in the right position in its orbit for the Artemis II launch to proceed. There are also restrictions on launch dates to ensure the Orion capsule returns to Earth and reenters the atmosphere at an angle safe for the ship’s heat shield. If the launch does not happen in February, NASA has a slate of backup launch dates in early March.

Ars was at Kennedy Space Center for the rocket’s move to the launch pad Saturday. The photo gallery below shows the launcher emerging from the Vehicle Assembly Building, the same facility once used to stack Saturn V rockets during the Apollo Moon program. The Artemis II astronauts were also on hand for a question and answer session with reporters.

The first flight of astronauts on the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft is running at least five years late. The flight’s architecture, trajectory, and goals have changed multiple times, and technical snags discovered during manufacturing and testing repeatedly shifted the schedule. The program’s engineering and budgetary problems are well documented.

But the team readying the rocket and spacecraft for launch has hit a stride in recent months. Technicians inside the Vehicle Assembly Building started stacking the SLS rocket in late 2024, beginning with the vehicle’s twin solid-fueled boosters. Then ground teams added the core stage, upper stage, and finally installed the Orion spacecraft on top of the rocket last October.

Working nearly around the clock in three shifts, it took about 12 months for crews at Kennedy to assemble the rocket and prepare it for rollout. But the launch campaign inside the VAB was remarkably smooth. Ground teams shaved about two months off the time it took to integrate the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for the Artemis I mission, which launched on the program’s first full-up unpiloted test flight in 2022.

“About a year ago, I was down here and we set the rollout date, and we hit it within a day or two,” said Matt Ramsey, NASA’s mission manager for Artemis II. “Being able to stay on schedule, it was a daily grind to be able to do that.”

Engineers worked through a handful of technical problems last year, including an issue with a pressure-assisted device used to assist the astronauts in opening the Orion hatch in the event of an emergency. More recently, NASA teams cleared a concern with caps installed on the rocket’s upper stage, according to Ramsey.

The most significant engineering review focused on proving the Orion heat shield is safe to fly. That assessment occurred in the background from the perspective of the technicians working on Artemis II at Kennedy.

The Artemis II team is now focused on activities at the launch pad. This week, NASA plans to perform a series of tests extending and retracting the crew access arm. Next, the Artemis II astronauts will rehearse an emergency evacuation from the launch pad. That will be followed by servicing of the rocket’s hydraulic steering system.

All of this leads up to the crucial practice countdown early next month. The astronauts won’t be aboard the rocket for the test, but almost everything else will look like launch day. The countdown will halt around 30 seconds prior to the simulated liftoff.

It took repeated tries to get through the Wet Dress Rehearsal for the Artemis I mission. There were four attempts at the countdown practice run before the first actual Artemis I launch countdown. After encountering hydrogen leaks on two scrubbed launch attempts, NASA performed another fueling test before finally successfully launching Artemis I in November 2022.

The launch team repaired a leaky hydrogen seal and introduced a gentler hydrogen loading procedure to overcome the problem. Hydrogen is an extremely efficient fuel for rockets, but its super-cold temperature and the tiny size of hydrogen molecules make it prone to leakage. The hydrogen feeds the SLS rocket’s four core-stage engines and single upper-stage engine.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s Artemis II launch director. “The things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled into the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.”

NASA is hesitant to publicly set a target launch date until the agency gets through the dress rehearsal, but agency officials say a February launch remains feasible.

“We’ve held schedule pretty well getting to rollout today,” Isaacman said. “We have zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress. But look, that’s our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared, we’ll take it.”

“Wet dress is the driver to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “With a wet dress that is without significant issues, if everything goes to plan, then certainly there are opportunities within February that could be achievable.”

One constraint that threw a wrench into NASA’s Artemis I launch campaign is no longer a significant factor for Artemis II. On Artemis I, NASA had to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) after the wet dress rehearsal to complete final installation and testing on its flight termination system, which consists of a series of pyrotechnic charges designed to destroy the rocket if it flies off course and threatens populated areas after liftoff.

The US Space Force’s Eastern Range, responsible for public safety for all launches from Florida’s Space Coast, requires the flight termination system to be retested after 28 to 35 days, a clock that started ticking last week before rollout. During Artemis I, technicians could not access the parts of the rocket they needed to in order to perform the retest at the launch pad. NASA now has structural arms to give ground teams the ability to reach parts higher up the rocket for the retest without returning to the hangar.

With this new capability, Artemis II could remain at the pad for launch opportunities in February and March before officials need to bring it back to the VAB to replace the flight termination system’s batteries, which still can’t be accessed at the pad.</div>

            <h2>The first new Marathon game in decades will launch on March 5</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/bungies-delayed-marathon-revival-will-finally-launch-march-5/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been nearly three years now since Destiny maker (and Sony subsidiary) Bungie formally announced a revival of the storied Marathon FPS franchise. And it has been about seven months since the game’s original announced release date of September 23, 2025 was pushed back indefinitely after a reportedly poor response to the game’s first Alpha test.

But today, in a post on the PlayStation Blog, Bungie revealed that the new Marathon would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the month-long March release window announced back in December.

Unlike Destiny 2, which transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019, the new Marathon sells for $40 in a Standard Edition or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar Arc Raiders, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.

Unlike the original Marathon trilogy on the ’90s Macintosh—which closely followed on the single-player campaign corridors and deathmatch multiplayer of the original Doom—the new Marathon is described as a “PvPvE survival extraction shooter.” That means gameplay based around exploring distinct zones and scavenging for cosmetics and gear upgrades in exploratory missions alone or with up to two friends, then seeing those missions “break into fast-paced PvP combat” at a moment’s notice, according to the game’s official description.

A new preorder trailer expands on other more gameplay-focused videos showcasing the poisoned world of Tau Ceti IV and the six competing factions of highly customizable “runner shells” they’ll inhabit. Bungie has also revealed a scavenging-focused “Rook” option for players that want to queue up solo and join a match in progress with nothing but a starting kit.

“Instead of focusing on progression and questing and things of that sort, [Rook] is a mode where we make it easy for you to just kind of drop into a match that’s in progress and run about and try to scavenge as much as possible and get out with it, so that you can populate your vault a little bit more for future runs,” Game Director Joe Ziegler said in a recent video.

The Marathon revival project has faced its fair share of development troubles in recent years. That includes public accusations that early test gameplay included plagiarized artwork, leading the development team to announce a “thorough review of our in-game assets.” Internal plans to release the game in 2024 were reportedly pushed back and entire year amid pessimism among developers. More recently, the game got a new creative director in June, which isn’t exactly a sign of confidence that late in a long-running project.

After all that—and given a Bungie gaming pedigree that dates back to the original Marathon—it’s fair to say that the new Marathon is going to get more than its fair share of attention when it finally gets into players’ hands in just six weeks.</div>

            <h2>Signs point to a sooner-rather-than-later M5 MacBook Pro refresh</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/signs-point-to-a-sooner-rather-than-later-m5-macbook-pro-refresh/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mac power users waiting on new high-end MacBook Pro models may have been disappointed last fall, when Apple released an M5 upgrade for the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro without touching the M4 Pro or Max versions of the laptop. But the wait for M5 Pro and M5 Max models may be nearing its end.

The tea-leaf readers at MacRumors noticed that shipping times for a handful of high-end MacBook Pro configurations have slipped into mid-to-late February, rather than being available immediately as most Mac models are. This is often, though not always, a sign that Apple has slowed down or stopped production of an existing product in anticipation of an update.

Currently, the shipping delays affect the M4 Max versions of both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. If you order them today, these models will arrive sometime between February 3 and February 24, depending on the configuration you choose; many M4 Pro versions are still available for same-day shipping, though adding a nano-texture display or upgrading RAM can still add a week or so to the shipping time.

Apple could choose to launch new Pro hardware on January 28, to go with the new Creator Studio subscription it announced last week. Aimed primarily at independent content creators that make their own video, audio, and images, the Creator Studio subscription bundles Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, and enhancements for the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps (along with some other odds and ends) for $13 a month or $130 a year. None of these apps require a MacBook Pro, but many would benefit in some way from the additional CPU and GPU power, RAM, and storage available in Apple’s high-end laptops.

Of course, an imminent replacement isn’t the only reason why the shipping estimates for any given Mac might slip. Ongoing, AI-fueled RAM shortages could be causing problems, and Apple probably prioritizes production of the widely-used base-model M4 and M5 chips to the larger, more expensive, more complex Max models.

But the only other device in Apple’s lineup that offers the M4 Max and similar RAM configuration options is the high-end Mac Studio, which currently isn’t subject to the same shipping delays. That does imply that the delays are specific to the MacBook Pro—and one explanation for this is that the laptop is about to be replaced.

Virtually every Mac in Apple’s lineup is ready for an M5-series refresh. Only the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro got an M5 upgrade last year, a relatively restrained rollout compared to the M3 and M4 generations—the M4 generation hit all the MacBook Pros, the iMac, and the Mac mini all at the same time. That’s left a lot of Macs eligible for an update at some point in 2026, including the Pros, the MacBook Airs, the Mac mini, the iMac, the Mac Studio, and the Mac Pro tower.

Apple has been known to skip Apple Silicon chip generations for some models in the past, so a handful of systems may stick with the M4 until the M6 rolls around. The MacBook Pros and Airs are reliably updated with each new chip generation, but the desktop Macs have all missed at least one chip update since the Apple Silicon era began.

Reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman also suggests that the Mac Pro may be on life support—even if an M5 Ultra chip arrives for the Mac Studio, there’s no guarantee that the Mac Pro (currently still rocking an M2 Ultra) will get the same chip.

On top of the existing Macs that we expect to see updated, Apple is rumored to be introducing an all-new Mac this year: a new entry-level model with an iPhone-class Apple A-series processor inside. This device is said to be a direct replacement for the M1 MacBook Air that Apple still sells for $599 via Walmart in the US, years after removing the model from its own retail and online stores.

Expect any replacement to share a lot in common with the old M1 Air, including its 13-inch screen size and (possibly) its paltry-by-modern-standards 8GB of RAM. But for $400 less than the starting price of the M4 MacBook Air, this low-end Mac would still serve a kind of customer that would otherwise have only Windows laptops and Chromebooks to consider.

The Walmart website currently has “low stock” of the M1 MacBook Air—it may be that we can also expect that new low-end MacBook sooner rather than later.</div>

            <h2>Elon Musk accused of making up math to squeeze $134B from OpenAI, Microsoft</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/elon-musk-accused-of-making-up-math-to-squeeze-134b-from-openai-microsoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk is going for some substantial damages in his lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and “making a fool out of him” as an early investor.

On Friday, Musk filed a notice on remedies sought in the lawsuit, confirming that he’s seeking damages between $79 billion and $134 billion from OpenAI and its largest backer, co-defendant Microsoft.

Musk hired an expert he has never used before, C. Paul Wazzan, who reached this estimate by concluding that Musk’s early contributions to OpenAI generated 50 to 75 percent of the nonprofit’s current value. He got there by analyzing four factors: Musk’s total financial contributions before he left OpenAI in 2018, Musk’s proposed equity stake in OpenAI in 2017, Musk’s current equity stake in xAI, and Musk’s nonmonetary contributions to OpenAI (like investing time or lending his reputation).

The eye-popping damage claim shocked OpenAI and Microsoft, which could also face punitive damages in a loss.

The tech giants immediately filed a motion to exclude Wazzan’s opinions, alleging that step was necessary to avoid prejudicing a jury. Their filing claimed that Wazzan’s math seemed “made up,” based on calculations the economics expert testified he’d never used before and allegedly “conjured” just to satisfy Musk.

For example, Wazzan allegedly ignored that Musk left OpenAI after leadership did not agree on how to value Musk’s contributions to the nonprofit. Problematically, Wazzan’s math depends on an imaginary timeline where OpenAI agreed to Musk’s 2017 bid to control 51.2 percent of a new for-profit entity that was then being considered. But that never happened, so it’s unclear why Musk would be owed damages based on a deal that was never struck, OpenAI argues.

It’s also unclear why Musk’s stake in xAI is relevant, since OpenAI is a completely different company not bound to match xAI’s offerings. Wazzan allegedly wasn’t even given access to xAI’s actual numbers to help him with his estimate, only referring to public reporting estimating that Musk owns 53 percent of xAI’s equity. OpenAI accused Wazzan of including the xAI numbers to inflate the total damages to please Musk.

“By all appearances, what Wazzan has done is cherry-pick convenient factors that correspond roughly to the size of the ‘economic interest’ Musk wants to claim, and declare that those factors support Musk’s claim,” OpenAI’s filing said.

Further frustrating OpenAI and Microsoft, Wazzan opined that Musk and xAI should receive the exact same total damages whether they succeed on just one or all of the four claims raised in the lawsuit.

OpenAI and Microsoft are hoping the court will agree that Wazzan’s math is an “unreliable… black box” and exclude his opinions as improperly reliant on calculations that cannot be independently tested.

Microsoft could not be reached for comment, but OpenAI has alleged that Musk’s suit is a harassment campaign aimed at stalling a competitor so that his rival AI firm, xAI, can catch up.

“Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement provided to Ars. “This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.”

Wazzan is “a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience who has managed his own successful venture capital firm that provided seed-level funding to technology startups,” Musk’s filing said.

OpenAI explained how Musk got connected with Wazzan, who testified that he had never been hired by any of Musk’s companies before. Instead, three months before he submitted his opinions, Wazzan said that Musk’s legal team had reached out to his consulting firm, BRG, and the call was routed to him.

Wazzan’s task was to figure out how much Musk should be owed after investing $38 million in OpenAI—roughly 60 percent of its seed funding. Musk also made nonmonetary contributions Wazzan had to weigh, like “recruiting key employees, introducing business contacts, teaching his cofounders everything he knew about running a successful startup, and lending his prestige and reputation to the venture,” Musk’s filing said.

The “fact pattern” was “pretty unique,” Wazzan testified, while admitting that his calculations weren’t something you’d find “in a textbook.”

Additionally, Wazzan had to factor in Microsoft’s alleged wrongful gains, by deducing how much of Microsoft’s profits went back into funding the nonprofit. Microsoft alleged Wazzan got this estimate wrong after assuming that “some portion of Microsoft’s stake in the OpenAI for-profit entity should flow back to the OpenAI nonprofit” and arbitrarily decided that the portion must be “equal” to “the nonprofit’s stake in the for-profit entity.” With this odd math, Wazzan double-counted value of the nonprofit and inflated Musk’s damages estimate, Microsoft alleged.

“Wazzan offers no rationale—contractual, governance, economic, or otherwise—for reallocating any portion of Microsoft’s negotiated interest to the nonprofit,” OpenAI’s and Microsoft’s filing said.

Perhaps most glaringly, Wazzan reached his opinions without ever weighing the contributions of anyone but Musk, OpenAI alleged. That means that Wazzan’s analysis did not just discount efforts of co-founders and investors like Microsoft, which “invested billions of dollars into OpenAI’s for-profit affiliate in the years after Musk quit.” It also dismissed scientists and programmers who invented ChatGPT as having “contributed zero percent of the nonprofit’s current value,” OpenAI alleged.

“I don’t need to know all the other people,” Wazzan testified.

Wazzan supposedly also did not bother to quantify Musk’s nonmonetary contributions, which could be in the thousands, millions, or billions based on his vague math, OpenAI argued.

Even Musk’s legal team seemed to contradict Wazzan, OpenAI’s filing noted. In Musk’s filing on remedies, it’s acknowledged that the jury may have to adjust the total damages. Because Wazzan does not break down damages by claims and merely assigns the same damages to each individual claim, OpenAI argued it will be impossible for a jury to adjust any of Wazzan’s black box calculations.

“Wazzan’s methodology is made up; his results unverifiable; his approach admittedly unprecedented; and his proposed outcome—the transfer of billions of dollars from a nonprofit corporation to a donor-turned competitor—implausible on its face,” OpenAI argued.

At a trial starting in April, Musk will strive to convince a court that such extraordinary damages are owed. OpenAI hopes he’ll fail, in part since “it is legally impossible for private individuals to hold economic interests in nonprofits” and “Wazzan conceded at deposition that he had no reason to believe Musk ‘expected a financial return when he donated… to OpenAI nonprofit.’”

“Allowing a jury to hear a disgorgement number—particularly one that is untethered to specific alleged wrongful conduct and results in Musk being paid amounts thousands of times greater than his actual donations—risks misleading the jury as to what relief is recoverable and renders the challenged opinions inadmissible,” OpenAI’s filing said.

Wazzan declined to comment. xAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment.</div>

            <h2>Asus confirms its smartphone business is on indefinite hiatus</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/asus-confirms-its-smartphone-business-is-on-indefinite-hiatus/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An unconfirmed report early this month suggested Asus was pulling back on its smartphone plans, but the company declined to comment at the time. Asus chairman Jonney Shih has now confirmed the wind-down of its smartphone business during an event in Taiwan. Instead, Asus will focus on AI products like robots and smart glasses.

Shih addressed the company’s future plans during a 2026 kick-off event in Taiwan, as reported by Inside. “Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future,” said Shih (machine translated).

So don’t expect a new Zenfone or ROG Phone from Asus in 2026. That said, very few phone buyers were keeping tabs on the latest Asus phones anyway, which is probably why Asus is throwing in the towel. Shih isn’t saying Asus won’t ever release a new phone, but the company will take an “indefinite wait-and-see” approach. Again, this is a translation and could be interpreted in multiple ways.

The Zenfone line might not be missed—its claim to fame was being slightly smaller and cheaper than competing devices, but Asus’ support and update policy were lightyears behind the market leaders. The ROG Phone line has been prominent in the gaming phone niche, offering the latest chipsets with active cooling, multiple USB-C ports, game controller accessories, blinking lights, and even a headphone jack. However, ROG Phones are even more expensive than Samsung’s flagship devices, with the most recent ROG Phone 9 Pro starting at $1,200. Apparently, the market of those who aren’t happy gaming on the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy is miniscule.

Existing Asus devices should continue to get updates, but Asus never took the lead there. The lavishly expensive ROG Phone 9 Pro is only guaranteed two OS updates and five years of security patches. The most recent Zenfones are also only eligible for two Android version updates, but they get just four years of security support.

Shih’s comments imply that Asus won’t get back into the phone game unless something changes, and that’s not likely. Asus is not the first OEM to drop phone plans, and this is a continuation of a trend that has been underway for years as people upgrade phones less often.

Asus used to be a major player in the Android device ecosystem, offering myriad phones, tablets, phones that turned into tablets, and tablets that turned into PCs (sort of). The rapidly expanding market and advancing technology in the late 2000s and early 2010s left room for companies like Asus to operate alongside bigger OEMs like Samsung and Apple. Those were the days when every smartphone preference was served, from keyboarded sliders, to devices with integrated projectors, to the flat slab phones that eventually won out.

Today, smartphones have become a mature technology, and there simply isn’t as much room for improvement year-to-year. Combine that with rising prices, and people are apt to keep their devices longer. The continued rise of Chinese OEMs like Vivo, Xiaomi, and Huawei also makes it more difficult for niche players—particularly those focused on markets outside the US—to earn money designing and manufacturing a new smartphone every year. And as soon as you stop doing that, other brands are faster and more well-supported when the time does come to pick up a new phone.

So far, no Android device maker that has taken a break from releasing phones has ever ramped back up. Just ask LG, which once traded blows with hometown rival Samsung in smartphones. LG’s mobile division lost money for years, leading it to scale back its release schedule in 2019. At the time, the company was adamant it would release new phones when it had a good reason. A few years later, LG’s mobile division called it quits.

The possible end of Asus phones further narrows the market, leaving phone buyers with fewer choices. That doesn’t matter to Asus, though, which is a company that exists to make money. While announcing an indefinite pause in smartphone releases, Shih also noted that the company saw a 26.1 percent increase in revenue for 2025, thanks in large part to a doubling of its AI server business. So Asus is focusing on that part of the market. Maybe that’s not the best long-term strategy, but neither is losing money on smartphones.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/reports-of-ad-supported-xbox-game-streams-show-microsofts-lack-of-imagination/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Currently, Microsoft’s long-running Cloud Gaming service is limited to players that have a Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription. Now, new reporting suggests Microsoft is planning to offer non-subscribers access to game streams paid for by advertising in the near future, but only in extremely limited circumstances.

The latest wave of rumors was set off late last week when The Verge’s Tom Warren shared an Xbox Cloud Gaming loading screen with a message mentioning “1 hour of ad supported playtime per session.” That leaked message comes after Windows Central reported last summer that Microsoft has been “exploring video ads for free games for quite some time,” à la the two-minute sponsorships that appear before free-tier game streams on Nvidia’s GeForce Now service.

Don’t get your hopes up for easy, free, ad-supported access to the entire Xbox Cloud Gaming library, though. Windows Central now reports that Microsoft will be using ads merely to slightly expand access to its “Stream your own game” program. That program currently offers subscribers to the Xbox Game Pass Essentials tier (or higher) the privilege of streaming versions of some of the Xbox games they’ve already purchased digitally. Windows Central’s unnamed sources suggest a “session-based ad-supported access tier” to stream those purchased games will be offered to non-subscribers as soon as “this year.”

That’s a moderately useful option for cloud-curious Xbox players that might not be willing to take the plunge on a monthly subscription, we suppose. But it also feels like Microsoft could come up with some more imaginative ways to use Cloud Gaming to reach occasional players in new ways.

What’s stopping Microsoft from offer streaming players a 30-minute timed demo stream of any available Xbox Cloud Gaming title—perhaps in exchange for watching a short ad, or perhaps simply as an Xbox Live Arcade-style sales juicing tactic? Or why not offer discounted access to a streaming-only Game Pass subscription for players willing to watch occasional ads, like Netflix? Microsoft could even let players spend a couple of bucks to rent a digital copy of the title for a few days, much as services like iTunes do for newer films.

Those are just a few ideas off the top of our heads. And they all feel potentially more impactful than using ads as a way to let Xbox players stream copies of games they already purchased.

Back in 2019, we noted how Stadia’s strictly buy-before-you-play streaming business model limited the appeal of what ended up as a doomed cloud-gaming experiment. Microsoft should take some lessons from Google’s failure and experiment with new ways to use streaming to reach players that might not have access to the latest high-end hardware for their gaming experiences.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is hellbent on stuffing Windows 11 with AI — and many feel that this is coming at the expense of the operating system’s usability.

That aggrieved sentiment now seems more vindicated than ever, after Microsoft rolled out a new update that prevented users from shutting down their PCs — a core functionality that there should be zero excuses for not working.

The patch, released on January 13, was the first security update of the new year, and ultimately created more issues than it fixed. As Microsoft tells it, a bug related to its System Guard Secure Launch security feature was preventing users from shutting down or hibernating their PCs, and instead caused them to get stuck in an endless shutdown loop in which they either didn’t finish the process and stayed powered on, or simply restarted. This created a potential security risk for devices left unattended, not to mention an unnecessary strain on the power bill.

To fix the issue, Miscrosoft rushed out a emergency out-of-band update this Saturday, a typically rare intervention that these days is feeling more and more common, The Verge noted in its coverage. And while the scale of the issue does not appear to be outright disastrous — as only PCs installed with an older edition of Windows 11, 23H2, and specifically the Enterprise or IoT editions, were affected — it’s nonetheless an embarrassingly glaring oversight.

“When you vibe code an OS,” joked one Redditor, mocking Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s boast that as much as 30 percent of the company’s code is now written with AI.

The buggy update comes as Microsoft is facing more and more heat for its Ahabian monomania for AI. Executives at the company have described turning Windows 11 into an “agentic OS” and even a full-blown “canvas for AI.” These changes have included stuffing Microsoft’s AI chatbot Copilot in the OS’ file explorer, and testing features like Copilot Vision and Copilot Actions, which collectively allow the AI to analyze user’s screens to perform tasks on their behalf. The company has also frequently experimented with new ways of shoving a button for Copilot into the system’s interface.

It’s not surprising, then, that earlier this month, the term “Microslop” went viral online. It was a direct response to Nadella’s plea that we should stop using the slang “slop,” the recently crowned word-of-the-year for describing the shoddy text, images, and videos mass produced by AI models.

Ironically, Microsoft’s obsession with AI also appears to be blowing back on the employees building it, as The Verge reported last week that the company was shutting down its Redmond HQ library in favor of pursuing an “AI-powered learning experience.”

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Is the AI industry racing towards a point where the tech’s progress stalls out or slows to a crawl? Many experts, including one of the field’s foundational figures, seem to think it’s possible.

“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, told The Guardian.

“And that could be a real [financial] crash,” he added. “A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”

Part of the problem is that the AI industry has hyped itself into an impossibly high-stakes situation. AI finding some niche uses in some industries is not the premise that has raked in trillions of dollars in investment; instead, the end game is creating a so-called artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical AI system that matches or surpasses human cognition. David Cahn at the powerful Silicon Valley investment firm Sequoia Capital said as much in an October blog post quoted by The Guardian: “Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade.”

Betraying the vagueness of the AGI mission, the more specific points of what constitutes AGI is hotly debated, and some tech leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have begun distancing themselves from the terminology. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, for example, favors calling it — whatever “it” is — an AI “superintelligence” instead.

Concerns over an AI “wall” or “winter” popping an AI “bubble” have been raised since the boom kicked off three years ago, and were rekindled last summer with the disappointing launch of OpenAI’s GPT-5 model, which saw only marginal benchmark gains over its predecessor, and which many fans felt was subjectively worse to talk to.

In November, some faith in the industry was restored, however, with the launch of Google’s Gemini 3 models, as well as Google’s new video generating models capable of producing stunningly lifelike footage. For the time being at least, doubts over the industry’s future were offloaded onto doubting OpenAI’s ability to lead it instead, with Google taking up the banner.

Regardless of who’s at the helm, the stakes are enormously high, as the rapid buildout of AI data centers is projected by Morgan Stanley to soar to $2.9 trillion by 2028, with Meta alone saying it will spend $600 billion on US infrastructure.

Much attention has begun to be paid to the “circular” nature of the deals being struck among major AI players, such as AI chipmaker Nvidia pledging to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, while OpenAI agrees to buy billions of dollars worth of Nvidia’s AI chips. The fear is that these deals are helping prop up a multi-trillion-dollar house of cards that could catastrophically collapse if investors get spooked by an AI wall.

In some cases, the calls are coming from inside the house. Meta’s recently ousted chief AI scientist and fellow “godfather” of AI Yann LeCun is a vocal skeptic of the large language model architecture used to power the industry’s leading chatbots, believing an entirely new form of AI “world” model, which is trained on physical data instead of just language, is the pathway to building truly advanced AIs.

But Bengio, the other AI godfather, ultimately remains optimistic about the industry’s future.

“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he told The Guardian.

On the economic side, technology analyst Benedict Evans argues, with similar optimism, that the AI spending isn’t as outrageous as it sounds when compared to other industries like oil and gas, which spend some $600 billion every year.

“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” Evans told The Guardian. “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks — and everything else our business is based on — is going to work,&#39;” Evans said. “It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”

On the other hand, oil and gas companies can justify that spending because their goods and services underpin modern society as we know it. Can AI chatbots come even close to doing the same?

            <div id="article-text">The future moguls of corporate America aren’t living like the new money princes in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” Instead, today’s aspiring tycoons are pursuing a different kind of luxury: a monastic purity through abstinence.

For Mahir Laul, founder of HR software startup Velric, the typically youthful whirlwind of sex and romance takes a backseat to Slack notifs and fundraising rounds. “There’s two things that I care about the most: the gym and my work,” Laul told Business Insider in an interview. “I am obsessed with work. My love life is in the gutters.”

With so much pressure on building the next tech unicorn, Laul says most of his fellow entrepreneurs are in the same boat — a lifestyle that doesn’t leave much room for romance, casual or otherwise.

“The opportunity cost is really high,” Annie Liao, founder of AI education company Build Club told BI. “Every night you spent out is time you could have spent building your startup.” She told the publication her San Francisco roommates are in the same boat. To the future new money of America, dating apps are a “big, big distraction,” the founder said.

Those who have paddled into the dating pool say they did so long before the days of building. Now that they’re founders, their long-standing relationships apparently come in handy in the business world.

“Being in a relationship is really helpful for building the company,” said Yang Fan Yun, cofounder of Composite, a company peddling in AI agents for web browsers. Yun told BI he met his current girlfriend early into his education at Stanford. Now that he’s in builder mode, he finds his girlfriend comes in handy by helping with things like product testing.

“You’ve always heard the mentality, ‘behind every successful man, there’s the right woman,&#39;” Laul told BI. “Rather than looking for hookups, I tend to look for someone as a life partner. But it’s been difficult.”

Avaricious chastity isn’t the only thing separating tech founders from their generational peers. The same motivations fuel a thriving sober movement, as well as a clinical relationship to food.

All in all, it’s a strange bargain for the would-be Rockefellers of the 21st century. In a calculated pursuit of wealth and status, they’ve abandoned the very pleasures that once defined life on the top rung. It raises an obvious question for those of us further down: if this is what the good life looks like, then what’s the point?

            <div id="article-text">The inventor of a controversial suicide pod is making sure his device keeps up with the times by augmenting it with AI tech — which, we regret to inform you, is not merely some sort of dark joke.

“One of the parts to the device which hadn’t been finished, but is now finished, is the artificial intelligence,” the inventor, Philip Nitschke, told the Daily Mail in a new interview.

Named the Sarco pod after the ancient sarcophagus, the euthanasia chamber, first built in 2019, has been championed by the pro-assisted dying organization The Last Resort. In 2024, it was used to facilitate the suicide of a 64-year-old woman in Switzerland. The 3D-printed pod is activated when the person seeking to take their own life presses a button, filling the sealed, futuristic-looking coffin with nitrogen that causes the user to lose consciousness and “peacefully” pass away within a few minutes.

To date, the woman’s death in Switzerland is the only case of the Sarco pod seeing real-world action. Soon after she died, Swiss authorities showed up at the sylvan cabin where the pod was located and arrested the late Florian Willet, then co-president of Last Resort, who was supervising her death, on suspicion of aiding and abetting a suicide. He was ultimately released two months later.

Assisted dying is technically legal in Switzerland, but only if the person seeking suicide is deemed to have the mental capacity to make the decision, and only if they carry out the suicide themselves, rather than a third-party.

That last bit is why the patient presses the button to activate the chamber, a workaround that stands on legally shaky ground as it is (hence Willet’s arrest). Even more contestable is determining whether the patient is capable of making their mortal decision — which, of course, is where AI enters the picture.

As Nitschke was designing a “Double Dutch” version of the Sarco pod that would allow couples to die together, he stumbled on the idea of using AI to administer a psychiatric “test” to determine their mental capacity. If they pass the AI’s judgment, it activates the “power to switch on the Sarco.”

“That part wasn’t working when we first used the device,” Nitschke told the Daily Mail, referring to the 64-year-old woman’s death.

“Traditionally, that’s done by talking to a psychiatrist for five minutes, and we did that,” he explained. “She had a rather traditional assessment of mental capacity through a Dutch psychiatrist.”

“But with the new Double Dutch, we’ll have the software incorporated,” Nitschke continued, “so you’ll have to do your little test online with an avatar, and if you pass that test, then the avatar tells you you’ve got mental capacity.”

Passing the test will power on the Sarco for the next 24 hours, during which a person or couple can climb in and press the button to end it all. If they miss the day-long window, they’ll have to take the AI-administered test all over again.

How this will actually work in practice is as questionable as the promises of AI itself. AI models are prone to hallucinating, are alarmingly sycophantic, and have frequently failed when deployed in medical scenarios. Entrusting the tech to give the go-ahead to someone killing themselves — especially as AI chatbots are under the microscope for seemingly encouraging many adults and teenagers to take their own lives in cases of so-called AI psychosis — sounds like an ethical disaster waiting to happen.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA’s Moon rocket has made it to its launchpad.

On Saturday, the towering assembly — comprising the enormous Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and a new Orion spacecraft — rode atop a behemoth moving platform called a crawler-transporter, inching its way at around one mile per hour from its Vehicle Assembly Building on one side of the Kennedy Space Center to its launchpad over four miles away. The trek lasted until nightfall, a small test of patience for what is a lunar mission years in the making: Artemis II.

“This is the start of a very long journey,” said Jared Isaacman, NASA’s new administrator, told reporters at the scene of the rocket’s launchpad journey, as quoted by The New York Times.

When — or if — the rocket launches, the ten-day Artemis II mission will see a crew of four astronauts visit the Moon for the first time in more than half a century. Or at least its orbital real estate: the astronauts won’t land on the lunar surface yet — that part comes in the following mission, Artemis III — but will instead closely fly around the rocky body before returning to Earth, a stunning achievement in its own right. One of the mission’s key objectives will be to test the spacecraft’s life support system, paving the way for an actual touchdown.

Still, there’s quite a bit of elbow grease ahead before NASA is even willing to announce a hard launch date. Now that the rocket’s on the pad, engineers will conduct what’s known as a wet dress rehearsal, loading its propellant tanks with over 700,000 gallons of super-chilled liquid propellant and running through a mock launch countdown, stopping short of actually igniting the SLS’s RS-25 engines. Afterwards, all of the propellant will be drained from the rocket, and from there, NASA will assess how the spacecraft performed. (It’s worth mentioning here that the previous Artemis I mission, the uncrewed dry-run for Artemis II, was delayed by the discovery of a leaky propellant seal.)

The earliest launch window is between February 6 and February 11. If that window is missed, then the next one to open up will be in March.

The commander of the mission is NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman, who will be joined by his colleagues Victor Glover and Christina Koch, as well as Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Glover will be the first Black man to fly by the Moon, Koch the first woman, and Hansen the first non-American, the NYT noted. Altogether, the quartet will be the first people to fly to the Moon since Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

The good feelings over Artemis II will at least temporarily subside questions over the fate of Artemis III — the mission that’s slated to see astronauts actually step on the lunar surface — which is looking dicey as there’s significant doubt over whether the spacecraft chosen to make the lunar landing, SpaceX’s Starship, will be ready in time.

            <h2>Cybertruck Sales Show Stomach-Churning Drop</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla’s “apocalypse-proof” Cybertruck is continuing to experience a near-cataclysmic plunge in sales that seems impossible to recover from.

According to a new analysis of Cox Automotive data by InsideEVs, the unorthodox electric pickup truck suffered the steepest drop in sales by volume of any EV sold in the US in 2025, capping off a disastrous year in which every quarter seemed to bring more record-setting Cybertruck lows.

For context, in 2024 — the first full year of the Cybertruck being on the market — Tesla sold around 39,000 of the notoriously unreliable pickups. That’s a figure that isn’t even in the same planet as CEO Elon Musk’s up-front boast that the automaker would sell up to half a million of these every year.

The year following, any hope that it would be a late-blooming success story went up in smoke like a wrecked EV. A pitiful tally of just 20,200 Cybertrucks were sold in all of 2025, and that shortfall of around 19,000 sales, representing a near 50 percent collapse, is the largest sales drop of an EV on sale in the US, according to InsideEV. (And that’s without getting into how Musk reportedly sold Cybertrucks to his own companies to juice sales figures, so the real picture may be even worse.)

To be fair to the Cybertruck, its first year of sales had some pretty good numbers for what remains a fairly niche market of electric pickups, regardless of the fact that it was still drastically short of Musk’s typically overly-optimistic projections — so it had a higher bar to fall from than most.

Still, the cratering sales didn’t come out of nowhere. Earning a reputation for being unreliable rustbuckets, the Cybertruck has been recalled ten times for issues as serious and embarrassing as its accelerator pedal getting stuck in the down position and losing power while driving. Add to that the recalls for its stainless steel body panels flying off because they were held on with crummy glue — and another glue recall for its lightbar attachments, too — and it becomes unclear whether the trucks which Musk frequently hyped as capable of surviving the post-apocalypse would even be a reliable pick to survive a trip to the Tesla Diner.

It also certainly didn’t help that Musk spent all of last year speed-running becoming one of the most hated men in America with his espousal of far-right politics and his hands-on role in gutting the federal government through his pet project DOGE, tanking Tesla’s reputation with it. And out of all the EV automaker’s cars, the Cybertruck is the one most closely associated with Musk’s personal brand and vision.

Perhaps Musk’s pride in the Cybertruck is why it hasn’t landed on the chopping block yet. As Electrek noted, Ford’s EV pickup, the F-150 Lightning, comfortably outsold the Cybertruck last year — and it got canned for not selling enough.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In an effort to sweeten the pot for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shareholders, Netflix is now offering cash for shares of the company, revising the cash-and-stock deal it had struck with WBD’s board earlier.

However, the streaming giant is still offering the same $27.75 the companies had agreed on for WBD’s movie studio and streaming assets, and the deal continues to value the company at $82.7 billion.

The new offer serves to simplify the deal structure, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday, “provides greater certainty of value,” and speeds up the timeline for a shareholder vote. Netflix said it would finance the deal with cash, debt, and “committed financing.”

The change-up comes as rival suitor Paramount Skydance has intensified efforts to win over WBD’s shareholders with its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for the entirety of the company, including getting a $40 billion guarantee from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.

Paramount last week also sued WBD for more information on Netflix’s offer and said it would nominate new members to Warner Bros.’ board, after WBD rebuffed its offer. The company also sought to expedite the lawsuit, but the court rejected that effort.

Netflix, for its part, had until now stuck to its original cash-and-share offer, enjoying the full backing of WBD’s board, which has resolutely rejected Paramount’s bids. WBD has argued that selling to Netflix would make for a better deal because the streaming giant has the capital to pay, and has said that Paramount’s deal poses “materially more risk,” as it would saddle the combined company with $87 billion in debt.

Warner Bros. has also called into question Paramount’s ability to function after the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating, and has raised concerns about Paramount’s negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by the acquisition.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a sign of the demand, or hype, for AI startups, Emergent, an Indian startup building an AI “vibe-coding” platform, has raised $70 million less than four months after it raised a $23 million Series A.

The Series B round was jointly led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 and Khosla Ventures, and values the startup at $300 million post-money, sources with knowledge of the deal told TechCrunch.

Prosus, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Together, and Y Combinator also participated. Emergent has now raised $100 million within seven months of its launch.

The funding comes as Emergent claims $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and more than 5 million users across 190-plus countries. The startup said it is targeting ARR of more than $100 million by April 2026.

Like other vibe-coding platforms, Emergent uses AI agents to help users design, build, test and deploy full-stack web and mobile apps. It targets entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to ship products without having to hire large engineering teams.

“We continue to see massive demand across our top geographies — the U.S., Europe and India — and we’ll continue to expand deeper into these markets,” founder Mukund Jha told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s recently launched mobile app-building service is seeing strong adoption.

Emergent says it is headquartered in San Francisco, but 70 of its 75 employees work out of an office in Bengaluru. The startup is hiring aggressively across functions in both countries, Jha said.

Emergent competes with the likes of Lovable, Cursor and Replit, all of which have mushroomed into huge businesses within a couple of years of launch as AI-assisted coding enables users to develop their own apps without requiring much in the way of actual programming knowledge or skills.

To its credit, Emergent seems to have successfully tapped investor interest in such vibe-coding platforms to fund itself. Accel also backed Rocket, another India-founded startup, in a $15 million seed round last year, along with Together Fund and Salesforce Ventures.

The deal is also notable as it marks SoftBank’s return to investing in India — the firm previously backed Indian commerce startup ElasticRun nearly four years ago.

Emergent says the fresh funding will be used to expand its team, accelerate product development, and deepen its presence in key markets.

            <h2>Meta’s Oversight Board takes up permanent bans in landmark case</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/metas-oversight-board-is-taking-on-its-first-case-focused-the-companys-ability-to-disable-accounts/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta’s Oversight Board is tackling a case focused on Meta’s ability to permanently disable user accounts. Permanent bans are a drastic action, locking people out of their profiles, memories, friend connections, and, in the case of creators and businesses, their ability to market and communicate with fans and customers.

This is the first time in the organization’s five-year history as an oversight body that permanent account bans have been a subject of the Oversight Board’s focus, the organization notes.

The case being reviewed isn’t exactly one of an everyday user. Instead, the case involves a high-profile Instagram user who repeatedly violated Meta’s Community Standards by posting visual threats of violence against a female journalist, anti-gay slurs against politicians, content depicting a sex act, allegations of misconduct against minorities, and more. The account had not accumulated enough strikes to be automatically disabled, but Meta made the decision to permanently ban the account.

The Board’s materials didn’t name the account in question, but its recommendations could impact others who post content that targets public figures with abuse, harassment, and threats, as well as users who have their accounts permanently banned without receiving transparent explanations.

Meta referred this specific case to the Board, which included five posts made in the year before the account was permanently disabled. The Board says it’s looking for input about several key issues: how permanent bans can be processed fairly, the effectiveness of its current tools to protect public figures and journalists from repeated abuse and threats of violence, the challenges of identifying off-platform content, whether punitive measures effectively shape online behaviors, and best practices for transparent reporting on account enforcement decisions.

The decision to review the particulars of the case comes after a year in which users have complained of mass bans with little information about what they did wrong. The issue has impacted Facebook Groups, as well as individual account holders who believe that automated moderation tools are to blame. In addition, those who have been banned have complained that Meta’s paid support offering, Meta Verified, has proven useless to aid them in these situations.

Whether the Oversight Board has any real sway to address issues on Meta’s platform continues to be debated, of course.

The board has a limited scope to enact change at the social networking giant, meaning it can’t force Meta to make broader policy changes or address systemic issues. Notably, the Board isn’t consulted when CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to make sweeping changes to the company’s policies — like its decision last year to relax hate speech restrictions. The Board can make recommendations and can overturn specific content moderation decisions, but it can often be slow to render a decision. It also takes on relatively few cases compared to the millions of moderation decisions that Meta makes across its user base.

According to a report released in December, Meta has implemented 75% of more than 300 recommendations the Board has issued, and its content moderation decisions have been consistently followed by Meta. Meta also recently asked for the policy advisors’ opinion on its implementation of the crowdsourced fact-checking feature, Community Notes.

After the Oversight Board issues its policy recommendations to Meta, the company has 60 days to respond. The Board is also soliciting public comments on this topic.

Correction: The public comments can be submitted anonymously; this post was updated after publication to reflect this.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/everstone-combines-wingify-ab-tasty-for-100m-digital-experience-optimization-platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Private equity firm Everstone Capital is bringing together India’s Wingify — a company that helps businesses test different versions of their websites to improve sales and customer engagement — and France’s AB Tasty to build an over $100 million a digital experience optimization company with more than $100 million in annual revenue, just a year after it bought a controlling stake in Wingify for $200 million.

The combined business will serve more than 4,000 customers globally and generate more than $100 million in annual revenue, with about 90% coming from the U.S. and Europe and teams spanning North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, the companies said on Tuesday. Wingify co-founder Sparsh Gupta will lead the merged entity as CEO, while Everstone will remain the largest institutional shareholder.

The deal comes as digital experience tools, including those for A/B testing and personalization, are increasingly consolidating, as enterprises look to deploy AI across marketing, product and growth teams without stitching together multiple vendors. The merged company will invest more heavily in AI-led capabilities over time, while keeping customer experience unchanged in the near term and expanding the depth of its platform gradually, Gupta said in an interview.

Everstone is injecting significant additional capital as part of the transaction, Gupta told TechCrunch, describing it as primarily aimed at “cleaning up” AB Tasty’s cap table and enabling the two businesses to come together under one platform. Financial terms were not disclosed, though Gupta indicated the deal includes a cash component alongside some equity rollover for existing leadership, allowing them to maintain ownership stakes in the new entity.

Gupta framed the tie-up as a natural convergence between two long-time rivals. “Both the businesses have been operating as friendly competition,” he said, adding that the merger reflects growing demand from enterprises for more integrated, holistic digital experience platforms.

The combined entity will be led by an executive team drawn from both organizations. Alongside Gupta as CEO, Wingify co-founder Ankit Jain will serve as Chief Product and Technology Officer, while AB Tasty’s co-founders will take on senior roles: Rémi Aubert will become Chief Customer and Strategy Officer and Alix de Sagazan will serve as Chief Revenue Officer, the companies said.

Both Wingify and AB Tasty are profitable, Gupta said, and the merger is focused on building out the combined platform rather than cost-cutting. “There’s no layoffs that are planned as part of this merger,” he added, describing the rationale as “value creation at this point in time.”

The combined company will have close to 800 employees across 11 offices globally, with roughly 350 staff based outside India, Gupta said, adding that the merged entity will be headquartered in New Delhi.

Co-founded in 2010 by Paras Chopra and Gupta, Wingify remained bootstrapped for more than a decade, with VWO becoming its flagship product, helping businesses improve online conversion rates through A/B testing and customer experience optimization. Everstone acquired a majority stake in the startup in January 2025, which also marked a significant exit for Chopra, as TechCrunch reported earlier. That deal set the stage for Everstone’s platform-building strategy that has now led to the AB Tasty combination.

Wingify counts more than 3,000 brands as customers, including Forbes, Walt Disney, Amway, Hilton Vacations, TAP Portugal, and Cigna, across sectors such as e-commerce, SaaS, travel and media.

Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Paris, AB Tasty provides experimentation and personalization software used by more than 1,000 brands, including L’Oréal and Samsonite.

The combined company will compete in the same category as players such as Optimizely and Adobe, giving Singapore-headquartered Everstone and Wingify a larger footprint in Europe while deepening the merged platform’s product suite across testing, feature delivery, and AI-led personalization, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.

The deal adds to a growing wave of consolidation in marketing and product software, as private equity firms and strategic buyers look to assemble scaled, AI-ready platforms serving global enterprise customers. A recent PitchBook report shows enterprise SaaS M&A surged to 270 deals in Q3 worth $65 billion, with deal volumes up 26.2% quarter-over-quarter, and private equity accounting for 66.7% of deals. More broadly, PwC last year flagged [PDF] consolidation as a key value-creation strategy for private equity firms, and EY highlighted sustained private equity-led momentum in tech M&A in 2024 as buyers pursue platform scale and AI capabilities.

Gupta told TechCrunch that Everstone will retain majority control of the combined business and hold majority board rights following the transaction. The board will have five to six seats in total, including representation from Everstone and Gupta, alongside three to four independent directors, he added.

Everstone said it will back the combined company with additional support, including an advisory board of industry experts and operators. “Together, VWO and AB Tasty will have among the most comprehensive product offerings in the category,” said Sandeep Singh, managing director at Everstone Capital.

            <div id="article-text">The AI industry entered 2025 with strong momentum.

There were 49 startups that raised funding rounds worth $100 million or more in 2024, per our count at TechCrunch; three companies raised more than one “mega-round,” and seven companies raised rounds that were $1 billion in size or larger.

The industry didn’t slow down in 2025. While less companies raised rounds larger than $1 billion, four — Anthropic raised two rounds over $1 billion — significantly more companies raised multiple rounds compared to 2024, eight.

How will 2026 compare? Elon Musk’s xAI announced a $20 billion Series E round and Sam Altman’s brain computer interface startup Merge Labs raised a $250 million seed round (with OpenAI as the lead investor) in the first few weeks of 2026, so signs point to another strong year. Of course, it’s still early; we’ll be watching to see if the momentum continues.

Here are all the U.S. AI companies that raised $100 million last year:

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.

As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.

In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.

Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.

Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.

According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.

And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.

The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.

Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.

In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.

Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.

That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.

Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.

Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.

“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”

He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.

Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.

Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.

From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.

For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)

But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.

Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.

As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.

In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.

At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.

These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”

Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)

Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.

With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)

With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.

Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sparklers sizzled, boom-badoom-boom bass thumped, and Nicki Minaj emerged onstage at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest last month to deliver the latest plot twist in an exhausting year for politics and pop culture. The rapper—whose straight black hair reached the hem of her sleek minidress—sat down with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, who sported medieval-princess blond braids and waves. Then Minaj tore into previous presidential administrations for being un-Christian and uncool. “We can’t let people like that be in power, you guys,” she said, flaring her eyes like she does in the video for her song “Stupid Hoe.”

Minaj arrived in America at age 5 as an undocumented immigrant from Trinidad, and is still not, she said in 2024, an American citizen. Her music uses pornographic profanity to assert herself as a man-eating empress, and her fans—many of them queer—don pink wigs and call themselves “Barbz,” after Barbie. Yet here she was at a conference co-founded by Charlie Kirk, a defender of traditional gender roles who just last year called Minaj a poor role model for young Black women. Here she was, praising Donald Trump as the handsome redeemer of American pride.

Ever since the president danced with the Village People during last year’s inauguration weekend, the Trumpian right has been disorienting America with this kind of spectacle. Trolling and tackiness, often crossbred with left-coded pop songs and hot memes, have served to wish a new zeitgeist into existence. Consume only the output of MAGA’s multi-front media efforts, and you may come to feel that the country is coalescing into pep-rally unity on Trump’s behalf. Minaj’s appearance at the Turning Point event gave the right a trophy to flaunt, signaling who the popular kids really are.

Any follower of Minaj’s knows what’s behind this kind of bravado. Like the killer doll Chucky, which she often references, or perhaps like Elon Musk wielding a chainsaw, her persona—big grin, nasty words—conveys cheerful cruelty. But it’s a performance of embattlement, not dominance—the offensive defense of someone everyone thinks of as “the bad guy,” per her song “Chun-Li.” She constantly seems beset by haters, rivals, and (in recent years) a public that doesn’t stream her music as much as she demands. Seeing her onstage drove home the desperation that has also defined MAGA’s imagery this past year, whether the example was ICE arrests turned into adorable anime or recruitment posters drawn in the same pastoral style as 1930s Germany. The president’s aesthetics are wackily fascist—but American culture, for now, remains peskily democratic.

Trump’s return to office was widely portrayed as christening a new definition of chic. Young voters and voters of color had swung in his direction, thanks partly to the influence of podcasts, livestreams, and other media formats that now compete with traditional news outlets and cultural institutions. The attendance of tech barons, comedians, and content creators at Trump’s inauguration indicated that the so-called alternative media was now the mainstream—and openly pro-Trump. Its touchstones appeared to be recently booming phenomena including country music, TikTok tradwives, and mixed martial arts.

Trump quickly began consolidating his cultural power by focusing on the old media that hadn’t fallen in line. He strong-armed news networks, intervened in Hollywood mergers, overtook and renamed the Kennedy Center, slashed public-broadcasting budgets, and recast the White House press corp. These efforts have borne results: sycophantic press conferences, DEI rollbacks at movie studios, a news chief at CBS whose nightly broadcast has delivered a “salute” to Marco Rubio and spent a mere 16 seconds covering the fifth anniversary of January 6.

These authoritarian-scented measures, combined with MAGA’s apparent command of new media, gestured at what Trump really needed to achieve his full agenda: cultural pacification and control. His policies are, however else you describe them, disruptive. Mass deporting migrants, brazenly axing federal grants and jobs, pursuing an inflationary trade war, risking the lives of soldiers to trouble the sovereignty of hemispheric neighbors—these things are shaking the everyday lives of Americans. Seeking a third term, as he has hinted at doing, would redefine the presidency itself. Such drastic measures should mean, in a free and open democracy, powerful pushback vented not only through the political process but also through artists and audiences.

Outcry has, indeed, resulted—though less of it, and less sharply rendered, than one might expect. Trump’s first term spurred the indefatigable and angry Resistance, with its mocking “tiny hands” imagery and battalion of celebrities. This time, the popular protest movement is “No Kings,” which has made a point of presenting itself as a vague and upbeat pro-democracy effort. Once-outspoken entertainers have been a bit quieter of late as well. The actor Jennifer Lawrence told The New York Times that the past decade has discouraged her from using her platform for politics.

The animated pushback to ICE in Minneapolis over recent weeks marks a return to a more confrontational style of protest. But the situation in that city has also demonstrated MAGA’s methods for stigmatizing dissent. The death of the activist Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an immigration agent has been justified on the right in a fashionable tone of detachment. The right-wing pundit Erick Erickson labeling Good an “AWFUL”—an Affluent White Female Urban Liberal—stereotypes the opposition as not just wrongheaded but cringe, so cringe it doesn’t matter at all.

Yet, in important ways, the cultural feedback loop remains intact and significant. Take the Jimmy Kimmel incident. In September, the talk-show host seemed to imply, incorrectly, that Kirk’s killer was a MAGA supporter. The Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, threatened ABC, Kimmel’s network, which announced his show’s indefinite removal from its time slot. The ensuing outcry from the public, including from alt-media figures such as Joe Rogan, was deafening, and Kimmel quickly returned to the air. One lesson from that episode: Whatever motives underlay ABC’s initial decision, they were not powerful enough to justify the mess it caused.

Another lesson is that the same ecosystem that helped elect Trump is also independent from him. Rogan, the superstar podcaster credited with helping sway the 2024 election, has not only griped about Kimmel; he’s also questioned the White House’s immigration crackdown and tariffs. Andrew Schulz, another popular comedian and podcaster, declared that Trump’s foreign policy and spending bills are “the exact opposite of everything I voted for.” The streamer Adin Ross, who gave Trump a car during the 2024 campaign, now says he regrets ever talking politics, because it’s had the effect of tarnishing his brand.

Read: Is this the worst-ever era of American pop culture?

None of these figures has exactly gone blue, but their griping is in line with what polls have shown about Trump’s softening support among young people, men, and people of color. His appeal to those groups in 2024, it seems, was rooted in something other than stereotypical MAGA loyalty. The “freethinking” moniker that Rogan and others give themselves can seem risible—they’re so freethinking that they’re willing to entertain conspiracy theories and superstition—but it does, in fact, have some basis in truth.

And though the government can threaten the licenses of news networks, the internet is more difficult to tame. To be sure, Musk’s overhaul of X to make it friendlier to white nationalists, Mark Zuckerberg’s rollback of Meta’s moderation regime, and TikTok’s Trump-assisted sale to a group of investors led by the conservative billionaire Larry Ellison all suggest the extent to which web culture can be shaped and distorted by its platforms. But a podcaster is still just someone with a mic and an audience. Short of outright criminalizing dissent or resorting to mafioso intimidation—neither out of the question—Trump has no simple recourse against the online crowd other than the one he has always had, the one that politicians in a democracy are supposed to use: persuasion.

One person who understood persuasion was Charlie Kirk, whose killing might be the most culturally consequential development of the past year. Kirk grasped how the internet has changed America, but his death has demonstrated—and, disturbingly, may have resulted from—the fundamentally anarchic nature of those changes.

Kirk rose to prominence by bridging the roles of activist, influencer, and party spokesman in a manner that connected with young people and shaped consensus on the right. In early 2025, he helped diminish GOP opposition to RFK Jr.’s confirmation as health secretary by vowing to organize primary challengers. He later downplayed the delayed release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by saying he held “trust” in his “friends in the government to do what needs to be done”—a position that only someone who’d himself accrued enormous trust from his followers could possibly maintain.

After Kirk’s death, all sorts of narratives started to break down. For example, his alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, is a highly online young, white, male video gamer—which is to say, he is the kind of person who was thought to be driving America’s conservative wave. But according to evidence cited by police, he saw Kirk as a font of “hate.” Immediately after the shooting, he logged on to the social network Discord to chat with his friends, suggesting that he was performing for the sort of micro-audience upon which the nation’s fragmented culture is now built. (Robinson has not yet entered a plea of guilt or innocence.)

Kirk’s allies quickly tried to tell a new story—one of Kirk as sacred martyr. When others questioned that portrayal by citing Kirk’s more callous stances—on immigrants, guns, and trans people—Trump saw an opportunity to further pursue his anti-dissent agenda. His administration began labeling liberal advocacy groups as terrorists. J. D. Vance encouraged the punishment of anyone seen celebrating Kirk’s death. At least 600 people were subsequently fired from their jobs for social-media posts and public statements, some of which extolled the murder and some of which just quoted the victim’s own words.

But months later, the campaign to sanctify Kirk appears to have backfired in some ways. Gen Z and Gen Alpha’s highly ironic meme ecosystem has embraced what’s called “Kirkification”: the use of AI to meld Kirk’s face with all sorts of characters—superheroes, rappers, porn actors. The intentions of the Kirkifiers vary wildly. Some meme makers are admirers of Kirk who want to valorize him; some are neo-Nazis out to mock Kirk for not being extreme enough (while also drawing attention to their cause); some are liberals trying to troll conservatives; many are surely apolitical types having a nonsensical laugh. In most cases, the effect is to flout any top-down insistence on reverence, a party line, or a unified myth.

The assassination of Trump’s best mouthpiece also destabilized the online right. With Kirk gone, doubts and disagreements about Israel, tariffs, and—the big one—Epstein have spun out in a variety of directions. They’ve been stoked by a class of influencer pundits, such as Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes, who are angling to fill the cultural vacuum left by Kirk. But unlike him, they profess no particular fealty to a party establishment. They are moving by the logic of online entertainment, which, at this moment, is driven by demand for conspiracy theories and conflict—in opposition, at times, to MAGA itself.

Meanwhile, traditional opposition has been enduring a demoralization campaign via federally funded trolling. Stunts such as taking over the Kennedy Center and snarkily relabeling presidential portraits should be understood partly as efforts to exhaust opponents while letting supporters feel like they’re in on a joke. The maxims “Don’t feed the trolls” and “Don’t take the bait” can seem like enlightened responses—but in effect, they serve Trump’s need for cultural pacification.

Perhaps this is why the administration has taken the bizarre step of actively seeking confrontations with celebrities. Government-run social-media accounts have been posting political “fancams”—highlight reels that stans make to celebrate their obsessions—set to music and sounds by popular entertainers. One video pairs photos of Trump with the swooning sound of a Taylor Swift song; another mashes up a video snippet of the comedian Theo Von and shots of immigrants getting deported.

These clips work on the level of propaganda by portraying Trump’s agenda as swashbuckling and hip. But they also create ultimatums for entertainers. Should stars who object to the use of their work publicly complain—as did Von, a Trump-friendly podcaster who nevertheless didn’t like being associated with the immigration crackdowns? Or should they stay above the fray—as has Swift, a onetime Trump critic whose silence on politics over the past year has unnerved some of her fans? Or should they go meta—as did the singer SZA, who wrote on X that the administration was “rage baiting artists for free promo”?

Complaining certainly seems like a headache. In December, in another video, Sabrina Carpenter’s puppy-love anthem “Juno” was paired with deportation imagery. In response, the singer posted, “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.” The White House then shot back a statement that referenced her lyrics, asking whether she was “stupid” or “slow.” When Variety asked the government about its use of Swift’s music, a spokesperson said, “We made this video because we knew fake-news media brands like Variety would breathlessly amplify them. Congrats, you got played.”

Obnoxiousness like that is probably best understood as an attempt at reverse psychology. The administration’s fancam videos generate millions of views, and many attempts to not “amplify” Trump have only proved counterproductive. To a casual internet scroller, seeing these videos circulate without controversy might imply acquiescence from the performers featured in them. And acquiescence can be contagious. In other words, the administration may be systematically testing cultural figures out of the understanding that they still hold sway. They can still speak out, and it still matters if they do, or if they don’t. So they probably should.

As for Minaj, she’s an example of what MAGA leaders likely dream of gaining from their trolling efforts: support. The rapper began her open flirtation with the right in November by reposting an official White House video that used one of her songs. After she publicly expressed concern about reports of persecution of Christians in Nigeria, the administration brought her to address a United Nations panel on the topic. Soon she was writing on X that Trump and Vance were “the good guys,” and she started feuding with Gavin Newsom.

During Trump’s first administration, Minaj expressed horror at his immigration policies. Theories now abound as to what changed since she said, in 2020, that she’s “not gonna jump on the Donald Trump bandwagon.” One common explanation is that she’s shopping for a pardon for her husband, who was convicted of attempted rape in 1995. Others point out that she has alienated much of the music industry by feuding with liberal stars including Jay-Z, Cardi B, and Megan Thee Stallion. Jay-Z is the head of the team that programs the Super Bowl halftime show; might Minaj want to headline Turning Point USA’s alternative halftime show?

But maybe her conversion is genuine. As she talked onstage with Erika Kirk, Minaj’s voice ached while she described her own journey with Christianity. She was raised as a devout churchgoer, lapsed in her faith as she rose to stardom, and now wants to come back into the fold. I thought of Little Richard, Prince, Ye, and other colorful, crass pop predecessors of Minaj’s who were shaped by the church in early life and turned to conservative Christianity in midlife. Maybe Minaj is undergoing a very normal journey for someone like her—simply at an abnormal time in American history.

When I opened up social media after her Turning Point appearance, my feeds were full of Barbz renouncing their membership in what had been the most loyal and fervent of all pop fandoms. I saw Minaj sparring with critics and critics sparring with one another. I had the strange thought that Minaj and the dustup around her is an example of the speech rights that have survived the past year—and I felt grateful for all of the competing forces and factions that remain too complex for politics to control.</div>

            <div id="article-text">A year into Donald Trump’s second presidential term, it’s easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of activity. Whether you think his administration has achieved great things or worry that it has unleashed terrible abuses, Trump sure looks to have done a lot.

But if you view the year through the lens of the president’s powers, all of that action comes to seem more circumscribed. By neglecting some of the most significant formal and informal tools at his disposal, Trump has largely failed to advance durable policy change, at least on domestic matters. He has dominated a lot of news cycles, but at the expense of shaping the future—for good or ill.

The American presidency is a framework of duties and powers. The president is formally required to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” for instance. He is also empowered and expected to propose measures to Congress and promote a legislative agenda. He is the driving force behind the nation’s foreign and defense policy. And we have come to expect the chief executive to promote his priorities within the law through regulation and rule making, and to work to convince other officeholders as well as the general public of the appeal of his preferred courses of action.

In the first year of his second presidency, Trump seemed determined to avoid doing much of this work, and to instead use the weight and leverage of the executive branch as a cudgel to batter opponents and drive changes in their behavior. He has worked around the formal powers of the presidency more than through them, and his goal often seems to have been not so much to govern as to show force.

From the December 2025 issue: President for life

The appeal of this approach is easy to see, especially for those on the right who have felt mistreated by American elites for years. It has enabled Trump to extract real concessions from some hostile institutions. But it is inherently shortsighted and reactive. And it comes at an enormous cost for the integrity and reputation of the American government.

Trump signed fewer laws in this first year of his term than any other modern president, and most of these bills were narrow in scope and ambition. The only major legislation was a reconciliation bill that contained a variety of provisions but was, at its core, an extension of existing tax policy. “I guess we got the big, beautiful bill done,” Republican Representative David Joyce of Ohio told The Washington Post in December. “Other than that, I really can’t point to much that we got accomplished.”

This is not because Congress is implacably opposed to the president’s priorities. Like every newly elected president since Bill Clinton, Trump began his term with his party controlling both houses, albeit narrowly. And it’s not that Trump has tried and failed to drive a broad agenda through the House and Senate; he simply hasn’t tried. In fact, he doesn’t seem to have any major legislative aims for the remainder of his term.

Congress’s lethargy isn’t all Trump’s fault, of course. In the 21st century, legislators have chosen to make themselves supporting actors in Washington’s presidential drama. In theory, that weakness could be an opening for a president to muscle Congress into codifying parts of his agenda. But Trump has shown no interest in such work. His team seems to view Congress as a waste of time and energy.

The pace of regulation has also been relatively slow so far. Executive orders have been plentiful, of course, but those are often just messaging tools. Only more formal rule making can really transform the administrative state, even if the goal is to roll it back. The Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University has found that, as of the fall, the Trump administration had advanced fewer economically significant rules than the Clinton, Bush, Obama, or Biden administrations had by that point in their terms. (Regulation in Trump’s first term was similarly slow at the start.) The administration has pursued some meaningful regulatory measures, in the energy sector and banking, for instance, and the pace of rule making will surely increase. But overall, regulatory action is off to a slow start.

The White House has also shown remarkably little interest in public persuasion. Trump prides himself on being available to reporters, which is important. But what he says in press conferences and public remarks generally amounts to vague sloganeering and disjointed boasting. He has not laid out a detailed case for his policies, or clearly described his thinking on most public issues. What are the administration’s objectives and expectations in Venezuela, say? What are the president’s domestic-policy priorities for the coming year? Who knows?

If the president is not doing much of the core work of the office, what is he doing instead? Trump has deployed two primary alternative strategies for executive action, both of which have aimed to use the presidency more for leverage and reprisal than for governance. We might think of these as a West Coast business strategy and an East Coast business strategy. The first pursued a tech-focused corporate restructuring of government. And the second has sought to replace policy making with dealmaking.

The West Coast strategy was embodied by DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which transfixed Washington over the first six months of the administration. DOGE was an expression of a Silicon Valley view of executive authority, in which the purpose of an enterprise and its staff is to act rapidly and with maximum efficiency in response to iterative CEO decisions, rather than informing an executive’s choices and then steadily and accountably carrying them out.

Applied to government, the DOGE ethos amounted to blasting through chains of command and responsibility to allow for more direct presidential control of the levers of administrative action. The people attempting this struggled to understand the purpose of the distributed, competing power centers that surround the president, and wanted unmediated White House control of government information systems, which they equated with government powers and especially the flow of money. They did not see federal agencies as focal points of expertise and organization, and instead kept talking about the executive branch as just a set of buttons to push.

This experiment failed and is largely over. DOGE did not reduce federal spending in any meaningful way, because only Congress can durably cut spending. Appropriations were on a continuing resolution throughout much of 2025, which meant Biden-era spending levels remained in place, and no amount of caffeinated tweeting was going to change that. Combined with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and rising entitlement costs, this meant spending for the year was more than 3 percent higher than in 2024. Little or nothing of what DOGE did looks likely to be codified in the coming year, either.

DOGE did orchestrate some high-profile firings and buyouts, but on this front, too, real change would require Congress. There were about 270,000 fewer federal workers at the end of 2025 than at the beginning, bringing their number down to roughly the 21st-century average after a hiring spree in the Biden years. But the president firing people without replacing them or eliminating the appropriations for their roles only leaves openings for the next administration to fill. And if Trump’s successor is a Democrat, he or she will have an army of progressive activists to pick from who could easily be further to the left than the people Trump fired.

As DOGE faded from the scene about halfway through the year, the East Coast mode of governance grew more prominent. Rather than enact general rules (let alone laws) to govern sectors of society, the administration has tried to drive change by making discrete deals with individual drugmakers, energy companies, tech giants, law firms, universities, and other institutions. In return for public investments, research grants, beneficial regulatory treatment, or discretionary nonenforcement of laws, the White House has exacted all manner of commitments from these entities.

This approach appeals to Trump’s self-image as a dealmaker and to his tendency to think about political power in terms of individual news cycles. It also allows him to act with little congressional oversight or judicial review, and facilitates the shameless financial corruption and graft that have characterized this administration.

Dealmaking is most naturally at home in foreign policy and trade, and the president’s predilection for it has surely contributed to his growing focus on international affairs. But in the domestic arena, governance by dealmaking faces serious constraints. Its scale is inherently small, and the deals that get made are often treated by the institutions involved as temporary concessions made to avoid real legal change. The White House responding to the challenge of rising health costs by announcing deals with nine pharmaceutical companies in December was a good example of this approach, and its limits.

Both dealmaking and DOGE use the discretionary enforcement powers of the president—the power to withhold and confer benefits and penalties in specific cases—as leverage for affecting behavior rather than using the administrative powers of government to set predictable, uniform rules for whole sectors of society. In other words, they use capriciousness as a tool. This can be a source of real power in the short term, but it is ultimately very dangerous for American public life. Arbitrary government deforms society by making it hard for citizens and businesses to plan, invest, and build for the future, and it creates incentives for sycophantic corruption rather than entrepreneurial risk taking.

None of this means that a Trump administration that operated through more traditional modes of presidential power wouldn’t pose dangers of its own. The chief exception to these alternative strategies has been immigration policy, where the administration has deployed more of the president’s traditional tools. Trump and his team have sought and attained some legislative reforms, winning significant new funding and authority in last year’s reconciliation bill. They have pursued a great deal of focused rule making and formal regulatory and agency action. They have used the relevant bureaucracies rather than fighting them.

Needless to say, that has not prevented excesses and abuses. But whatever you think of Trump’s substantive policy goals on immigration, the fact that he has wielded the traditional powers of the presidency in pursuit of those goals has meant not only that his excesses have been more reviewable and addressable (especially by the courts) but also that his successes are more likely to endure (especially at the border).

Perhaps Trump’s most lasting influence will be opening the door for future presidents to approach the executive as he has, pursuing governing strategies rooted in capricious personalism. Still, for all the action of the past year, Trump has not been acting like a president. That has not only undermined the character of our constitutional system; it has also meant that he is getting less done than all the sound and fury might suggest.</div>

            <h2>The Attorney General Who Won’t Say No</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/03/pam-bondi-trump-doj-independence/685663/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By the time she faced her first oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Pam Bondi had become a person she never really wanted to be. She had told a reporter once that in college she’d wanted to be a pediatrician, but she ended up becoming a lawyer. She’d said that she wasn’t sure she wanted to actually practice law, but she became a prosecutor. She’d told reporters that she “never dreamed” of running for political office, but she did that too, twice winning campaigns for Florida attorney general. She’d said that when Donald Trump eventually asked her to be U.S. attorney general, she “made it really clear” that she did not want the job. During his first term, she had confided to a friend that she wanted to be ambassador to Italy.

But here she was in a Senate hearing room in October, a person who had once seemed so mild, so warm, so kindhearted that she’d earned the nickname “Pambi,” opening up a folder full of slap-downs, each tailored to a Democratic committee member, with notes on how to deliver them.

“I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump,” she told Senator Dick Durbin, who’d asked about the rationale for sending federal troops to his state.

“I cannot believe that you would accuse me of impropriety when you lied about your military service,” she said to Senator Richard Blumenthal, referring to a matter for which he had apologized 15 years earlier, while dodging his question about why the Justice Department had dropped an antitrust case after lobbying by Bondi’s former firm.

“You took money, I believe, did you, from Reid Hoffman, one of Epstein’s closest confidants,” she said to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who’d asked whether the FBI was investigating suspicious financial activities related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and who later said that Bondi had “made up nonsense.”

“If you worked for me, you would have been fired,” Bondi told Senator Adam Schiff.

And on it went for hours, a calculated performance that amounted to a giant middle finger to basic notions of decorum and accountability, leaving all sorts of questions unanswered, including a fundamental one that some of Bondi’s old friends and colleagues back home in Florida had been asking. As one of them put it to me: “I keep asking myself, What the fuck happened to Pam? ”

At this point, there is little mystery about who Pam Bondi has become. She is an attorney general who does not tell Trump no. During the first year of her tenure, Bondi has carried out the most stunning transformation of the Justice Department in modern American history, turning an autonomous agency charged with upholding the U.S. Constitution into one where the rule of law is secondary to the wishes of the president.

What this has meant so far includes firing more than 230 career attorneys and other employees and accepting the resignations of at least 6,000 more, gutting the Civil Rights Division and units that investigate public corruption, and challenging core American principles such as birthright citizenship and due process. It has meant turning the might of the department against Trump’s political enemies, a growing list that includes former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA Director John Brennan, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Senator Schiff, a man who threw a sandwich at a federal agent, an Office Depot clerk who refused to print flyers for a Charlie Kirk vigil, and reportedly Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and the partner of Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by a federal immigration officer on January 7. It has meant providing a legal justification for the extra­judicial killings of at least 123 people suspected of smuggling drugs, and for the operation to capture the Venezuelan president, an action that opens the door to a world in which the only law is power. And it has meant becoming the face of the Epstein-files scandal, a position that could ultimately be Bondi’s undoing.

Trump’s previous attorneys general were loyalists who pursued a vision of robust executive-branch authority, but they had red lines: Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, citing ethics concerns; Bill Barr refused to say that the 2020 election had been stolen. Bondi’s willingness to do what Trump wants appears to be boundless, and yet that still might not be enough for him. Trump has reportedly been complaining in recent weeks that Bondi has not been moving as fast as he’d like in pursuing cases against his political opponents.

His frustration extends to her handling of the Epstein files, a political disaster for him that could mean legal jeopardy for her. Bondi has so far failed to comply with a federal law that required the release of all the unclassified Epstein files by December 19—millions of investigative documents known to contain not only references to Trump but potentially compromising information about some of the most powerful men in the world. After promising “maximum transparency,” Bondi has released only 12,285 out of more than 2 million documents—a delay she has blamed on the volume of the files—leading even some of Trump’s supporters to abandon him and leaving Bondi under enormous pressure. Arguably, nothing less than the future of the MAGA movement and the sanctity of the U.S. Constitution depend on what the attorney general is willing to do next.

All of which raises a question: not so much what happened to Pam Bondi, but why.

Any answer would have to come from sources other than Bondi herself. A Justice Department spokesperson rejected my requests to interview Bondi. Even as the attorney general has gone on Fox News and posted selfies with MAGA-friendly media personalities, she has not given any extended interviews with mainstream news outlets since she arrived at the Justice Department, where one of her first acts was to move from the traditional corner office of the attorney general to a far larger conference room. The space is some 100 feet long, with floor-to-ceiling windows, ornate wood paneling, and murals called The Triumph of Justice and The Defeat of Justice, the latter depicting Lady Justice as a blond woman collapsed on the ground. At this point, Bondi, who is 60, has sequestered herself within the MAGA-verse.

I went looking for the person who existed before all of that, which meant going to Tampa, where Pamela Jo Bondi grew up in a middle-class suburb between Busch Gardens and I-75, now a landscape of smoke shops, chiropractors, and strip malls moldering in the sun. Temple Terrace, a golf-course development of ranch houses and mossy oaks, was not the best or the worst neighbor­hood in Tampa. Bondi came from blank-slate America.

She was the oldest of three children. Her mother, Patsy, was a teacher, and her father, Joe, was also a teacher, as well as an education professor and the mayor of Temple Terrace. His grandfather had emigrated from Sicily and was a cigar maker in Ybor City, home to Tampa’s large community of Italians, Cubans, and Spaniards. Joe Bondi was an FDR Democrat, and by all accounts a generous person and the patriarch of the family. In an article in La Gaceta, a local trilingual paper, he spoke of himself as “an underdog” who had “lived the American dream,” and said that growing up in Ybor City, he’d developed “a strong sense of togetherness—this is something I’m happy to say I’ve successfully instilled in my children.” Pam was extremely close with her father and, when he died in 2013, referred to him as “my beautiful Daddy.”

She went to the local public high school down the road, also not the best or the worst. The future attorney general had Farrah Fawcett hair, served as secretary of the student council, and lost her bid for homecoming queen. She went for three years to a college that was also down the road, the University of South Florida, where her father worked, before graduating from the University of Florida, in Gainesville, with a 3.4 GPA and a degree in criminal justice. She often said she loved children, that she wanted to have a big family.

Bondi went to law school at Stetson University, two hours north of Tampa, later telling Florida’s Business Observer, “I wasn’t certain I wanted to practice law.” Her father urged her to try the state attorney’s office in Hillsborough County, where he had connections. She said yes, joining dozens of young prosecutors who worked in the courthouse in downtown Tampa, many of whom were women. The state attorney at the time was known to have a preference for blondes, among other eccentricities; one lawyer described the environment as the “Blond Ambition Tour.” Bondi adapted to a courthouse buzzing in the ’90s with local corruption scandals and often surreal cases involving drugged-out teenagers, fallen baseball stars, the murder of a circus performer called Lobster Boy, and flamboyant defense attorneys with names like Boom-Boom Benito.

Although most prosecutors stayed for five or so years before moving into more lucrative private practice, Bondi stayed for nearly 20, rising from misdemeanors to the felony section, where she handled high-profile murder cases, among others. Her evaluations from that time describe an earnest and hardworking prosecutor who sometimes lacked confidence. On a five-point scale, she got fives on diligence and threes, fours, and a few fives on legal acumen. “While Pam is very capable with good potential, she unnecessarily becomes too intimidated by difficult, long, or important cases. She sometimes becomes intimidated by some attorneys as well,” read one evaluation. Others said “team player” and “my right hand” and “Through some demanding times, she has learned the meaning of the word ‘sacrifice.’ ”

Colleagues and others who knew Bondi then remember her as a competent, at times excellent prosecutor who was good with juries, won many convictions, and was able to convey the moral certitude necessary to seek the death penalty. A former boyfriend, Billy Howard, called her “The Paminator.” At the same time, he told me, “Pam was very well liked—that is something she worked at. She liked to be liked.” Howard said that during their time together, he was at a high point in his career and also a “big partier.” He said that Pam called his boss, saying she was worried about Howard, a moment he now credits with possibly saving his life. “A part of her was genuine and caring and concerned, and it helped me,” he said.

Many others recalled how kind she could be, how accommodating, how Pambi. One courthouse colleague remembered how a relative of a crime victim mistook Bondi for a secretary and asked her to copy some papers, which Bondi did without hesitating or correcting the woman. “She had humility,” said this person, who, like some others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity because they feared retribution. Patrick Manteiga, the publisher of La Gaceta, remembered seeing Bondi at an annual event called the Governor’s Luncheon, part of the kickoff for the state fair. She was standing next to the state attorney at the time, Mark Ober, who became one of Bondi’s most important mentors. Ober was shaking hands, while Bondi supplied him with hand sanitizer.

Besides her willing persona, what began to distinguish Bondi from the courthouse crowd were her appearances on local television. She became the spokesperson for the state attorney’s office, facing cameras during big trials, becoming friendly with reporters. Bondi was good at it, and by 2000, she was making her first appearance on the Today show, talking about a high-profile murder case she had prosecuted. She began getting booked as a talking head on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News.

Florida politics was trending Republican with Jeb Bush’s election as governor. Though no one I spoke with could recall Bondi expressing strong ideological views—if anything, she seemed fairly liberal—it was around this time that she switched her party registration from Democratic to Republican. She became friendly with Sean Hannity. Soon, Fox News was sending black cars to drive her to the studio to talk about sensational cases such as that of Terri Schiavo, the comatose Florida woman who became the center of a national political drama over whether to end life support. Producers would give Bondi a tape of her appearances afterward, or she’d tell friends to record her segments, and they would gather in a living room and rewatch them. “She’d be like, ‘Did I sound stupid the way I said that?’ ” a close friend from that time told me.

As Bondi’s local fame grew, this side of her personality grew as well, people who knew her said. She could be hyper-­defensive and hyper-­sensitive to criticism. “The overwhelming thing you have to understand about Pam is her debilitating insecurity—­she was always assuming someone was talking about her,” the close friend told me. “Then she’d overcompensate.” At the same time, Bondi was socially ambitious, excelling at the cocktail-party art of remembering details about people—asking about kids, a sick mother—while looking past them at the more powerful person she wanted to meet. People who experienced this spoke of being “Bondied.” She could be thoughtful and kind, yet she would exile friends at the first hint of disloyalty. She needed constant reassurance, and sometimes this came from dogs.

Pam Bondi loves dogs. Always had them, one after another. She got involved with dog shelters and dog rescue, and once pulled off to the side of a busy road and got out of her car to chase down a stray. Another dog she helped was a Saint Bernard named Master Tank. She adopted him from a shelter after he was lost during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, not long after her own Saint Bernard had died. The story has been told but bears repeating. Master Tank belonged to Steve and Dorreen Couture and their grandson, who was 4, recovering from the murder-suicide of his parents and losing his dog during the storm. Bondi said the dog was a “walking skeleton” and “dying from heartworms” when she adopted him. The Coutures eventually tracked down Master Tank, but instead of giving him back, Bondi hired a lawyer, who accused the Coutures of abusing the dog, which Bondi had renamed Noah. “She lied,” Dorreen told a Palm Beach Post columnist years later. “My little grandson begged her to take the dog home, and she refused. She thought she would just wear us down. That we were unstable people and would just quit.” The case was settled out of court, with Bondi securing visitation rights, but she never did visit. She got another dog.

Meanwhile, Bondi was attracting more attention, including, in 2006, that of Donald Trump, who was at the peak of his TV celebrity with The Apprentice. Bondi had been defending him on TV during his dispute with the town of Palm Beach over an enormous American flag he was flying at Mar-a-Lago. As Bondi would later tell the story, Trump called her after one such appearance. “He wanted to thank me,” she recalled in an interview with Lara Trump. “All he cared about was America.”

By 2009, Bondi had also befriended a Florida political operative named Adam Goodman. They had met on a film set where Goodman, a Republican whose specialty was television, was directing an ad for Bondi’s boss, Mark Ober. She was behind the scenes, and Goodman remembers that she kept correcting him whenever he used the word jail. “Prison,” she would say. Goodman had seen Bondi on air, and when the party needed a candidate for Florida attorney general, he thought of her. “I look at things politically, through the lens of performance,” he told me. “Both of us were into the power of performance to compel things to happen.” It helped that Bondi was familiar to voters in the largest media market in the state. If she carried Hillsborough County, she would win.

When Goodman pressed Bondi to run, she told him she had never considered it and needed time to think. He thought she might say no, but then she said yes. Goodman, who remains a Bondi ally, recalled how she “knocked it out of the park” when they filmed one of her first three-minute ads. “She loves the camera, and the camera loves her,” he said, then corrected himself. “She loves the camera because she knows the camera loves her.”

As time went on, reporters began noticing another quality Bondi had developed. Manteiga remembered calling her before he printed a critical story during the campaign. “And she gets on the phone with me, and she’s crying—‘Don’t print this article,’ ” Manteiga told me. “Crying, crying.” He hung up the phone and called a friend who worked for the St. Petersburg Times. “I said she was crying, and he said, ‘Yeah, she does that to us too.’ I called another reporter, and he said, ‘Yeah, she’s done that to me.’ ”

People who knew Bondi during her eight years as Florida’s attorney general tend to make two observations about her. On the one hand, she seemed to have no burning political passions, other than saving dogs. No one I spoke with could point to some dramatic shift in her outlook, or to any newly blossoming conservative values. Privately, she did not express any. She did not seem to hate Barack Obama, subscribe to birtherism, or rail against the Affordable Care Act. She was not worried about the legalization of gay marriage, or gay adoption, or other issues animating the GOP base at the time.

“We talked for an hour about our bunions,” one GOP political operative recalled. “She was not ideological.”

On the other hand, Bondi was willing to make herself useful to the party. She became the public face of a multistate challenge to the ACA. She began wearing a necklace with little elephants. She defended Florida’s bans on gay adoption and gay marriage, arguing in a brief that the latter would cause “significant public harm,” even though she had many gay friends back in Tampa.

This was when some of Bondi’s friends began to wonder what was happening with her. When Bondi was home and ran into people who questioned her position, she would respond with some version of “I had to do it for the party,” or an exhausted “You have no idea how politics works,” or “I was elected to enforce the laws.” When one friend pressed her further, arguing that other attorneys general were refusing to enforce laws denying gay people rights, and telling her how some of her closest friends felt personally betrayed by what she was doing, Bondi said, “You know me. I love gay people. You know my heart.” Sometimes there were tears.

As state attorney general, Bondi was widely praised for her crackdown on opioid pill mills and for her work combatting human trafficking. But more and more, her success hinged on her willingness to be a spokesperson for the party, especially on Fox News. She appeared regularly as a legal commentator on Hannity, Fox & Friends, America Reports, and The Five, where she had a three-day stint as a guest host. “She was an accomplished, well-spoken carrier of the message,” the GOP operative, who worked on Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, told me, recalling Bondi’s role as a Romney surrogate. “Pam was somebody you could put out for almost anything,” this person said. “She was somebody you could put on a Sunday show.”

Bondi’s time in office coincided with a dramatic rise in lobbying of state attorneys general. Historically, the office had been a kind of political backwater. But in the years following the 1998 multi­state settlement against tobacco companies, corporations aiming to head off similar litigation began donating to attorney-general campaigns and sponsoring lavish conferences for them at resorts in California or Hawaii. Bondi attended many of them. And many of her actions tracked closely with the wishes of corporate lobbyists and campaign donors.

The most well known of these was a decision by her office to drop a formal investigation into fraud and deceptive practices at Trump University, which came after Bondi had solicited a $25,000 donation from Trump’s foundation. (A state ethics commission later stated that the timing of the decision “may raise suspicions” but found no evidence that Bondi had been “involved with the investigation or decisions regarding Trump University.”)

Soon after taking office, Bondi also pushed out two attorneys who had been among the first in the nation to expose fraudulent practices at so-called foreclosure mills; their investigation found that law firms and lending companies were using false documents to monetize foreclosures at the height of the subprime-mortgage crisis. (A Florida inspector general found “no evidence of wrongdoing” by Bondi or her department.)

Documents obtained by The New York Times showed that after being lobbied by the firm Dickstein Shapiro, Bondi declined to prosecute a hospital-bill-collection company accused of abusive practices, an online school accused of “un­conscionable sales practices,” and online travel-reservation companies accused by Bondi’s own predecessor of improperly withholding taxes. Bondi has said that she was not unduly influenced, stating at the time that “absolutely no access to me or my staff is going to have any bearing on my efforts to protect Floridians.”

Along with the flood of corporate money to attorneys general came a sharp rise in partisanship, a trend that Bondi helped accelerate. This first became obvious at an annual conference of the National Association of Attorneys General, an event where members would elect a new president. Typically, the elections were a low-stakes formality, the title rotating regionally and, for the most part, alternating between Democrats and Republicans. But one year, Bondi threw herself into contention, mounting a mini-campaign against Jim Hood of Mississippi, a Democrat, calling GOP conferees as they sat around tables. “Are you with me?” she would ask. “It was bizarre,” a Republican attorney general from that time told me. “It was a popularity contest, like in high school. She wanted the recognition.”

Bondi lost, but the move left bitter feelings, and helped diminish the sense of trust at the national association. Bondi was eventually elected to head the Republican Attorneys General Association, where she helped lead an effort to do away with another long-standing norm, that the two parties would not fund campaigns against their incumbent colleagues. The idea was that incumbents often cooperated in a bipartisan way on complex, multistate litigation, and getting rid of them would only hinder those efforts. Bondi was part of a group that seemed to simply want more GOP wins.

“I think she did more to increase partisanship among AGs than any single AG during my tenure,” Chris Toth, an independent who led the national association, told me. “And I just don’t understand why she did that.”

Bondi’s personal life during this time was difficult. Her engagement to a wealthy ophthalmologist ended. Her father died. Some friendships became strained. In an interview during her first term, Bondi described spending 13 hours a day at the office and heading home to a rented condo in Tallahassee. She was becoming a person who said of her life, “It’s been lonely, very lonely,” and who said of her dog Luke, another Saint Bernard, “He’s my company.” Bondi would bring Luke to work. She bought him a therapeutic mattress for car trips back to Tampa.

She began bringing rescue dogs to cabinet meetings, trying to get them adopted, and posting about them on Instagram—a puppy named Baker, a shepherd mix named Zeke. “I was thrilled to introduce Rosie, the gorgeous rescue Boxer mix, at the cabinet meeting yesterday,” she posted. “Rosie is looking for a forever home.”

During this time, Bondi was becoming more entrenched in Republican circles, which for her would come to mean Trump’s circles. When she ran for reelection in 2014, Trump threw her a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. When the 2016 presidential primary arrived, Goodman, the operative who had first gotten her into politics, encouraged her to endorse Trump even though establishment Republicans were still keeping their distance. If Trump won, he told her, the endorsement could give her status in his administration.

“She calls me out of the blue, 9 a.m. one morning,” Goodman told me. “She said, ‘I’m going to pick you up in five minutes.’ ” Trump was holding a rally in Tampa that day in March. “She said, ‘We’re going to the convention center, and I’m going to endorse Trump, and I need your help on talking points.’ I’m scribbling as we go to the convention center. It was one of those high-intensity moments and, turned out, historic moments.” In her speech, Bondi spoke of her yearslong friendship with Trump; Trump spoke of their “great relationship.”

And that was how Bondi became a person standing on the stage of the Republican National Convention in Ohio. Before a cheering prime-time audience, she declared that she loved “Donald.” She pointed to someone holding a sign calling for Hillary Clinton to go to prison. Clinton had criticized Bondi over her handling of the Trump University complaints.

“ ‘Lock her up,’ ” Bondi said. “I love that.”

“Oh, Pam, why did you say that?” Chris Toth remembered saying to the television at that very moment. He was certain that she knew better.

It was around this time that Bondi’s old friends began speaking of her as someone they could no longer recognize.

“She was loved around here, just so sweet,” the courthouse colleague said. “People who knew the old Pam, we just can’t resolve it.”

“I thought, Do I really know this person? ” the close friend remembered thinking after Bondi endorsed Trump.

The person they thought they knew was venturing ever deeper into Trump’s world. Though Bondi did not get a position in his first administration, in a way, she got something better. When she finished her second term as Florida attorney general, she joined a lobbying firm called Ballard Partners, which was co-led at the time by Trump’s 2016 Florida campaign manager, Susie Wiles, who would go on to run his 2024 campaign and is now his chief of staff.

Soon Bondi was making more money than she ever had in her life. She lobbied for Qatar. She lobbied for Amazon. She lobbied for Uber. And eventually she lobbied for Trump, joining his defense team during his first impeachment trial. She helped launch a group called Women for Trump during the 2020 campaign, greeting supporters at a mall in Pennsylvania. When Trump contested the 2020 election results, Bondi was one of the first high-profile figures to amplify the lie that the race had been stolen, rushing to Philadelphia with the Trump-campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski the day after the election, where she declared before a small crowd that Trump had “won Pennsylvania” even as votes were still being counted. Bondi went on Fox News, claiming that there was “evidence of cheating” and “fake ballots,” though she never signed her name to lawsuits with those allegations, which could have gotten her disbarred.

After rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Bondi remained a willing Trump operative. In testimony before the House select committee investigating the insurrection the next year, Cassidy Hutchinson, who had been an aide to then–White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, said that Bondi was among the Trump surrogates who had called her prior to her appearances before the committee to shore up her loyalty to Trump, or, as they often put it, “the family.” Hutchinson said the message was that she would be “taken care of” if she protected Trump, and that they could “ruin her life” if she did not. Bondi, whom Hutchinson knew from their encounters at the White House, assumed a kind of caretaker role, calling and texting her with job opportunities in Trump world.

“This is Susie Wiles,” Bondi messaged her on Signal at one point, providing Wiles’s email address. “She’s my best friend. She’s super sweet. She’s going to love you.”

“Susie, Matt Schlapp and I had dinner with POTUS at Mar-a-Lago tonight,” read another Signal message, referring to Wiles and a GOP operative, Hutchinson recalled. “Call Matt next week. He has a job for you that we all think you’d be great in. You are the best. Keep up the good work. Love and miss you.” (Through the Justice Department spokesperson, Bondi declined to comment on Hutchinson’s testimony. At the time, she appeared on Fox News, calling the hearings “show trials.”)

Under pressure, Hutchinson wrestled with her conscience and ultimately broke away from Trump. Bondi appeared not to wrestle. She remained inside Trump world, which meant making at least $1 million at Ballard and nearly $3 million from shares in the Trump Media & Technology Group for consulting on the merger that created the company, according to financial disclosures covering the two years prior to her nomination as attorney general.

She would make another $520,000 in consulting fees from the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, the disclosures show, where her work in the run-up to the 2024 election forecast the kind of attorney general she was willing to be. Bondi signed on to a brief supporting absolute presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for Trump when he was being investigated for 2020-election interference. In public letters and press releases, she backed a Georgia election-board official who’d claimed authority to unilaterally delay or deny the certification of election results. In April 2024, she warned election officials to do more to ensure that noncitizens could not vote, embracing a long-debunked idea that has been used to make voting more difficult and to contest election results.

Then came the day that Trump won reelection. And the day not long after that when his first nominee for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, withdrew amid concerns that allegations of sexual mis­conduct and drug use would sink his confirmation. And the day not long after that, the one that Bondi said she never expected would come, when Trump called and asked her to be his attorney general.

At first, she said no. She said she wanted to “go back to my great life in Florida.”

Then, as she often had, Pam Bondi said yes.

As she would later tell Lara Trump, the president, “in his way, talked me into doing this.” Bondi said that she was so devoted to Trump that if he asked her to answer the phones, “I would become the best switchboard operator ever.”

In Tampa, where she had built a wall around her home in one of the city’s best neighborhoods, black SUVs began to let the neighbors know when she was in town. In Washington, D.C., Bondi was easily confirmed, despite concerns among Democrats that she’d declined to acknowledge Trump had lost the 2020 election, and that her first loyalty would be to the president instead of the law. “I need to know that you would tell the president no if you’re asked to do something that is wrong, illegal, or unconstitutional,” Dick Durbin said during her confirmation hearing. Bondi responded that she would “enforce the law fairly and even­handedly.” She said that the department “must be independent and must act independently” and that “politics will not play a part.”

After Bondi was sworn in, she moved her office into the large, ornate conference room, where Joseph Tirrell, the director of the department’s ethics office, soon met her and her then–chief of staff for their first ethics briefing. Tirrell had worked in the ethics office since 2018, and had briefed the previous AG in the traditional corner office. “I had been prepared, but it was still a bit shocking,” he told me.

Tirrell said that Bondi was courteous as he went over various regulations. She had no concerns until he began explaining restrictions around accepting gifts, specifically challenge coins, the metal medallions that are given out by the military, police departments, the FBI, and other components within the Justice Department, to signify camaraderie. Trump has displayed his own collection in the Oval Office. According to Tirrell, Bondi and her chief of staff had questions about the restrictions, and a 10-­minute conversation ensued. She wanted the coins.

“They were like, ‘We still need to dig deeper on this,’ ” Tirrell told me. “That was the only real back-and-forth we had.” (Through her spokesperson, Bondi said, “No ethics advice was ever overruled.”)

Tirrell said that in the weeks that followed the meeting, Bondi pressed to keep other gifts even after he told her she couldn’t. A box of cigars. A FIFA World Cup soccer ball. Tirrell was going back and forth with Bondi’s office about the ball when he was fired, a moment he had been half-expecting; he had recently approved pro bono legal services for then–Special Counsel Jack Smith, who investigated Trump’s role in January 6 and now is on Trump’s enemies list. Tirrell is among many employees suing the department over their dismissals, believing that they were motivated by Trump’s need for retribution rather than any wrong­doing. Bondi has said the opposite—that she is “ending the weapon­ization” of the department. (The Justice Department is attempting to get Tirrell’s case dismissed.)

Standing in the Great Hall when Trump visited the Justice Department in March 2025, she proclaimed that “we are going to fight to keep America safe again,” and called Trump the “greatest president in the history of our country.”

“We are so proud to work at the directive of Donald Trump,” she said.

By the end of her first year, Bondi had taken a litany of actions pleasing to the White House. She said yes to dropping the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, allegedly in exchange for his cooperation with Trump’s deportation plans, over objections from senior prosecutors who resigned rather than cooperate; she said yes to the firing of career prosecutors even tangentially involved with investigations concerning Trump; and she said yes to an ongoing raft of pardons, including for at least 1,500 January 6 rioters, as well as dozens of MAGA loyalists, white-collar criminals, drug dealers, and business and political allies of Trump’s. Bondi defended the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, and New Orleans. And she publicly stood by her then–­acting deputy, Emil Bove, even after he allegedly said that colleagues might have to tell a federal court, “Fuck you,” a moment described in a whistleblower complaint. (The Justice Department declined to comment on the incident, due to on­going litigation.) Bove is now a federal judge.

“That would be the Honorable Judge Emil J. Bove III to you,” Bondi said to Sheldon Whitehouse during the Senate oversight hearing in October.

Bondi kept saying yes, with one possible exception.

According to reporting by multiple outlets, Bondi had quietly raised concerns about the case against Comey, the former FBI director, after federal prosecutors in Virginia concluded that there was in­sufficient evidence to bring charges.

For a moment, it seemed that Bondi might say no.

But Trump was relentless. He forced the resignation of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. He sent a Truth Social message to “Pam,” which he accidentally posted publicly. “What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia???” he wrote, referring to Senator Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, and calling them all “guilty as hell.” “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

She called reports of her hesitation over Comey a “flat out lie.” Trump appointed a new, inexperienced prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, who moved forward with the indictment. A judge dismissed the case on the grounds that Halligan had been unlawfully appointed, but the Justice Department appealed the decision.

What the loyalty of Pam Bondi might require her to do next remains an open question, especially after her clumsy handling of the Epstein files. After Trump had suggested during his campaign that he would release the files, Bondi went on Fox News in February 2025 and said that a supposed Epstein client list was “on my desk,” implying that documents were about to be released. Then she invited pro-Trump social-media influencers to the White House and handed out thick binders branded “The Epstein Files: Phase 1,” a moment that immediately backfired because the binders contained no client list and little new information. Many of the influencers criticized the move as a publicity stunt that made a mockery of Epstein’s victims, and some called for Bondi to be fired. Then Bondi backtracked, issuing a joint statement with the FBI saying that in fact there was no client list, which only further enraged a MAGA faction that has been marinating for years in the Epstein scandal and conspiracy theories about global child-trafficking rings. And then came the bipartisan legislation that required Bondi to release the files.

Now she faces an exquisite dilemma: how to comply with the law while also somehow satisfying Trump, who has given conflicting statements about the files. He has called the whole matter a “Democrat hoax,” but eventually supported the legislation requiring the release, saying that “we have nothing to hide.” He has more recently lamented that documents released so far are destroying the reputations of people who “innocently met” Epstein. Trump is exasperated that the issue won’t go away and, according to The Wall Street Journal, has blamed Bondi for making the situation worse. Even Bondi’s friend Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, has said that the attorney general “whiffed” on the matter. When I asked the White House if I could speak with Wiles, or any allies of Bondi’s, I got no response for weeks. A spokesperson eventually emailed statements praising Bondi from Trump, Wiles, Vice President J. D. Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, all of which had already appeared in the Journal.

Will Bondi continue to delay the full release of the documents, risking contempt charges? Will she resign and take the blame for the fiasco? Is it possible that Bondi’s red line is not the prosecution of the president’s political enemies, or the killing of 123 people who may or may not have been drug smugglers, or the ransacking of the Justice Department, or the undermining of the Constitution, but the prospect of her own ruin? How far is Bondi willing to go for Trump?

With midterms coming, would she say yes to deploying federal monitors to interfere at polling stations? Yes to challenging election results?

She has new friends now, a support group of women who have also said yes to Trump, including Lara Trump and Tulsi Gabbard. “We text a lot,” Bondi told Katie Miller, a former Trump-­administration aide and the wife of White House adviser Stephen Miller, on her podcast last year. “We all support each other, and have each other’s backs.”

In Tampa, Bondi’s old friends are still trying to figure out what happened to the person they remember, but one of them, the close friend, told me that she has finally stopped trying. At this point, she knows. She has been friends with Bondi since their days at the courthouse in Tampa, and on through Bondi’s time as Florida attorney general, her decision to endorse Trump, and several years after that. She said that she loved Pam, that she had tried to understand Pam, to support her, to care about her, and maybe also to excuse her. She said that she is distressed by what she believes Bondi is doing to the rule of law in America, and distressed to have concluded why.

“She went cheap for power,” the friend decided, and now she has only one question left. “Was it worth it?”

            <h2>Trump Exhaustion Syndrome</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/trump-first-year-democracy/685658/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Among the greatest tricks Donald Trump ever pulled is convincing significant portions of the population that the slow erosion of their rights is not, actually, that big of a deal.

After all, do undocumented immigrants with purported gang tattoos truly deserve due process? Is it really so bad to urge citizens to turn on their neighbors and co-workers for saying something outrageous? And is it problematic to punish journalists for reporting facts that the government would rather keep hidden? (Yes, yes, and yes! come the emphatic cries of constitutional-law experts, civil-liberties advocates, and others who care about this sort of thing.)

A year into Trump’s second term, the emboldened president’s maximalist strategy—pushing every norm to its most elastic, and then a bit beyond, and from that new breaking point pushing yet again—conjures the boiling-frog theory, in which a frog placed in boiling water will immediately hop out, but a frog placed in cool water that is slowly heated will complacently boil to death. (And yes, I know that this amphibious metaphor for failing to notice incremental negative changes is apocryphal, but the lesson is still apt.)

Or, as the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon put it to me, the Overton window is moving so far, so quickly, that the more apt way to understand Trump’s strategy is: “Fuck the Overton window.”

Bannon continued: “He’s driving deep. Remember, our strategy—I say it every day—is maximalist, a maximalist strategy. You have to take it however deep you can take it and, quite frankly, until you meet resistance. And we haven’t met any resistance.”

“We haven’t met any resistance” is overstating the case, but it is astonishing just how far Trump has pushed the country over the past year. The list of actions Trump has taken that would have outraged even his base—in some cases, especially his base—had anyone else attempted such maneuvers is as long as it is audacious. Already, many Americans have grown accustomed to bands of National Guard troops patrolling their cities; the United States bombing other countries without congressional approval (or even notification); white-nationalist rhetoric filling government social-media feeds; federal funding disappearing from elite universities that are viewed as too “woke” and hostile to Trump’s movement; hundreds of thousands of immigrants being arrested and deported, often with extreme force; the once-independent Justice Department taking orders from the White House; conservative influencers masquerading as journalists; government data losing their reliability; museums quietly whitewashing history; and the White House being physically and symbolically demolished and rebuilt in Trump’s image.

Tellingly, the president told The New York Times this month that his powers in international affairs are checked only by himself: “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”

Since Trump’s return to power, I have had a recurring conversation—with diplomats, Democrats, and certain Republicans. They have all repeatedly told me a version of the same thing: During Trump’s first term, they believed that his election was an aberration, an out-of-character mistake that would soon be corrected—but one year into his second term, they now think that Joe Biden’s 2020 victory was the aberration, and that Trump’s reelection is not a fever dream but rather a reflection of the country at this moment.

Maybe that’s why so many Americans are shrugging as the temperature rises.

During the first Trump administration, resistance was often easy to identify. Sure, there were the hordes of women in pink pussyhats and the lawyers descending on airports as Trump announced a travel ban, but there was also the quiet resistance within the administration, the top advisers and deep-bowel bureaucrats who viewed themselves as guardrails or checks on power, and who relished that role.

Now Trump’s administration is filled with true believers who ruthlessly enact his ideas, no matter how outlandish. (Earlier this year, someone close to Trump told me that his advisers have an unofficial rule: When he asks for something twice, they make it happen, regardless of the request.) Congressional Republicans have largely done as they are told, and Democrats, who don’t control either chamber, often seem to have descended into learned helplessness.

Governors and mayors—along with world leaders, corporate executives, and tech moguls—seem to have collectively concluded that it’s often better to flatter Trump and offer small concessions than to risk his wrath and vengeance. Activists have been labeled domestic terrorists, accused of left-wing “street violence,” and threatened with “the power of law enforcement.” And even though a majority of Americans, including large swaths of Trump’s own base, disagree with some of the things he is doing, the president seems impervious to his low poll numbers and to the fact that his party is careening nervously toward the midterm elections.

As many of my colleagues have repeatedly described, the dismantling of a democracy comes slowly, then all at once; rarely does it begin with armed, jackbooted men marching in the streets. It remains unclear just how far the president is willing to go, and what his endgame is. Less than a week after Trump lost the 2020 election, I wrote that Republicans were largely allowing him to pursue his baseless claims that the election had been stolen, despite privately reconciling themselves to a Biden victory. “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” a top Republican official told me at the time. “He went golfing this weekend. It’s not like he’s plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on January 20. He’s tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he’ll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he’ll leave.” After the deadly January 6 attacks, that quote hit different, periodically resurfacing and going viral for its seeming naivete. But in the moment, when the top Republican uttered it, I will confess that the words seemed plausible to me; neither of us anticipated—could have even imagined—how Trump’s first term would end.

And how will this term end? As Trump has adopted an unapologetic strongman stance, I have been struck by just how little meaningful resistance he’s faced, from citizens and even from lawmakers who claim to find his actions appalling or terrifying. In his first term, he and his team ultimately abandoned some of their most chilling and controversial edicts—the travel ban, the family-separation policy—in the face of public backlash. And some of the other incidents that prompted outrage back then—Trump essentially firing his first chief of staff by tweet, the path of a hurricane being altered with a thick Sharpie squiggle—now seem positively quaint. Yet the level of agita generally on display now, for far bolder and more brazen norm-shattering, seems, if anything, more muted.

Trump Derangement Syndrome, in many ways, has been replaced by Trump Exhaustion Syndrome: The populace notes the latest indignity, and then returns to business as usual.

Many Americans awoke on the first Saturday of this year and were stunned to learn that, on Trump’s orders, the U.S. military had executed a predawn capture of Nicolás Maduro and spirited the Nike-sweatsuit-clad Venezuelan leader to the United States to stand trial. But they should not have been so surprised.

After all, even if seizing Maduro was not Trump’s initial goal, the president had slowly been desensitizing the country to such a possibility for months and setting Venezuela up as a dangerous enemy. The first bill Trump signed into law as the 47th president was the Laken Riley Act—in honor of a nursing student in Georgia who had been attacked and killed while jogging by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant—which mandates that undocumented immigrants who commit certain crimes inside the country face stricter punishments. (The bill felt so common sense that a dozen Senate Democrats and nearly four dozen House Democrats voted for it.) Two months later, in March, Trump creatively deployed the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, arguing that the U.S. was at war with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua—and using the long-dormant legislation to begin deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members to a notorious Salvadoran mega-prison. Then, under the continued guise of defeating these “narco-terrorists,” Trump ordered the Navy to strike suspect boats in the high seas off Venezuela. (As of last Friday, 123 people have been killed in 35 strikes in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean.)

By the time Trump seized Maduro, the capture felt less like an alarmingly broad interpretation of American might and more like the logical next step in a string of reasonable ones.

After all, a through line of Trump’s presidential campaign was the denigration and dehumanization of immigrants; he would start with an archetype that sounded genuinely scary—“They are bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists,” he said in his 2015 campaign launch—and then tacitly apply it to all immigrants, or any other group that he deemed a threat.

Journalists and liberal activists have also been targeted. After the assassination of Charlie Kirk, Vice President Vance urged people to call out their neighbors and co-workers—including by reporting them to their employer—who exercised their right to free (if abhorrent) speech by celebrating Kirk’s death. Trump also issued an executive order casting a wide range of liberal activists as potential domestic terrorists, the same label immediately placed on Renee Nicole Good, the Minnesota mother killed by a federal immigration officer this month. Trump’s attacks on the media, which once were a somewhat playful campaign gimmick, have escalated. The White House now severely limits reporter access, and the Defense Department has swapped out the Pentagon press corps in favor of a new one that regurgitates administration propaganda. Last week, the FBI raided the home of a Washington Post journalist.

After six congressional Democrats with military or national-security backgrounds released a video advising members of the military to not follow illegal orders, Trump accused them of sedition—and shared a social-media post suggesting that they be hanged for treason. The president has abandoned the idea of an independent Justice Department, chiding his attorney general—in a private message that he accidentally posted publicly—for not doing more to prosecute his political opponents and enemies. Earlier this month, the DOJ launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose biggest crime seems to be refusing to ignore economic indicators and lower interest rates just because the president says he should.

The bureaucratic and staid Powell responded in a rare video message, warning, in part: “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”

Yet for all this (and more), Trump has faced little meaningful congressional opposition, although his approval rating has declined. And in some cases, the public has largely responded with a Gallic shrug. Even after the Maduro raid, Democrats en masse led with talking-point pablum—Maduro is a bad guy (true!)—rather than emphasizing the lack of congressional authorization and the possible violation of international law (also true!). Five Republican senators did join with Democrats to advance a bill forcing Trump to seek congressional approval before taking additional military action in Venezuela. But they soon backed down.

The Overton window gets moved with little consequence, Bannon told me, and the result is a further-emboldened Trump: “You move it, and you do it, and no one complains—or MSNBC and The Atlantic complain and nobody gives a fuck—and then you do it again, and push it again.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word unprecedented has been used (dare I say) an unprecedented number of times a year into Trump’s second term—up from the previously unprecedented number of times in his first term. I asked a senior White House official whether the lack of meaningful resistance has given the president even more faith in his ability to pursue his instincts as brazenly and brashly as possible. This person reframed my question, arguing that there has been little resistance because Trump’s policies are broadly popular: “Most Americans, if you ask them, ‘Do you want a drug boat sailing to the United States blown up?’ they’d say yes.”

Part of Trump’s skill in shifting—or shattering—the Overton window is his instinctual ability to choose test cases that allow him to generate sympathy for his causes, even as he blows through boundaries and tramples on rights.

After his administration mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia—a Maryland father with a protected legal status—to a Salvadoran mega-prison, Trump and his team refused to reverse the decision, dismissing concerns of due process and highlighting Abrego Garcia’s tattoos to paint him as a dangerous gang member. (Never mind that the photos that Trump showed of the tattoos had been digitally altered.) Trump’s strikes on small vessels off the coast of Venezuela are said to be aimed at cartel bosses funneling huge loads of fentanyl into the country; in fact, fentanyl doesn’t pass through the Caribbean, the boats aren’t headed to the United States, and they’re steered by the poorest and most expendable members of narco organizations. But who’s going to bother sticking up for drug runners?

“Trump is a master at getting his enemies to defend things that are politically damaging to them,” a former senior administration official still close to the president told me. “So if you are going out and defending the principle of due process—or whatever high-minded legal and constitutional things—even if your constitutional argument is strong, you are still effectively defending a narco-terrorist.”

This person continued, admiringly: “It’s interesting, the issues he picks. Even if his enemies have a legitimate beef—constitutional, legal, whatever—it still puts them in a position where they appear to be defending bad people.”

Daniel Ziblatt, a co-author of How Democracies Die, told me that by demonizing people who are easy to demonize, Trump makes it harder for average citizens to feel comfortable publicly defending the broader principles. After all, who wants to speak up for someone celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk? “It’s harder to defend it, especially when there’s some perceived cost to speaking out against the government,” Ziblatt said. “If you’re going to get picked on in social media or have threats against you, you sort of think, Is this really what I want to spend my political capital on, defending an indefensible person? So you stay silent.”

In the case of Good, the 37-year-old mother who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis after dropping off her 6-year-old son at school, the circumstances of her killing were nebulous at best, and she hardly fit the mold of an easily vilified lawbreaker; nevertheless, Trump and his allies began attacking her almost immediately. Trump’s hard-line domestic-policy chief Stephen Miller dismissed her as an agent of “domestic terrorism,” the vice president called it “a tragedy of her own making,” and Trump falsely claimed that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer”—despite video from the scene showing that, at worst, her car might have clipped him. Regardless of the reality, the implication was clear: Good had it coming.

I was eager to understand why so much of the public seems willing to accept actions that they claim in polls and interviews not to like, so I reached out to Conor Kilgore, who produces the podcast The Focus Group for The Bulwark, a center-right website critical of Trump, and who also moderates focus groups with voters who flipped from supporting Biden in 2020 to backing Trump four years later. When I asked Kilgore if these swing voters are now hopping, froglike, out of the water to raise concerns or if they are simply accepting the nation’s gradually rising temperature, his response was unequivocal: “People have generally been less alarmed than we might like.”

“Every once in a while, you will hear people talk about authoritarian creep,” Kilgore told me. “But mainly it’s: Well, maybe this is a little overkill some of the time, but generally, I think he’s doing what needs to be done.”

He sent me some clips of Biden-Trump voters discussing Trump’s use of the National Guard in American cities. One focus-group participant, a Black man in New York, said that he disagreed with Trump using the military to address urban crime and worried that the president was “opening the door” to something even worse. When asked to explain where Trump’s actions might lead, he elaborated: “To where they have more of a choke hold on just the area or region they’re looking over, to where it spreads—like, where does it spread to next? You know what I’m saying? Like, where does it spread to next?”

In a different group, a white man in Georgia named Adam wasn’t yet ready to render a verdict on the deployment, which was then still fresh. But he seemed to accept Trump’s absolute authority to do as he pleased. “I don’t think it’s egregious that he’s doing it,” Adam said. “Because he can.”

That assessment—Trump is doing it because he can—reminded me of something Kilgore had explained during our phone call. “Broadly, people do not have the language for: We are going to descend fully into autocracy,” he’d told me. “As much as people think the political system is fundamentally broken and corrupt, they also think it’s ultimately going to trudge along fine.”

Kilgore had continued, matter-of-factly if ominously: “They kind of have faith in people to rise up, and it’s like, Oh, I don’t think we would take that lying down. Even though they might, in fact, take that lying down.”

At least for now, a year into Trump’s second term, the country seems to have settled for the illusory safety of the fetal crouch.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The United States is a global superpower, and its military trains for war in every domain. During my years as a military educator, I saw American officers wrestle with any number of scenarios designed to challenge their thinking and force them to adapt to surprises. One case we never considered, however, was how to betray and attack our own allies. We did not ask what to do if the president becomes a threatening megalomaniac who tells one of our oldest friends, Norway, that because the Nobel Committee in Oslo refuses to give him a trophy, he no longer feels “an obligation to think purely of Peace” and can instead turn his mind toward planning to wage war against NATO.

As my colleague Anne Applebaum wrote today, Donald Trump’s threatening message to the Norwegian prime minister should, in any responsible democracy, force the rest of the U.S. political system to act to control him. The president is talking about an invasion that would require “citizens of a treaty ally,” as she put it, “to become American against their will,” all because he “now genuinely lives in a different reality.” And yet neither Congress nor the sycophants in the White House seem willing to stop him.

Anne Applebaum: Trump’s letter to Norway should be the last straw

The U.S. military is obligated by law, and by every tradition of American decency, to refuse to follow illegal orders. But what about orders that may not be illegal but are clearly immoral and illogical? The president, for example, can order the Pentagon to plan for an invasion of Greenland; such an order would be little more than a direction to organize one more war game. (The military, as it sometimes does during war games, might not even use real place names, but rather use maps that look a lot like the North Atlantic as it organizes an invasion of “Verdegrun” or something.)

But after years of experience with American military officers, I believe that even these hypothetical instructions will sound utterly perverse to men and women who have served with the Danes and other NATO allies. Denmark not only was our ally during the world wars of the 20th century, but also, as my colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker has written, joined our fight against the Taliban after 9/11 and suffered significant casualties for a small nation. Their soldiers bled and died on the same battlefields as Americans.

American officers know what Trump is planning—the world knows it, because Trump won’t stop saying it—and their minds will rebel at directives to take everything they’ve prepared to do for years and apply it backwards, against the people they have trained to work with and protect. The president, in other words, will be ordering them to do something they have been trained never to do.

America’s armed forces are conditioned to obey the orders of civilian authorities, and rightly so. But these will be orders that force U.S. military minds to step into a horrifying mirror universe where the United States is the aggressor against NATO, a coalition that includes countries that have been our friends for centuries. Should Trump pursue this scheme of conquest, the military’s training will have to be shattered and reassembled into a destructive version of itself, as if doctors were asked to take lifesaving medicines, reconstitute them as poisonous isomers, and then administer them to patients.

I think back to my days as the chairman of the Strategy and Policy Department at the War College, and I can only imagine what would have happened had I convened the faculty and students and said: “It’s time for us to think about how you might plan for an American invasion of a NATO country. Small nations have no claim to sovereignty and cannot defend their borders or possessions; we should create case studies for seizing whatever we want from them.”

The most likely outcome of such a meeting is that I would have been called in to explain myself to my superiors. If I had stayed fixated on such an idea, I might have been relieved of my leadership duties. If I had remained as adamant as Trump has become on the subject, I might have been directed to seek counseling or even undergo a renewed background check. Today, however, this aggressive and immoral stance is the policy of the commander in chief—because when the president speaks, it is policy—and he may well order the military to move it from rhetoric to reality.

Some military officers will shrug at Trump’s ravings and say that orders are orders, and that yesterday’s friends are today’s enemies. Every defense organization has people in it, uniformed and civilian, who are morally hollow and see only figures on a map that must be targeted for elimination. But most Americans, and the members of the military that serves them, are decent people. They know that attacking your friends is evil and mad. I am certain that the men and women of the armed forces will be conflicted and disturbed as they try to turn Trump’s unhinged obsessions into a coherent military plan.

In the end, however, if senior officers—starting with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the heads of each service—follow Trump down this dark road, the officers and enlisted people below them will likely obey the chain of command. Such an outcome would be a tragedy, and potentially a global catastrophe.

It is not up to the armed forces to put a stop to Trump’s ghastly ideas. Every molecule in the body of almost every uniformed American service member is likely to reject doing something they have spent a lifetime training never to do, but the United States is not run by the military, nor should it be. Americans, and their elected representatives, must take this burden away from the armed forces—now.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Letter to Norway Should Be the Last Straw</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-letter-to-norway/685676/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Let me begin by quoting, in full, a letter that the president of the United States of America sent yesterday to the prime minister of Norway, Jonas Gahr Støre. The text was forwarded by the White House National Security Council to ambassadors in Washington, and was clearly intended to be widely shared. Here it is:

Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT

One could observe many things about this document. One is the childish grammar, including the strange capitalizations (“Complete and Total Control”). Another is the loose grasp of history. Donald Trump did not end eight wars. Greenland has been Danish territory for centuries. Its residents are Danish citizens who vote in Danish elections. There are many “written documents” establishing Danish sovereignty in Greenland, including some signed by the United States. In his second term, Trump has done nothing for NATO—an organization that the U.S. created and theoretically leads, and that has only ever been used in defense of American interests. If the European members of NATO have begun spending more on their own defense (budgets to which the U.S. never contributed), that’s because of the threat they feel from Russia.

Eliot A. Cohen: How to understand Trump’s obsession with Greenland

Yet what matters isn’t the specific phrases, but the overall message: Donald Trump now genuinely lives in a different reality, one in which neither grammar nor history nor the normal rules of human interaction now affect him. Also, he really is maniacally, unhealthily obsessive about the Nobel Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, not the Norwegian government and certainly not the Danish government, determines the winner of that prize. Yet Trump now not only blames Norway for failing to give it to him, but is using it as a justification for an invasion of Greenland.

Think about where this is leading. One possibility, anticipated this morning by financial markets, is a damaging trade war. Another is an American military occupation of Greenland. Try to imagine it: The U.S. Marines arrive in Nuuk, the island’s capital. Perhaps they kill some Danes; perhaps some American soldiers die too. And then what? If the invaders were Russians, they would arrest all of the politicians, put gangsters in charge, shoot people on the street for speaking Danish, change school curricula, and carry out a fake referendum to rubber-stamp the conquest. Is that the American plan too? If not, then what is it? This would not be the occupation of Iraq, which was difficult enough. U.S. troops would need to force Greenlanders, citizens of a treaty ally, to become American against their will.

For the past year, American allies around the world have tried very hard to find a theory that explains Trump’s behavior. Isolationism, neo-imperialism, and patrimonialism are all words that have been thrown around. But in the end, the president himself defeats all attempts to describe a “Trump doctrine.” He is locked into a world of his own, determined to “win” every encounter, whether in an imaginary competition for the Nobel Peace Prize or a protest from the mother of small children objecting to his masked, armed paramilitary in Minneapolis. These contests matter more to him than any long-term strategy. And of course, the need to appear victorious matters much more than Americans’ prosperity and well-being.

Read: Denmark’s army chief says he’s ready to defend Greenland

The people around Trump could find ways to stop him, as some did in his first term, but they seem too corrupt or too power-hungry to try. That leaves Republicans in Congress as the last barrier. They owe it to the American people, and to the world, to stop Trump from acting out his fantasy in Greenland and doing permanent damage to American interests. He is at risk of alienating friends in not only Europe but also India, whose leader he also snubbed for failing to nominate him for a Nobel Prize, as well as South Korea, Japan, Australia. Years of careful diplomacy, billions of dollars in trade, are now at risk because senators and representatives who know better have refused to use the powers they have to block him. Now is the time.</div>

I read a lot of reviews before buying my last couple of TVs, one of which is an LG and the other of which is a HiSense. And what review after review said was that the Sony was massively overpriced given the not that great quality, that the image quality of every Sony set I was looking at fell down in quite a number of categories, and that you would actually get better quality with a cheaper brand.

&quot;...a significant retreat for the Japanese giant whose Bravia line has long occupied the premium end of the television market. &quot;

Is this how it is described when American companies farm out their businesses?  Are we to just assume that Japan is supposed to be a servant economy?   Sony IS the premium end of the television market, why assume this changes that?  Japanese companies are everything American companies are, and they might benefit from lower costs of manufacturing too.  Also, TCL makes a good TV set.

This vibe coding fad sounds like a &quot;do what feels good&quot; philosophy. Eventually it catches up with you.&quot;Vibe&quot; anything is a sort of hedonistic outlook. I always thought vibe anything was that way. Confront your partner about being too drunk at a party? They tell you &quot;You&#39;re ruining the vibe.&quot; So at least for me, Vibe coding is the opposite of responsible and professional coding.

What&#39;s next, Crystal Affirmation Manifestation coding?

I&#39;ve actually done this a couple of times:

1. Get LLM to generate some code, perhaps refine it a bit.2. Run into a wall because the LLM cannot get past some obstacle (or it does, but then also breaks things elsewhere).3. Start a new chat, paste the code previously generated by same LLM, say &quot;I came up with this code snippet, it doesn&#39;t work. Make changes so that it does X&quot;.4. Get working code out of it.

What have you built with vibe coding tools?

In full statements, Linus says it was only used for a single module, like a plug-in of some sort.   He hand coded the rest.

With every enterprise pushing this shit, I tried it myself with a ChatGPT enterprise account through work.   Initial results were impressive, recreating a PHP program I had hand-coded myself originally but with some small improvements I asked for.

However, taking it to the next step and adding more new features the entire thing collapsed.   Even 600 lines of code is too much for it to ha

It&#39;s unfortunate if some people hear that Torvalds is vibe coding on his hobby projects, or that Karpathy (who coined the term) is, and their takeaway is that vibe coding at work, not just on their throwaway hobby projects.

For sure, it&#39;s amazing that we now live in a world where you can single shot an entire app &quot;write me a BASIC interpreter&quot;, and for sure try it and have fun with it if you like. Beyond fun it has utility too for single shot throwaway apps that wouldn&#39;t have been worth the effort if you had to to it yourself (e.g give Claude a photo of your credit card bill and ask it for the category totals - it&#39;ll write a Python program to do it).

For hobby / throwaway apps you may not care what the code looks like, what the tech stack is, whether it was well designed or not - you just want something that works.

At work you obviously need to be more professional and care about the code you are developing. Using LLMs doesn&#39;t change what is expected of you, and vibe coding isn&#39;t going to cut it. A better mindset is that you are pair-programming with the LLM, aware of what it is generating, and that you are the lead developer and systems architect.

&quot;Besides, the LLM you used two weeks ago has been replaced with a new version. The exact same prompts that worked then yield different results today. Come to think of it, it&#39;s an LLM. The same prompts and the same LLM will give you different results every time you run it. This is asking for disaster.&quot;

Yep the same is true when I put Jira tickets in and my engineers grab them.

I&#39;m a professional developer with decades of enterprise experience.  Like many of us, I have home projects.  A week ago I signed up for $10/month CoPilot, because I wanted to try my hand at mobile development - something I&#39;ve never done.  Fortunately, I&#39;m experienced in React and that is a viable platform for mobile development, but that doesn&#39;t address all the environment-specific items that differ between mobile and web development.

I engaged CoPilot to ask for development platform options - it gave me two

If people think they can vibe-code SAP out of business, that is a completely different understanding of the term vibe-coding compared to someone like Torvalds, who probably thinks in C++ by now, letting AI do the grunt-work and provide a basic construct he can then beautify and improve.

If a CEO extrapolates that he can replace an experienced miner with a yound man with a CAT machine, all he will produce is a cave-in.

You want to give the CAT to the experienced miner.

So,... a miner is a coder and code is a cave and a yound man is graduate,.. a CAT is some kind of digging machine and unsupportable code is an unsupportable cave which results in a cave-in

They didn&#39;t know back then of the full potential of being dickheads.

UAP&#39;s (UFO&#39;s) are pretty much a fiction, part of it owing to not understanding the physics of things, and part of it because the pilots of jets/planes and other high speed military craft are not scientists and don&#39;t think logically about werid stuff.

Like breaking &quot;the speed of sound&quot; people often don&#39;t realize creates a shockwave which causes damage. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t see any commercial aircraft at M1+, this is also why like &quot;breaking the speed of light&quot; is impossible, because if you could a

I&#39;m not sure you got the FTL part right. Light is a constant in all frames of reference, so when you move close to speed of light (not faster), the light being sent out from stars would still be light speed even in your frame of reference, not &quot;slower&quot;. That&#39;s the core of relativity theory.

That said, you&#39;d still have lots of distorsional effects.

FTL would involve some kind of spacetime warping, check out Alcubierre Drive (a theoretical calculation for it could work).

Interestingly I suspect the Naval pilots who released those three videos a decade or so ago understood the science very well.

* They named one video &quot;Gofast&quot;, because their plane was going fast while imaging something slow, but knew on the video the object looked fast.

* They named another video &quot;Gimbal&quot;, because it showed the gimbal of a camera spinning quickly, which gives the illusion of the object jumping quickly.

One part of that skillset is good observation.  But not a skillset that includes looking at something, and instantly determining it is a vehicle of  extraterrestrial source.

UAP&#39;s (UFO&#39;s) are pretty much a fiction, part of it owing to not understanding the physics of things, and part of it because the pilots of jets/planes and other high speed military craft are not scientists and don&#39;t think logically about werid stuff.

One of the strangest aspects of this whole &quot;pilots are the arbiters of UFO information&quot; is that while I know a number of pilots, they are in general very confident, often quite likable people with a particular skillset for flying. One part of that skillset is good observation.  But not a skillset that includes looking at something, and instantly determining it is a vehicle of  extraterrestrial source.

So what you&#39;re saying is, &quot;They&#39;re saying it&#39;s aliens, but it&#39;s not aliens&quot;?

So what you&#39;re saying is, &quot;They&#39;re saying it&#39;s aliens, but it&#39;s not aliens&quot;?What a topsy-turvy world.See what Trump&#39;s done to us.

They will also show that there&#39;s a crashed space ship under the inland ice on Greenland, and only USA is able to undertake the endeavour to excavate it and understand its technology.

I actually think the current US administration is proof there isn&#39;t Aliens/UFOs.

Because if there was , do we actually think Trump wouldn&#39;t bark it out at 3am in some sort of enraged twitter freakout, (ie every other day)

More to the point, he hasn&#39;t threatened to tariff UFOs for using U.S. airspace. Come to think of it, he might just do that as yet one more distraction from releasing the Epstein Files.

I agree with the engagement motivation hypothesis.  Including the meta-engagement, like this thread.  There&#39;s profit to be found in the long tail!

The current administration isn&#39;t releasing controversial files on other matters so I wouldn&#39;t worry about the files that explain why the host turns orange after being inhabited by a non-terrestrial entity. They should be worried about 3 AM tweets instead.

What odds will ANY of you give me for public acceptance and acknowledgement that ETs exist?

Either this year, or next year, by an official government department in a Western nation.

Give me some decent odds, and I&#39;m happy to have a little wager with you.

Call me whatever names you like, I&#39;m more than happy to take your money.

Polymaket&#39;s got the odds at 11% right now, so you don&#39;t really stand to make that much unfortunately.

What odds will ANY of you give me for public acceptance and acknowledgement that ETs exist?As long as you&#39;re not talking specifically about those ugly &quot;phone home&quot; E.T.s, it is pretty much a certainty that some form of extraterrestrial intelligence does exist. Mathematical probability, given the size of the universe.However...Whether they would ever be able to reach us or contact us is a different matter altogether. They might not even have our level of technology. And even if they did, there is the issue of insane distances, again given the size of the universe. This problem is summarily glossed

It is common to use strange threats for training exercises.  It means the training controller can play games to put normal plans out of play.  The CDC has been using zombie attacks for this reason for years plus it helps keep teams entertained while being able to evaluate the leadership parts of the teams.  The CDC training requires a whole bunch of volunteers so zombies work for that.  The military uses similar techniques for asymmetric warfare.

... the usa and russia invading Europa at the same time.

I came here to say that Trump/Putin owning the world is probably more devastating than aliens, so planning for aliens is probably a useful thought exercise.

The US president is currently in the process of breaking up NATO, threatening invasion to Greenland, quote, &quot;Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.&quot; and starting another tariff war with the EU. All while Russia is invading Europe, China is getting ready to invade Taiwan (and possibly also Russia). The federal reserve will soon not be independent anymore, effectively letting the president dictate interest rates. Ungodly amounts of money and energy are going towards something

It seems to me there should be 2 or 3 unmanned moon-loop missions to iron out nearly all known glitches. And perhaps do some stress-testing while at it: test the margins. If something is rated for 90 psi, test it at 89.9 while in space.

Something rated for 90 psi is always tested well above 90 psi. An elevator rated for 4500 pounds is tested with something like 6000 pounds or even more etc. etc.

Can someone convert these units to ones that the aerospace industry actually uses?Yes: 90 psi is about a gazillion pascals.

Wow, that&#39;s one big (fig) newton [youtu.be].

Can someone convert these units to ones that the aerospace industry actually uses?

But that&#39;s in the lab, not in space. If you over-jack something in space and it bursts, damaging the craft, then you can&#39;t test anything else. Maybe there&#39;s a happy medium?

Precisely what makes you think that the laws of physics work differently in space vs on earth? I know this is difficult for Americans and their funky units, but in the rest of the world space is just the number 1. As in 1 bar or 1 atmosphere. Want to rate something for 90bar overpressure on the ground? Rate it for 91bar in space. Replicating the other conditions is trivial.

Also pressure containing equipment is generally tested to a factor of 2.5-3x the rated pressure, always, regardless of where something g

They are racing against the Chinese now. The big blocker is the lander. There are two in development, SpaceX&#39;s Starship, and Blue Origin&#39;s more traditional one. Both are a fair way off being ready for testing, and they will likely want to do an automated landing and return to orbit before sending people.

China has the rockets they need to do the mission, and has soft landed robots on the moon. Their lander is coming along, and so it really is a race at this point.

            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s kinda fun. There are events that run when they expect another drop to fall.

It is the dream of every scientist - build the one experiment that you, your students and their students can retire on.

But what exactly are we learning from it?

Sometimes, experiments are worth doing not because we don&#39;t know what the results of the experiment will be, but because young future scientists are constantly being born, and will learn from witnessing the experiment. For some, the fanfare around the latest drip will be the spark that lights a lifelong desire to pursue science. That alone makes it worthwhile.

Mostly it&#39;s a teaching tool/exhibit these days.

This is the experiment that was actually used to determine the relative viscosity of pitch, and there are some other actual materials science findings that were produced from it... admittedly quite some time ago.

I actually do think it is an interesting question - you need continuity of several things (broader social stability, specific organizational stability, a community of people interested enough to bother keeping it going) without any of the usual things that keep something going (profit motive, government edict, etc.)

But I like proof-by-doing sorts of things in general.

There are some experiments that are not possible to complete within a scientist&#39;s lifetime. All of the data-gathering over decades or even centuries is a gift to future generations. Many observations over a very long time-frame in astronomy, weather, solar activity, etc., have led to new understandings and theories.

I&#39;m reminded of a musical analog to this story: ASLSP  [wikipedia.org] by John Cage. The name is roughly a mnemonic for As Slow As Possible. Although it was originally a piano piece intended for concert or recita

We&#39;re leaning how slowly something can drip. It&#39;s just like when you ask someone &quot;how small can you jump?&quot; or &quot;how quietly can you clap?&quot;

That there are worse jobs than watching paint dry.

But what exactly are we learning from it?That a fluid can be viscose while appearing solid. Are you the kind of person who goes into a Chemistry lecture and thinks the point of mixing potassium iodate, malonic acid/manganese sulphate, and hydrogen peroxide together is to get you to think that blue is a pretty colour?There are hundreds of thousands of students who learned about pitch and its viscosity from walking past this in the Physics building at UQ over the past 100 years.But you I&#39;m sure know everything in life already, we all did, but at som

But what exactly are we learning from it?

I once read that it had to be covered with a glass bell because it was so distracting to those around it. We need to figure out what the heck was put into that pile.

Here&#39;s another long-running experiment [nih.gov] to test how long seeds can be stored.

The Rothamsted Classical Experiments [rothamsted.ac.uk] have been going since 1843.

Pitch pans have been used since the nineteen-hundreds in construction to weatherproof roof penetrations. You need some electrical conduit or some such on the roof, esp. a flat commercial roof, you&#39;d build a sheetmetal enclosure and fill it with pitch after extending the conduit through the roof plate.

Some of the pitch always drips through the roof eventually, sticking to everything in sight, but never quite as well as to human clothing and skin. One contractor I knew would&#39;nt  allow it on his job sites, referring to it as the black death.

No this *IS* the experiment we performed. It just happens to still be running. Maybe your  contractors in the early 1900s learned something from this which was also done in the early 1900s.

Will a pitch droplet refuse to detach while being observed? Just how long can it be held suspended due to observation? Are quantum effects involved? :-P

Will a pitch droplet refuse to detach while being observed?Possibly. Note that modern attempts to monitor &quot;mysteriously&quot; fail.Are quantum effects involved? It may be the same QE as what happens to missing socks.

Gremlins... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

No - not the ones the films were made about...

You have no idea how right you are. In 2000 it got camera shy and waited for the webcam to go offline to drop causing everyone to not observe it happening. https://science.slashdot.org/s... [slashdot.org] (the story was about a different experiment but there was a passing comment about UQ&#39;s there.

Does the existence of pitch drops, implies the existence of (presumably Australian) drop grues?

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

            <h2>The Real Reason the DOJ’s Rampage Against Trump’s Enemies Kicked Up a Notch This Week</h2>

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/ai_framework_flaws_enterprise_clouds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two &quot;easy-to-exploit&quot; vulnerabilities in the popular open-source AI framework Chainlit put major enterprises&#39; cloud environments at risk of leaking data or even full takeover, according to cyber-threat exposure startup Zafran.

Chainlit is a Python package that organizations can use to build production-ready AI chatbots and applications. Corporations can either use Chainlit&#39;s built-in UI and backend, or create their own frontend on top of Chainlit&#39;s backend. It also integrates with other tools and platforms including LangChain, OpenAI, Bedrock, and LlamaIndex, and supports authentication and cloud deployment options.

It&#39;s downloaded about 700,000 times every month and saw 5 million downloads last year.

The two vulnerabilities are CVE-2026-22218, which allows arbitrary file read, and CVE-2026-22219, which can lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks on the servers hosting AI applications.

While Zafran didn&#39;t see any indications of in-the-wild exploitation, &quot;the internet-facing applications we observed belonged to the financial services and energy sectors, and universities are also using this framework,&quot; CTO Ben Seri told The Register.

Zafran disclosed the bugs to the project&#39;s maintainers in November, and a month later, Chainlit released a patched version (2.9.4) that fixes the flaws. So if you use Chainlit, make sure to update the framework to the fixed release.

The arbitrary file read flaw, CVE-2026-22218, has to do with how the framework handles elements – these are pieces of content, such as a file or image, that can be attached to a message. It can be triggered by sending a malicious update element request with a tampered custom element, and abused to exfiltrate environment variables by reading /proc/self/environ.

&quot;These variables often contain highly sensitive values that the system and enterprise depend on, including API keys, credentials, internal file paths, internal IPs, and ports,&quot; according to Zafran&#39;s analysis, shared with The Register ahead of publication. &quot;This is mostly dangerous in AI systems where the servers have access to internal data of the company to provide a tailored chatbot experience to their users.&quot;

In environments where authentication is enabled, attackers can steal secrets used to sign authentication tokens (CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET). These secrets, when combined with user identifiers – leaked from databases or inferred from organization emails – can be abused to forge authentication tokens and fully take over users&#39; Chainlit accounts.

Other environment variables up for grabs may include cloud credentials – such as AWS_SECRET_KEY – that Chainlit requires for cloud storage, along with sensitive API keys or the addresses and names of internal services.

Plus, an attacker can probe these addresses using the second SSRF vulnerability to access sensitive data from internal REST APIs.

Zafran found the SSRF vulnerability, CVE-2026-22219, in the SQLAlchemy data layer. This one is triggered in the same way as the arbitrary file read – via a tampered custom element. Then, the attacker can retrieve the copied file by extracting the element&#39;s &quot;chainlit key&quot; property from the metadata, download the file to an attacker-controlled computer, and query the file to access conversation history.

According to Seri, the vulnerabilities are &quot;easy to exploit,&quot; and can be combined in multiple ways to leak sensitive data, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the system.

&quot;An attacker only needs to send a simple command and change one value to point to the file or URL they want to access,&quot; he said.

&quot;Regarding how the vulnerabilities can be combined, SSRF typically requires knowledge of the server environment,&quot; Seri added. &quot;By leveraging the read-file vulnerability to leak that information, such as environment details or internal addresses, it becomes much easier to successfully carry out the SSRF attack.&quot;

Companies increasingly use AI frameworks to build their own AI chatbots and apps, and Seri acknowledges that organizations are &quot;working under very tight timelines to deliver fully functioning AI systems that integrate with highly sensitive data.&quot;

Using third-party frameworks and open-source code allows development teams to move fast – and it introduces new risks to the environment.

&quot;The risk is not the use of third-party code by itself, but the combination of rapid integration, limited understanding of the added code, and reliance on external maintainers for security and code quality,&quot; Seri said. &quot;As a result, organizations end up deploying backend servers that communicate with clients, cloud resources, and LLMs, creating multiple entry points where vulnerabilities can emerge and put the system at risk.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If 2025 proved anything about PCs, it&#39;s that corporate IT will upgrade hardware out of necessity long before it does so out of AI-fueled excitement.

According to new figures from Gartner released on Tuesday, worldwide PC shipments into the channel jumped 9.3 percent in Q4 and ended the year up 9.1 percent overall, marking the first meaningful rebound after a bruising post-pandemic slump.

&quot;This marks a significant turnaround following two years of steep decline in 2022 and 2023, and only modest gains in 2024,&quot; Gartner swooned.

The analyst says the recovery was driven by channel shipments into the commercial market, not by consumers piling into stores or a sudden rush for AI PCs. In practice, that mostly means companies replacing old machines that were already overdue for retirement. In other words, this was less about AI PCs and more about businesses discovering that a five-year-old laptop running on borrowed time is not, in fact, a long-term IT strategy.

The shift to Windows 11 is a big part of what finally forced the issue. As Microsoft steadily tightens the screws on older versions of Windows, IT departments are being left with little choice but to replace machines that can&#39;t meet the new OS&#39;s hardware requirements, whether or not they have any interest in Copilot, neural processing units, or other AI-flavored extras.

That fits with recent findings from Context, which found that buyers still put the basics first when choosing PCs. Price, battery life, and performance continue to matter far more than whether a laptop can accelerate a chatbot locally, with AI still generally treated as a nice-to-have rather than a deciding factor.

PC makers saw a late-year boost as businesses moved purchases forward to get ahead of expected component price increases, particularly in memory, according to Gartner&#39;s numbers. That scramble played to the strengths of the usual incumbents.

Lenovo held on to the top spot globally, shipping about 19.4 million units in the quarter, while HP moved roughly 15.4 million and Dell around 11.7 million, all increasing their share versus a year earlier.

The result is a PC recovery that looks healthy on paper but is conservative in character. For most organizations, the upgrades are happening out of necessity rather than excitement. Windows 11 deadlines, security requirements, and the slow grind of fleet obsolescence are doing far more work than any marketing pitch about on-device intelligence.

If AI PCs are meant to spark a new upgrade supercycle, the data suggests they&#39;ll have to wait their turn behind the far less fashionable forces of compliance, manageability, and machines that simply don&#39;t crash when you unplug them. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/anthropic_prompt_injection_flaws/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has fixed three bugs in its official Git MCP server that researchers say can be chained with other MCP tools to remotely execute malicious code or overwrite files via prompt injection.

The Git MCP server, mcp-server-git, connects AI tools such as Copilot, Claude, and Cursor to Git repositories and the GitHub platform, allowing them to read repositories and code files, and automate workflows, all using natural language interactions.

Agentic AI security startup Cyata found a way to exploit the vulnerabilities - a path validation bypass flaw (CVE-2025-68145), an unrestricted git_init issue (CVE-2025-68143), and an argument injection in git_diff (CVE-2025-68144) - and chain the Git MCP server with the Filesystem MCP server to achieve code execution.

&quot;Agentic systems break in unexpected ways when multiple components interact. Each MCP server might look safe in isolation, but combine two of them, Git and Filesystem in this case, and you get a toxic combination,&quot; Cyata security researcher Yarden Porat told The Register, adding that there&#39;s no indication that attackers exploited the bugs in the wild.

&quot;As organizations adopt more complex agentic systems with multiple tools and integrations, these combinations will multiply,&quot; Porat said.

Cyata reported the three vulnerabilities to Anthropic in June, and the AI company fixed them in December. The flaws affect default deployments of mcp-server-git prior to 2025.12.18 - so make sure you&#39;re using the updated version.

The Register reached out to Anthropic for this story, but the company did not respond to our inquiries.

In a Tuesday report shared with The Register ahead of publication, Cyata says the issues stem from the way AI systems connect to external data sources.

In 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard that enables LLMs to interact with these other systems - filesystems, databases, APIs, messaging platforms, and development tools like Git. MCP servers act as the bridge between the model and external sources, providing the AI with access to the data or tools they need.

As we&#39;ve seen repeatedly over the past year, LLMs can be manipulated into doing things they&#39;re not supposed to do via prompt injection, which happens when attacker-controlled input causes an AI system to follow unintended instructions. It&#39;s a problem that&#39;s not going away anytime soon - and may never.

There are two types: indirect and direct. Direct prompt injection happens when someone directly submits malicious input, while indirect injection happens when content contains hidden commands that AI then follows as if the user had entered them.

This attack abuses the three now-fixed vulnerabilities.

CVE-2025-68145: The --repository flag is supposed to restrict the MCP server to a specific repository path. However, the server didn&#39;t validate that repo_path arguments in subsequent tool calls within that configured path, thus allowing an attacker to bypass security boundaries and access any repository on the system.

CVE-2025-68143: The git_init tool accepted arbitrary filesystem paths and created Git repositories without any validation, allowing any directory to be turned into a Git repository and eligible for subsequent git operations through the MCP server. To fix this, Anthropic removed the git_init tool from the server.

CVE-2025-68144: The git_diff and git_checkout functions passed user-controlled arguments directly to the GitPython library without sanitization. &quot;By injecting &#39;--output=/path/to/file&#39; into the &#39;target&#39; field, an attacker could overwrite any file with an empty diff,&quot; and delete files, Cyata explained in the report.

As Porat explained to us, the attack uses indirect prompt injection: &quot;Your IDE reads something malicious, a README file, a webpage, a GitHub issue, somewhere the attacker has planted instructions,&quot; he said.

The vulnerabilities, when combined with the Filesystem MCP server, abuse Git&#39;s smudge and clean filters, which execute shell commands defined in repository configuration files, and enable remote code execution.

According to Porat, it&#39;s a four-step process:

This attack illustrates how, as more AI agents move into production, security has to keep pace.

&quot;Security teams can&#39;t evaluate each MCP server in a vacuum,&quot; Porat said. &quot;They need to assess the effective permissions of the entire agentic system, understand what tools can be chained together, and put controls in place. MCPs expand what agents can do, but they also expand the attack surface. Trust shouldn&#39;t be assumed, it needs to be verified and controlled.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybercrime has entered its AI era, with criminals now using weaponized language models and deepfakes as cheap, off-the-shelf infrastructure rather than experimental tools, according to researchers at Group-IB.

In its latest whitepaper, the cybersec biz argues that AI has become the plumbing of modern cybercrime, quietly turning skills that once took time and talent into services that anyone with a credit card and a Telegram account can rent.

This isn&#39;t just a passing fad, according to Group-IB&#39;s numbers, which show mentions of AI on dark web forums up 371 percent since 2019, with replies rising even faster – almost twelvefold. AI-related threads were everywhere, racking up more than 23,000 new posts and almost 300,000 replies in 2025.

According to Group-IB, AI has done what automation always does: it took something fiddly and made it fast. The stages of an attack that once needed planning and specialist hands can now be pushed through automated workflows and sold on subscription, complete with the sort of pricing and packaging you&#39;d expect from a shady SaaS outfit.

One of the uglier trends in the report is the rise of so-called Dark LLMs – self-hosted language models built for scams and malware rather than polite conversation. Group-IB says several vendors are already selling them for as little as $30 a month, with more than 1,000 users between them. Unlike jailbroken mainstream chatbots, these things are meant to stay out of sight, run behind Tor, and ignore safety rules by design.

Running alongside the Dark LLM market is a booming trade in deepfakes and impersonation tools. Group-IB says complete synthetic identity kits, including AI-generated faces and voices, can now be bought for about $5. Sales spiked sharply in 2024 and kept climbing through 2025, pointing to a market that continues to grow.

There&#39;s real damage behind the numbers, too. Group-IB says deepfake fraud caused $347 million in verified losses in a single quarter, including everything from cloned executives to fake video calls. In one case, the firm helped a bank spot more than 8,000 deepfake-driven fraud attempts over eight months.

Group-IB found that scam call centers were using synthetic voices for first contact, with language models coaching the humans as they go. Malware developers are also starting to test AI-assisted tools for reconnaissance and persistence, with early hints of more autonomous attacks down the line.

&quot;From the frontlines of cybercrime, we see AI giving criminals unprecedented reach,&quot; said Anton Ushakov, head of Group-IB&#39;s Cybercrime Investigations Unit. &quot;Today it helps scale scams with ease and hyper-personalization at a level never seen before. Tomorrow, autonomous AI could carry out attacks that once required human expertise.&quot;

From a defensive point of view, AI removes a lot of the usual clues. When voices, text, and video can all be generated on demand with off-the-shelf software, it becomes much harder to work out who&#39;s really behind an attack. Group-IB&#39;s view is that this leaves static defenses struggling.

In other words, cybercrime hasn&#39;t reinvented itself. It has just automated the old tricks, put them on subscription, and scaled them globally – and as ever, everyone else gets to deal with the mess. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/chen_shift_reboot_windows/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft&#39;s Raymond Chen has explained why holding down Shift during a Windows 95 restart would get the system up and running again far faster than a full reboot.

Some old hands will nod sagely over the &quot;Shift during Restart&quot; trick, while others will wish they&#39;d known about it three decades ago, given how often Windows 95 needed coaxing back to life.

Chen explained that the EW_RESTART­WINDOWS flag was passed to the old 16-bit ExitWindows function. The 16-bit Windows kernel shut down, then the 32-bit virtual memory manager shut down, before the CPU finally dropped back into real mode, and handed control to win.com.

For the uninitiated, real mode is how x86-compatible CPUs start – it&#39;s a legacy mode with direct hardware access that&#39;s now just a stepping stone to protected mode, which modern operating systems use. When win.com (running in real mode) received control, the CPU would signal it to start protected-mode Windows.

Chen noted that .com files are implicitly given all the remaining conventional memory upon launch. The memory can be released back to the system for other programs.

&quot;In win.com&#39;s case,&quot; said Chen, &quot;it releases all the memory beyond its own image back to the system so that there is a single large contiguous block of memory for loading protected-mode Windows.

&quot;If somebody had allocated memory in the space that win.com had given up for protected-mode Windows, then conventional memory will be fragmented, and the &#39;try to get the system back into the same state that it was in back when win.com had been freshly launched&#39; is not successful because the expected memory layout was &#39;one giant contiguous block of memory.&#39;

&quot;In that case, win.com says, &#39;Sorry, I can&#39;t do what you asked&#39; and falls back to a full reboot.&quot;

Cue some thumb twiddling while the PC reboots.

Otherwise, win.com launched protected-mode Windows, and before long, the familiar user interface appeared on the user&#39;s screen.

It&#39;s a neat bit of engineering that enabled fast restarts, even if it could be undone by some naughty bit of code (say, from a device driver) grabbing that memory. And there was none of the &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve got an update that will probably break something&quot; that bedevils modern Windows users. ®

            <h2>Global economy shrugs off US tariff shock, tech spending does heavy lifting</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/global_economy_shrugs_off_us/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The global economy has proved more resilient than many expected in the wake of US tariff shocks, with the International Monetary Fund now projecting worldwide growth of 3.3 percent in 2026 as a surge in AI investment helps offset trade disruption.

According to the IMF, the damage from higher US tariffs has so far been limited, with companies finding ways around the disruption by reshuffling supply chains and exports. The latest forecast is marginally stronger than in the autumn, suggesting the tariff hit has been more of a drag than a derailment.

&quot;Remarkably, current projections are broadly unchanged from a year earlier, as the global economy shakes off the immediate impact of the tariff shock,&quot; it said.

According to the IMF, the key factor behind that resilience is a surge in technology-driven investment, particularly in the US, with AI playing a central role. In the States, IT spending now takes up a bigger slice of the economy than at any point since the early 2000s, a shift the IMF links to Washington&#39;s ability to shrug off trade headwinds better than most of its peers. On that basis, the Fund expects US growth to hit 2.4 percent in 2026, comfortably ahead of other advanced economies.

Europe, by contrast, is stuck in lower gear. The IMF expects Germany to grow by 1.1 percent in 2026, France by 1.0 percent, and the UK by 1.3 percent. While technology investment is helping prop up global growth, the Fund says the benefits are heavily skewed toward the US, leaving Europe with a more modest outlook.

Elsewhere, the picture is patchy. China is forecast to grow by 4.5 percent in 2026, while Japan barely scrapes 0.7 percent. India remains the standout at 6.4 percent, with Brazil at 1.6 percent, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria around 4.5 percent, and Russia trailing on 0.8 percent.

The IMF says this bout of growth has less to do with consumers spending freely and more to do with money flowing into new technologies. That has softened the hit from tariffs, but it also leaves growth resting on a narrower base, with AI-heavy sectors carrying much of the load.

The IMF also flags the risk on the other side of the bet. If the promised AI productivity gains fail to materialize, or if financing tightens, the same concentration that has up to now supported growth could become a problem. In that case, the Fund warns, a slowdown in tech investment would not stay contained for long.

&quot;The current tech boom raises important upside and downside risks for the global economy,&quot; the IMF said. &quot;On the upside, AI could start to deliver on its productivity promises, raising US and global activity by 0.3 percent this year, relative to the baseline. On the downside, AI firms could fail to deliver earnings commensurate with their lofty valuations, and investor sentiment could sour.&quot;

For now, the IMF thinks the global economy is still moving in the right direction, despite trade friction and tariff threats. Growth is being carried less by trade and more by investment, especially in technology. That has kept the numbers ticking over, but it also means the margin for error is thinner than it looks. ®

On The Vergecast: The new king of EVs, AI is coming for your health records, and the many faces of screentime.

The Model S. The Mach-E. The Ioniq. The… Dolphin Surf? That’s right, friends: There’s a new biggest name in EVs, and it means you might soon be cruising down the highway in the Dolphin Surf. And you might love it.

After years of Tesla dominance, a Chinese company called BYD has become the world’s biggest seller of electric vehicles. On this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge’s Andy Hawkins explains where BYD came from, why its cars are so compelling, and what its rise means for the future of EVs. He also helps us figure out whether and when BYD cars might come to the US and how an influx of Chinese cars — which the influencers already love — could change the car market in a big way. For now, your Dolphin Surf will cost a small fortune, but that may not be the case forever.

﻿Netflix is hoping to expedite the acquisition by replacing its previous mixed cash and stock deal.

Netflix has updated the acquisition terms for its Warner Bros. Discovery offer to an all-cash deal, replacing its initial $82.7 billion cash and stock agreement. The changes are designed to expedite the sale of WBD studios and streaming businesses, following repeated attempts by rival bidder Paramount to pressure shareholders into accepting its own $108 billion all-cash offer.

“The WBD Board continues to support and unanimously recommend our transaction, and we are confident that it will deliver the best outcome for stockholders, consumers, creators, and the broader entertainment community,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix. “Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty at $27.75 per share in cash, plus the value from the planned separation of Discovery Global.”

The amended transaction will be financed through a combination of cash on hand, available credit and other financing, and was unanimously approved by both Netflix’s and WBD’s boards. Closing the overall acquisition deal is still subject to regulatory and WBD shareholder approvals.

Under the terms of the original transaction agreement announced by Netflix on December 5th, each WBD shareholder was set to receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock, with conditions in place if Netflix’s share price falls below $97.91. Netflix shares fell below that threshold by December 8th, with Paramount launching a self-described “superior” all-cash hostile takeover bid that same day, saying the agreement with Netflix leaves WBD shareholders reliant on “a complex and volatile mix of equity and cash.”

Rumors of the changes were reported by Bloomberg on January 13th, citing people familiar with the revision discussions. WBD has already rejected Paramount’s takeover efforts and is now being sued by the David Ellison-helmed company to reveal more details about the Netflix merger deal. By revising to an all-cash deal, Netflix is trying to expedite the acquisition and avoid further opposition, be that from rival bidders or regulatory processes it will need to clear to finalize the merger.

﻿Page Match lets you scan a page to jump right to that part of an audiobook

Spotify appears to be working on a novel feature that will allow audiobook listeners to pick up where they left off in the physical book. Android Authority reports that version 9.1.18.282 of the Spotify app includes code references to a Page Match beta feature that can quickly sync audiobooks on the platform with their paper and ebook counterparts.

Using Page Match will require users to unlock or purchase the audiobook on Spotify and own either the paper or ebook version of the same book. The feature works by scanning the page you’re currently reading with your device camera, using optical character recognition (OCR) to identify passages that are then matched to specific timestamps in the audiobook.

The aim is to spare you from having to fast-forward and rewind manually, but it seems Page Match could also work in reverse. Code snippets suggest that Spotify will also display the page number that corresponds to your current audiobook position, making it easier for bibliophiles to quickly jump between listening and physical reading. This is backed up by Spotify’s own description of the feature, which can “match your progress from the book page to the audiobook — and back again.” Page numbers can vary by book edition, however, which could cause some complications.

Spotify has yet to announce Page Match, so there’s no guarantee that it’ll roll out publicly. The OCR for Page Match also isn’t always reliable, with Android Authority reporting that Spotify will ask you to scan a nearby page if it’s unable to identify the passage you’re reading.

Amazon has a similar feature called Whispersync for Voice that synchronizes Audible audiobooks with Kindle ebooks, but that solution doesn’t support syncing with paper books or ebooks on other platforms. Page Match doesn’t have those limitations, which could make it easier for people to put down their physical books and continue listening while driving, cooking, and doing other hands-on activities — something I do regularly to remain productive.

Loading screens point to an imminent test of ad-supported Xbox streaming.

Over the weekend, Microsoft updated its Xbox app with loading screens for Xbox Cloud Gaming that mention “1 hour of ad-supported playtime per session.” That lines up with Microsoft’s internal testing, which has been limited to one-hour sessions, with up to five hours free per month.

Sources told me in October that internal testing includes around two minutes of preroll ads before a game is available to stream for free through Xbox Cloud Gaming. The free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will include the ability to stream some games you own, as well as trying out eligible Free Play Days titles over a weekend. You’ll also be able to stream Xbox Retro Classics games with preroll ads.

Microsoft officially confirmed it was testing the ad-supported service just weeks after my report, and I’m now expecting it to be officially announced and in public testing in the coming weeks.

            <div id="article-text">﻿The two companies are planning to form a new joint venture that will carry the ‘Sony’ and ‘Bravia’ branding.

﻿The two companies are planning to form a new joint venture that will carry the ‘Sony’ and ‘Bravia’ branding.

Sony has announced plans to spin off its TV hardware business, shifting it to a new joint venture with TCL. The two companies have signed a nonbinding agreement for Sony’s home entertainment business, with TCL set to hold a 51 percent stake in the new venture and Sony holding 49 percent.

With this partnership, TCL is elevating itself into the premium television landscape after innovating with technology over the last few years. If the deal goes through it would mark the end of an era for Sony, and could open the door for cheaper Bravia TVs built with excellent Sony image processing and leading TCL tech.

Sony and TCL are aiming to finalize binding agreements by the end of March, and start operating the new joint company in April 2027, subject to regulatory approvals and other partnership conditions.

The new company is expected to retain “Sony” and “Bravia” branding for its future products and will handle global operations from product development and design to manufacturing, sales, and logistics for TVs and home audio equipment. Sony says that the partnership will leverage Sony’s picture and audio tech, brand value, supply chain management, and other operational expertise. This will combine with TCL’s own display technology, vertical supply chain strength, global market presence, and end-to-end cost efficiency.

In the announcement, Sony CEO Kimio Maki says that combining the two companies will allow Sony and TCL to “create new customer value in the home entertainment field, delivering even more captivating audio and visual experiences to customers worldwide.” TCL chairperson DU Juan says that under the new venture, TCL expects “to elevate our brand value, achieve greater scale, and optimize the supply chain in order to deliver superior products and services to our customers.”

            <div id="article-text">After teasing 10,000mAh and 15,000mAh concept devices, Realme is ready to make those big batteries a reality with the P4 Power, which launches in India on January 29th with a 10,001mAh capacity.

Realme says the P4 Power will last for three and a half days of light use, which I can believe — I got between two and three days’ battery with the 7,500mAh Oppo Find X9 Pro. Maybe more impressively, the P4 Power supports 27W reverse charging, fast enough that this could double as a power bank for some other devices.

We’ve seen bigger batteries, but not often in phones this size — the P4 Power only weighs 218g, and looks fairly slim, thanks to using a silicon-carbon battery. It might not quite beat the 216g, 8mm-thick Honor Power 2, which has a fractionally larger 10,080mAh battery, but that’s only available in China — an India release means the P4 Power will be much easier for the rest of us to get hold of.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1131462/the-uk-government-is-backing-ai-scientists-that-can-run-their-own-experiments/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A number of startups and universities that are building AI scientists to design and run experiments in the lab, including robot biologists and chemists, have just won extra funding from the UK government agency that funds moonshot R&D. The competition, set up by ARIA (Advanced Research and Invention Agency), gives a clear sense of how fast this technology is moving, with the agency receiving 245 proposals from research teams that are already building tools that can automate increasing amounts of lab work.

ARIA defines an AI scientist as a system that can run an entire scientific workflow, coming up with hypotheses, designing and running experiments to test those hypotheses, and then analyzing the results. In many cases, the system may then feed those results back into itself and run the loop again and again. Human scientists become overseers, coming up with the initial research questions and then letting the AI scientist get on with the grunt work.

“There are better uses for a PhD student than waiting around in a lab until 3am to make sure an experiment is run to the end,” says Ant Rowstron, ARIA’s chief technology officer.

ARIA picked 12 projects to fund from the 245 proposals, doubling the amount of funding it had intended to allocate because of the large number and high quality of submissions. Half the teams are from the UK; the rest are from the US and Europe. Some of the teams are from universities, some from industry. Each will get around £500,000 (around $675,000) to cover 9 months’ work. At the end of that time, they should be able to demonstrate that their AI scientist was able to come up with novel findings.

Winning teams include Lila Sciences, a US company that is building what it calls an AI NanoScientist, a system that will design and run experiments to discover the best ways to compose and process quantum dots, which are nanometer-scale semiconductor particles used in medical imaging, solar panels and QLED TVs.

“We are using the funds and time to prove a point,” says Rafa Gómez-Bombarelli at Lila Sciences: “The grant lets us design a real AI robotics loop around a focused scientific problem, generate evidence that it works, and document the playbook so others can reproduce and extend it.”

Another team, from the University of Liverpool, UK, is building a robot chemist, which runs multiple experiments at once and uses a vision language model to help troubleshoot when the robot makes an error.

And Humanis AI, a startup based in London, is developing an AI scientist called ThetaWorld, which is using LLMs to design experiments to study the physical and chemical interactions that are important for the performance of batteries. The experiments will then be run in an automated lab by Sandia National Laboratories in the US.

Compared to the £5 million projects spanning 2-3 years that ARIA usually funds, £500,000 is small change. But that was the idea, says Rowstron: It’s an experiment on ARIA’s part too. By funding a range of projects for a short amount of time, the agency is taking the temperature at the cutting edge to determine how the way science is done is changing, and how fast. What it learns will become the baseline for funding future large-scale projects.

Rowstron acknowledges there’s a lot of hype, especially now that most of the top AI companies have teams focused on science. When results are shared by press release and not peer review, it can be hard to know what the technology can and can’t do. “That’s always a challenge for a research agency trying to fund the frontier,” he says. “To do things at the frontier we&#39;ve got to know what the frontier is.”

For now, the cutting edge involves agentic systems calling up other existing tools on the fly. “They&#39;re running things like large language models to do the ideation, and then they use other models to do optimization and run experiments,” says Rowstron. “And then they feed the results back round.”

Rowstron sees the technology stacked in tiers. At the bottom are AI tools designed by humans for humans, such as AlphaFold. These tools let scientists leap-frog slow and painstaking parts of the scientific pipeline but can still require many months of lab work to verify results. The idea of an AI scientist is to automate that work too.

AI scientists sit in a layer above those human-made tools and call those tools as needed, says Rowstron. “But there’s a point in time —and I don’t think it’s a decade away —where that AI scientist layer says, ‘I need a tool and it doesn’t exist,’ and it will actually create an AlphaFold kind of tool just on the way to figuring out how to solve another problem. That whole bottom zone will just be automated.”

That’s still some way off, he says. All the projects ARIA is now funding involve systems that call existing tools rather than spin up new ones.

There are also unsolved problems with agentic systems in general, that limits how long they can run by themselves without going off track or making errors. For example, a study, titled “Why LLMs aren’t scientists yet”, posted online last week by researchers at Lossfunk, an AI lab based in India, reports that in an experiment to get LLM agents to run a scientific workflow to completion, the system failed 3 out of 4 times. According to the researchers, the reasons that the LLMs broke down included changing the initial specification and “overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures.”

“Obviously, at the moment these tools are still fairly early in their cycle and these things might plateau,” says Rowstron. “I&#39;m not expecting them to win a Nobel Prize.”

“But there is a world where some of these tools will force us to operate so much quicker. And if we end up in that world, it’s super important for us to be ready.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system.

Using Aadhaar as the bedrock, Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society, covering government services, banking, and health care. They offer convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. Read our profile to learn about what he’s set his sights on next.

Many Americans agree that it’s acceptable to screen embryos for severe genetic diseases. Far fewer say it’s okay to test for characteristics related to a future child’s appearance, behavior, or intelligence. But a few startups are now advertising what they claim is a way to do just that.

This new kind of testing—which can cost up to $50,000—is incredibly controversial. Nevertheless, the practice has grown popular in Silicon Valley, and it’s becoming more widely available to everyone. Read the full story.

On the outskirts of Charlottesville, Virginia, a new kind of sugar factory is taking shape. The facility is being developed by a startup called Bonumose. It uses a processed corn product called maltodextrin that is found in many junk foods and is calorically similar to table sugar (sucrose).

But for Bonumose, maltodextrin isn’t an ingredient—it’s a raw material. When it’s poured into the company’s bioreactors, what emerges is tagatose. Found naturally in small concentrations in fruit, some grains, and milk, it is nearly as sweet as sucrose but apparently with only around half the calories, and wider health benefits.

Bonumose’s process originated in a company spun out of the Virginia Tech lab of Yi-Heng “Percival” Zhang. When MIT Technology Review spoke to Zhang, he was sitting alone in an empty lab in Tianjin, China, after serving a two-year sentence of supervised release in Virginia for conspiracy to defraud the US government, making false statements, and obstruction of justice. If sugar is the new oil, the global battle to control it has already begun. Read the full story.

Just before Christmas the Trump administration dramatically escalated its war on digital rights by banning five people from entering the US. One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations. Ballon told us that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. But their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. Read the full story.

Chatbots are skilled at crafting sophisticated dialogue and mimicking empathetic behavior. They never get tired of chatting. It’s no wonder, then, that so many people now use them for companionship—forging friendships or even romantic relationships. 72% of US teenagers have used AI for companionship, according to a study from the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But while chatbots can provide much-needed emotional support and guidance for some people, they can exacerbate underlying problems in others—especially vulnerable people or those with mental health issues.

Although some early attempts to regulate this space are underway, AI companionship is going nowhere.

It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Read our story to learn more about why.

Gavesh’s journey started, seemingly innocently, with a job ad on Facebook promising work he desperately needed.

Instead, he found himself trafficked into a business commonly known as “pig butchering”—a form of fraud in which scammers form close relationships with targets online and extract money from them. The Chinese crime syndicates behind the scams have netted billions of dollars, and they have used violence and coercion to force their workers, many of them trafficked like Gavesh, to carry out the frauds from large compounds, several of which operate openly in the quasi-lawless borderlands of Myanmar.

Big Tech may hold the key to breaking up the scam syndicates—if these companies can be persuaded or compelled to act. Read the full story.

What’s holding enterprises back is the surrounding infrastructure: Limited data accessibility, rigid integration, and fragile deployment pathways prevent AI initiatives from scaling beyond early LLM and RAG experiments. In response, enterprises are moving toward composable and sovereign AI architectures that lower costs, preserve data ownership, and adapt to the rapid, unpredictable evolution of AI—a shift IDC expects 75% of global businesses to make by 2027.

AI pilots almost always work, and that’s the problem. Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.

“PoCs live inside a safe bubble” observes Cristopher Kuehl, chief data officer at Continent 8 Technologies. Data is carefully curated, integrations are few, and the work is often handled by the most senior and motivated teams.

The result, according to Gerry Murray, research director at IDC, is not so much pilot failure as structural mis-design: Many AI initiatives are effectively “set up for failure from the start.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was early evening in Berlin, just a day before Christmas Eve, when Josephine Ballon got an unexpected email from US Customs and Border Protection. The status of her ability to travel to the United States had changed—she’d no longer be able to enter the country.

At first, she couldn’t find any information online as to why, though she had her suspicions. She was one of the directors of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. As the organization has become a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, it has increasingly found itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

It was only later that she saw what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had posted on X:

For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.Today, @StateDept will take steps toâ€¦

Rubio was promoting a conspiracy theory about what he has called the “censorship-industrial complex,” which alleges widespread collusion between the US government, tech companies, and civil society organizations to silence conservative voices—the very conspiracy theory HateAid has recently been caught up in.

Then Undersecretary of State Sarah B. Rogers posted on X the names of the people targeted by travel bans. The list included Ballon, as well as her HateAid co-director, Anna Lena von Hodenberg. Also named were three others doing similar or related work: former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who had helped author Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA); Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which documents hate speech on social media platforms; and Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, which provides risk ratings warning advertisers about placing ads on websites promoting hate speech and disinformation.

It was an escalation in the Trump administration’s war on digital rights—fought in the name of free speech. But EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject the accusations of censorship. Ballon, von Hodenberg, and some of their clients tell me that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. And their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. They almost certainly won’t be the last people targeted in this way.

Ballon was the one to tell von Hodenberg that both their names were on the list. “We kind of felt a chill in our bones,” von Hodenberg told me when I caught up with the pair in early January.

But she added that they also quickly realized, “Okay, it’s the old playbook to silence us.” So they got to work—starting with challenging the narrative the US government was pushing about them.

Within a few hours, Ballon and von Hodenberg had issued a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations: “We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they wrote. “We demand a clear signal from the German government and the European Commission that this is unacceptable. Otherwise, no civil society organisation, no politician, no researcher, and certainly no individual will dare to denounce abuses by US tech companies in the future.”

Those signals came swiftly. On X, Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, called the entry bans “not acceptable,” adding that “the DSA was democratically adopted by the EU, for the EU—it does not have extraterritorial effect.” Also on X, French president Emmanuel Macron wrote that “these measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.” The European Commission issued a statement that it “strongly condemns” the Trump administration’s actions and reaffirmed its “sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values.”

Ahmed, Melford, Breton, and their respective organizations also made their own statements denouncing the entry bans. Ahmed, the only one of the five based in the United States, also successfully filed suit to preempt any attempts to detain him, which the State Department had indicated it would consider doing.

But alongside the statements of solidarity, Ballon and von Hodenberg said, they also received more practical advice: Assume the travel ban was just the start and that more consequences could be coming. Service providers might preemptively revoke access to their online accounts; banks might restrict their access to money or the global payment system; they might see malicious attempts to get hold of their personal data or that of their clients. Perhaps, allies told them, they should even consider moving their money into friends’ accounts or keeping cash on hand so that they could pay their team’s salaries—and buy their families’ groceries.

These warnings felt particularly urgent given that just days before, the Trump administration had sanctioned two International Criminal Court judges for “illegitimate targeting of Israel.” As a result, they had lost access to many American tech platforms, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Gmail.

“If Microsoft does that to someone who is a lot more important than we are,” Ballon told me, “they will not even blink to shut down the email accounts from some random human rights organization in Germany.”

“We have now this dark cloud over us that any minute, something can happen,” von Hodenberg added. “We’re running against time to take the appropriate measures.”

Founded in 2018 to support people experiencing digital violence, HateAid has since evolved to defend digital rights more broadly. It provides ways for people to report illegal online content and offers victims advice, digital security, emotional support, and help with evidence preservation. It also educates German police, prosecutors, and politicians about how to handle online hate crimes.

Once the group is contacted for help, and if its lawyers determine that the type of harassment has likely violated the law, the organization connects victims with legal counsel who can help them file civil and criminal lawsuits against perpetrators, and if necessary, helps finance the cases. (HateAid itself does not file cases against individuals.) Ballon and von Hodenberg estimate that HateAid has worked with around 7,500 victims and helped them file 700 criminal cases and 300 civil cases, mostly against individual offenders.

For 23-year-old German law student and outspoken political activist Theresia Crone, HateAid’s support has meant that she has been able to regain some sense of agency in her life, both on and offline. She had reached out after she discovered entire online forums dedicated to making deepfakes of her. Without HateAid, she told me, “I would have had to either put my faith into the police and the public prosecutor to prosecute this properly, or I would have had to foot the bill of an attorney myself”—a huge financial burden for “a student with basically no fixed income.”

In addition, working alone would have been retraumatizing: “I would have had to document everything by myself,” she said—meaning “I would have had to see all of these pictures again and again.”

“The internet is a lawless place,” Ballon told me when we first spoke, back in mid-December, a few weeks before the travel ban was announced. In a conference room at the HateAid office in Berlin, she said there are many cases that “cannot even be prosecuted, because no perpetrator is identified.” That’s why the nonprofit also advocates for better laws and regulations governing technology companies in Germany and across the European Union.

On occasion, they have also engaged in strategic litigation against the platforms themselves. In 2023, for example, HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students sued X for failing to enforce its terms of service against posts that were antisemitic or that denied the Holocaust, which is illegal in Germany.

This almost certainly put the organization in the crosshairs of X owner Elon Musk; it also made HateAid a frequent target of Germany’s far right party, the Alternative für Deutschland, which Musk has called “the only hope for Germany.” (X did not respond to a request to comment on this lawsuit.)

For better and worse, HateAid’s profile grew further when it took on another critical job in online safety. In June 2024, it was named as a trusted flagger organization under the Digital Services Act, a 2022 EU law that requires social media companies to remove certain content (including hate speech and violence) that violates national laws, and to provide more transparency to the public, in part by allowing more appeals on platforms’ moderation decisions.

Trusted flaggers are entities designated by individual EU countries to point out illegal content, and they are a key part of DSA enforcement. While anyone can report such content, trusted flaggers’ reports are prioritized and legally require a response from the platforms.

The Trump administration has loudly argued that the trusted flagger program and the DSA more broadly are examples of censorship that disproportionately affect voices on the right and American technology companies, like X.

When we first spoke in December, Ballon said these claims of censorship simply don’t hold water: “We don’t delete content, and we also don’t, like, flag content publicly for everyone to see and to shame people. The only thing that we do: We use the same notification channels that everyone can use, and the only thing that is in the Digital Services Act is that platforms should prioritize our reporting.” Then it is on the platforms to decide what to do.

Nevertheless, the idea that HateAid and like-minded organizations are censoring the right has become a powerful conspiracy theory with real-world consequences. (Last year, MIT Technology Review covered the closure of a small State Department office following allegations that it had conducted “censorship,” as well as an unusual attempt by State leadership to access internal records related to supposed censorship—including information about two of the people who have now been banned, Medford and Ahmed, and both of their organizations.)

HateAid saw a fresh wave of harassment starting last February, when 60 Minutes aired a documentary on hate speech laws in Germany; it featured a quote from Ballon that “free speech needs boundaries,” which, she added, “are part of our constitution.” The interview happened to air just days before Vice President JD Vance attended the Munich Security Conference; there he warned that “across Europe, free speech … is in retreat.” This, Ballon told me, led to heightened hostility toward her and her organization.

Fast-forward to July, when a report by Republicans in the US House of Representatives claimed that the DSA “compels censorship and infringes on American free speech.” HateAid was explicitly named in the report.

All of this has made its work “more dangerous,” Ballon told me in December. Before the 60 Minutes interview, “maybe one and a half years ago, as an organization, there were attacks against us, but mostly against our clients, because they were the activists, the journalists, the politicians at the forefront. But now … we see them becoming more personal.”

As a result, over the last year, HateAid has taken more steps to protect its reputation and get ahead of the damaging narratives. Ballon has reported the hate speech targeted at her—“More [complaints] than in all the years I did this job before,” she said—as well as defamation lawsuits on behalf of HateAid.

All these tensions finally came to a head in December. At the start of the month, the European Commission fined X $140 million for DSA violations. This set off yet another round of recriminations about supposed censorship of the right, with Trump calling the fine “a nasty one” and warning: “Europe has to be very careful.”

Just a few weeks later, the day before Christmas Eve, retaliation against individuals finally arrived.

Digital rights groups are pushing back against the Trump administration’s narrow view of what constitutes free speech and censorship.

“What we see from this administration is a conception of freedom of expression that is not a human-rights-based conception where this is an inalienable, indelible right that’s held by every person,” says David Greene, the civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based digital rights group. Rather, he sees an “expectation that… [if] anybody else&#39;s speech is challenged, there&#39;s a good reason for it, but it should never happen to them.”

Since Trump won his second term, social media platforms have walked back their commitments to trust and safety. Meta, for example, ended fact-checking on Facebook and adopted much of the administration’s censorship language, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling the podcaster Joe Rogan that it would “work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” if they are seen as “going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”

And as the recent fines on X show, Musk’s platform has gone even further in flouting European law—and, ultimately, ignoring the user rights that the DSA was written to protect. In perhaps one of the most egregious examples yet, in recent weeks X allowed people to use Grok, its AI generator, to create nonconsensual nude images of women and children, with few limits—and, so far at least, few consequences. (Last week, X released a statement that it would start limiting users&#39; ability to create explicit images with Grok; in response to a number of questions, X representative Rosemarie Esposito pointed me to that statement.)

For Ballon, it makes perfect sense: “You can better make money if you don’t have to implement safety measures and don’t have to invest money in making your platform the safest place,” she told me.

“It goes both ways,” von Hodenberg added. “It’s not only the platforms who profit from the US administration undermining European laws … but also, obviously, the US administration also has a huge interest in not regulating the platforms … because who is amplified right now? It’s the extreme right.”

She believes this explains why HateAid—and Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate and Melford’s Global Disinformation Index, as well as Breton and the DSA—have been targeted: They are working to disrupt this “unholy deal where the platforms profit economically and the US administration is profiting in dividing the European Union,” she said.

The travel restrictions intentionally send a strong message to all groups that work to hold tech companies accountable. “It’s purely vindictive,” Greene says. “It’s designed to punish people from pursuing further work on disinformation or anti-hate work.” (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.)

And ultimately, this has a broad effect on who feels safe enough to participate online.

Ballon pointed to research that shows the “silencing effect” of harassment and hate speech, not only for “those who have been attacked,” but also for those who witness such attacks. This is particularly true for women, who tend to face more online hate that is also more sexualized and violent. It’ll only be worse if groups like HateAid get deplatformed or lose funding.

Von Hodenberg put it more bluntly: “They reclaim freedom of speech for themselves when they want to say whatever they want, but they silence and censor the ones that criticize them.”

Still, the HateAid directors insist they’re not backing down. They say they’re taking “all advice” they have received seriously, especially with regard to “becoming more independent from service providers,” Ballon told me.

“Part of the reason that they don’t like us is because we are strengthening our clients and empowering them,” said von Hodenberg. “We are making sure that they are not succeeding, and not withdrawing from the public debate.”

“So when they think they can silence us by attacking us? That is just a very wrong perception.”

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.

            <h2>Europe’s €307 million AI funding call</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/europes-e307-million-ai-funding-call">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the European Commission announced on 15th of January a €307.3 million funding call for AI and related tech under Horizon Europe earlier this year, the press materials presented it as a strategic push toward trustworthy AI and European digital autonomy. The funding targets trustworthy AI, data services, robotics, quantum, photonics, and what Brussels calls “open strategic autonomy.”

Viewed in isolation, the number itself isn’t eye-popping. By global standards, where the private sector alone pours hundreds of billions into AI, €307 million is barely a rounding error. Yet this sum matters less for its scale and more for what it reveals about Europe’s longstanding dilemma: how to balance ambitious tech leadership with a cautious, value-driven regulatory culture.

What the EU has done here is consistent with a long-running pattern. Brussels has been building an AI ecosystem that explicitly prioritises ethics, safety , and strategic autonomy over raw capability. The “Apply AI Strategy,” which this funding supports, is designed to ensure AI systems are trustworthy and aligned with European values.

This contrasts sharply with the Silicon Valley model, where scale, speed , and commercial dominance often trump wider social aims.
There’s value in that distinction. Too much focus on growth alone can produce outcomes that benefit a few platforms while leaving society to manage the fallout from algorithmic bias , misinformation , and opaque decision-making systems.

Europe’s regulatory framework, including the Artificial Intelligence Act, embeds risk-based guardrails that aim to prevent harm without halting innovation entirely.

But here’s the rub: principle without productivity can feel like good intentions in a vacuum.

Three years into the AI revolution, the EU’s cumulative investments from this €307 million pool to broader programs under Horizon Europe reflect ambition on paper. But across hard metrics like proprietary model development, commercial AI exports, and infrastructure scale, Europe still lags the US and China. In 2025, reports noted Europe produced far fewer notable AI models than its global competitors, a symptom of a deeper ecosystem gap.

Investing in trustworthy AI is laudable; it’s also inherently longer-term, often without the immediate returns that lure commercial capital. By contrast, the US innovation model embraces iterative risk and market experimentation, which helps explain its dominance in foundational model research and deployment.

Here, Europe’s regulatory heft of the AI Act and related oversight mechanisms both help and hinder. Responsible frameworks can build trust and alignment with public values, but if they become too cumbersome, they risk slowing the very innovation they are meant to guide. Bosch’s leadership in Europe has cautioned against “regulating itself to death,” arguing that excessive bureaucracy deters research and deployment.

The €307 million funding explicitly aims to strengthen strategic autonomy and the ability of European innovators to develop AI technologies without dependency on external tech giants.

That’s a worthy goal. Yet autonomy is easier to declare than to realise. Achieving it requires not just funding research but building scale, infrastructure, talent, and market pull simultaneously. Europe’s efforts on AI gigafactories and high-performance computing centres signal long-term intent, but critics still see fragmentation in infrastructure and business support.
In other words, strategic autonomy without substantial ecosystem maturity can feel like sovereignty in theory, not practice.

The question isn’t whether Europe should fund AI research. The question is whether Europe can translate normative leadership into technological leadership.

If the goal is to lead in ethical, human-centric AI that serves public interest first, then this funding fits a broader philosophy. If the goal is to rival the scale and velocity of global tech powers, then incremental investments like this, however well-intentioned, are positions in a longer, incomplete race.

The EU’s approach to AI will succeed only if it pairs principled regulation with bold bets on infrastructure, startups and commercial pathways that scale quickly. That won’t happen through selective research grants alone.

Europe can still carve a distinctive niche in global AI. Its regulatory clarity, public-interest focus and collaborative innovation structures give it moral authority and, over time, competitive strength if it can channel them into meaningful technological outcomes.

For now, the €307 million is a marker on a long road, not a finish line. It signals where Brussels stands: committed to values, cautious by design, and eager to shape the trajectory of AI, even if it’s not yet setting the pace.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s decision to introduce advertisements inside ChatGPT for free users and its new $8 “Go” tier is already shaping up to be one of the most consequential pivots in generative AI’s short history. It’s not a simple business tweak. It’s a reframing of where digital intent, attention, and commercial influence intersect in an age where conversations increasingly replace search bars.

Yet, this moment will be remembered not as the day ads arrived in ChatGPT, but as the day two decades of assumptions about search and digital advertising broke open.

Read that again: ads won’t sit beside or above a list of links, as they do on Google. They will appear inside the conversational flow, at the moment a user has just received a helpful answer.

This is not incremental. It’s a new interface for intent.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

For years, OpenAI developed ChatGPT as an ad-free oasis in a web saturated with promotions, pop-ups, and sponsored results. Now it’s embracing the oldest monetization strategy on the internet: advertising.  The company insists ads will be clearly labeled, won’t influence AI responses, and won’t depend on selling individual user data. Ads will appear below answers when relevant, and paid tiers like Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise remain ad-free.

To understand why this matters, you need to see it not as an ad insertion, but as a shift in how commerce enters human intent, at the moment of decision, not distraction.

In a classic Google search, thoughtful queries turn into ranked links and ad slots beside them. In a ChatGPT conversation, a user asks a question, gets an answer, and stays in context; the frame never changes. An ad beneath that response isn’t an interruption; it’s an extension of the thought process. This subtle repositioning changes how brands can engage a user: they’re not chasing clicks after a search, they’re walking up with the answer itself.

That’s a paradigm shift. Brands are no longer competing for top billing on a results page; they are competing to be part of the narrative that unfolds between a question and a resolution. It’s a level of semantic proximity to intent that search ads never capture, because even the best keywords are guesses at nuance. ChatGPT sees nuance first.

Let restaurants, retailers, and SaaS companies imagine that: not just showing an ad after someone searches “best CRM tools,” but appearing contextually right when someone asks “what CRM features matter to small teams.” That changes where conversion flows start.

This isn’t happening. OpenAI’s infrastructure costs are enormous, and its free user base dwarfs its subscriber base. Only a small fraction of ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly active users currently pay. Advertising offers a scalable revenue path that could subsidize free access and help the company balance long-term costs.

It’s striking that OpenAI once positioned ads as a “last resort.” Now they’re a strategic mainstay. That tells you two things: the scale of AI compute bills is real, and the company is trying to find a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on subscription fatigue.

ChatGPT’s value isn’t just utility; it’s credibility, the feeling that the answer isn’t trying to sell you something. Introducing ads atop or below answers may be technically neutral, but perception is sticky. Once a user notices “Sponsored” within the thoughtful flow of a conversation, trust becomes negotiable. Academic research on ads in AI interfaces shows that even labeled ads can reduce perceived trust and make users feel manipulated, especially if they blur with responses.

OpenAI recognizes this. It’s promising to avoid showing ads in sensitive contexts, like health, politics, or personal advice, and won’t target minors. It’s also pledging that ads won’t twist the model’s answers.

Yet trust isn’t a function of code; it’s a feeling users develop over time. One poorly placed ad recommendation, even if accurate, can make people wonder whether the answer was shaped by commercial rather than objective logic.

From a creative standpoint, this is both exciting and fraught. The ads we’ve long tolerated have trained us to think of marketing as interruption: banners, pop-ups, pre-roll videos. ChatGPT’s approach suggests something closer to contextual dialogue, where an ad feels like a part of exploration. The brands that succeed here won’t be the loudest; they’ll be the most relevant, most resonant, and most human. They’ll read like answers, not impositions, because they’re embedded in answers.

That opens a new creative demand: marketers will need to think less about clickbait hooks and more about narrative relevance, how to be helpful within a user’s question, not beside it.

Is this the end of Google? No. Google’s advertising machine is vast, integrated, and highly optimized. Its AI integration in search, including AI summaries, already blends insight with ads in ways that are more sophisticated than many realize.

But the rise of ads in ChatGPT signals that intent has multiple layers now. There’s traditional search intent tied to links and pages, and there’s conversational intent captured in natural language interactions. These layers will coexist, sometimes reinforce, sometimes compete.

Advertisers and creators today often optimize for keywords. Tomorrow, they’ll optimize for conversational moments, the semantic cues that signal purchase interest within a dialogue.

The rollout now is just the beginning. If AI systems evolve into multi-modal, interactive assistants that help people plan trips, make purchases, write essays, plan budgets, and solve problems of every sort, the point at which commerce enters that interaction becomes crucial.

The question is no longer “Will people see our ad?” but “Will they trust our recommendation when it pops up next to an AI answer?”

That’s the real test, and the real frontier.
