            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve ever used a 3D printer, you may recall the wondrous feeling when you first printed something you could have never sculpted or built yourself. Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn’t polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today’s AI coding agents feel much the same way.

Since November, I have used Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI’s Codex in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I’ll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my Apple II Plus when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic’s premium AI plans.

Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people’s code for my needs. Since 1990, I’ve programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.

Claude Code, Codex, and Google’s Gemini CLI, can seemingly perform software miracles on a small scale. They can spit out flashy prototypes of simple applications, user interfaces, and even games, but only as long as they borrow patterns from their training data. Much like a 3D printer, doing production-level work takes far more effort. Creating durable production code, managing a complex project, or crafting something truly novel still requires experience, patience, and skill beyond what today’s AI agents can provide on their own.

And yet these tools have opened a world of creative potential in software that was previously closed to me, and they feel personally empowering. Even with that impression, though, I know these are hobby projects, and the limitations of coding agents lead me to believe that veteran software developers probably shouldn’t fear losing their jobs to these tools any time soon. In fact, they may become busier than ever.

So far, I have created over 50 demo projects in the past two months, fueled in part by a bout of COVID that left me bedridden with a laptop and a generous 2x Claude usage cap that Anthropic put in place during the last few weeks of December. As I typed furiously all day, my wife kept asking me, “Who are you talking to?”

You can see a few of the more interesting results listed on my personal website. Here are 10 interesting things I’ve learned from the process.

Even with the best AI coding agents available today, humans remain essential to the software development process. Experienced human software developers bring judgment, creativity, and domain knowledge that AI models lack. They know how to architect systems for long-term maintainability, how to balance technical debt against feature velocity, and when to push back when requirements don’t make sense.

For hobby projects like mine, I can get away with a lot of sloppiness. But for production work, having someone who understands version control, incremental backups, testing one feature at a time, and debugging complex interactions between systems makes all the difference. Knowing something about how good software development works helps a lot when guiding an AI coding agent—the tool amplifies your existing knowledge rather than replacing it.

As independent AI researcher Simon Willison wrote in a post distinguishing serious AI-assisted development from casual “vibe coding,” “AI tools amplify existing expertise. The more skills and experience you have as a software engineer the faster and better the results you can get from working with LLMs and coding agents.”

With AI assistance, you don’t have to remember how to do everything. You just need to know what you want to do.

So I like to remind myself that coding agents are software tools best used to enact human ideas, not autonomous coding employees. They are not people (and not people replacements) no matter how the companies behind them might market them.

If you think about it, everything you do on a computer was once a manual process. Programming a computer like the ENIAC involved literally making physical bits (connections) with wire on a plugboard. The history of programming has been one of increasing automation, so even though this AI-assisted leap is somewhat startling, one could think of these tools as an advancement similar to the advent of high-level languages, automated compilers and debugger tools, or GUI-based IDEs. They can automate many tasks, but managing the overarching project scope still falls to the person telling the tool what to do.

And they can have rapidly compounding benefits. I’ve now used AI tools to write better tools—such as changing the source of an emulator so a coding agent can use it directly—and those improved tools are already having ripple effects. But a human must be in the loop for the best execution of my vision. This approach has kept me very busy, and contrary to some prevailing fears about people becoming dumber due to AI, I have learned many new things along the way.

Like all AI models based on the Transformer architecture, the large language models (LLMs) that underpin today’s coding agents have a significant limitation: They can only reliably apply knowledge gleaned from training data, and they have a limited ability to generalize that knowledge to novel domains not represented in that data.

What is training data? In this case, when building coding-flavored LLMs, AI companies download millions of examples of software code from sources like GitHub and use them to make the AI models. Companies later specialize them for coding through fine-tuning processes.

The ability of AI agents to use trial and error—attempting something and then trying again—helps mitigate the brittleness of LLMs somewhat. But it’s not perfect, and it can be frustrating to see a coding agent spin its wheels trying and failing at a task repeatedly, either because it doesn’t know how to do it or because it previously learned how to solve a problem but then forgot because the context window got compacted (more on that here).

To get around this, it helps to have the AI model take copious notes as it goes along about how it solved certain problems so that future instances of the agent can learn from them again. You also want to set ground rules in the claude.md file that the agent reads when it begins its session.

This brittleness means that coding agents are almost frighteningly good at what they’ve been trained and fine-tuned on—modern programming languages, JavaScript, HTML, and similar well-represented technologies—and generally terrible at tasks on which they have not been deeply trained, such as 6502 Assembly or programming an Atari 800 game with authentic-looking character graphics.

It took me five minutes to make a nice HTML5 demo with Claude but a week of torturous trial and error, plus actual systematic design on my part, to make a similar demo of an Atari 800 game. To do so, I had to use Claude Code to invent several tools, like command-line emulators and MCP servers, that allow it to peek into the operation of the Atari 800’s memory and chipset to even begin to make it happen.

Due to what might poetically be called “preconceived notions” baked into a coding model’s neural network (more technically, statistical semantic associations), it can be difficult to get AI agents to create truly novel things, even if you carefully spell out what you want.

For example, I spent four days trying to get Claude Code to create an Atari 800 version of my HTML game Violent Checkers, but it had trouble because in the game’s design, the squares on the checkerboard don’t matter beyond their starting positions. No matter how many times I told the agent (and made notes in my Claude project files), it would come back to trying to center the pieces to the squares, snap them within squares, or use the squares as a logical basis of the game’s calculations when they should really just form a background image.

To get around this in the Atari 800 version, I started over and told Claude that I was creating a game with a UFO (instead of a circular checker piece) flying over a field of adjacent squares—never once mentioning the words “checker,” “checkerboard,” or “checkers.” With that approach, I got the results I wanted.

Why does this matter? Because with LLMs, context is everything, and in language, context changes meaning. Take the word “bank” and add the words “river” or “central” in front of it, and see how the meaning changes. In a way, words act as addresses that unlock the semantic relationships encoded in a neural network. So if you put “checkerboard” and “game” in the context, the model’s self-attention process links up a massive web of semantic associations about how checkers games should work, and that semantic baggage throws things off.

A couple of tricks can help AI coders navigate around these limitations. First, avoid contaminating the context with irrelevant information. Second, when the agent gets stuck, try this prompt: “What information do you need that would let you implement this perfectly right now? What tools are available to you that you could use to discover that information systematically without guessing?” This forces the agent to identify (semantically link up) its own knowledge gaps, spelled out in the context window and subject to future action, instead of flailing around blindly.

The first 90 percent of an AI coding project comes in fast and amazes you. The last 10 percent involves tediously filling in the details through back-and-forth trial-and-error conversation with the agent. Tasks that require deeper insight or understanding than what the agent can provide still require humans to make the connections and guide it in the right direction. The limitations we discussed above can also cause your project to hit a brick wall.

From what I have observed over the years, larger LLMs can potentially make deeper contextual connections than smaller ones. They have more parameters (encoded data points), and those parameters are linked in more multidimensional ways, so they tend to have a deeper map of semantic relationships. As deep as those go, it seems that human brains still have an even deeper grasp of semantic connections and can make wild semantic jumps that LLMs tend not to.

Creativity, in this sense, may be when you jump from, say, basketball to how bubbles form in soap film and somehow make a useful connection that leads to a breakthrough. Instead, LLMs tend to follow conventional semantic paths that are more conservative and entirely guided by mapped-out relationships from the training data. That limits their creative potential unless the prompter unlocks it by guiding the LLM to make novel semantic connections. That takes skill and creativity on the part of the operator, which once again shows the role of LLMs as tools used by humans rather than independent thinking machines.

While creating software with AI coding tools, the joy of experiencing novelty makes you want to keep adding interesting new features rather than fixing bugs or perfecting existing systems. And Claude (or Codex) is happy to oblige, churning away at new ideas that are easy to sketch out in a quick and pleasing demo (the 90 percent problem again) rather than polishing the code.

Fixing bugs can also create bugs elsewhere. This is not new to coding agents—it’s a time-honored problem in software development. But agents supercharge this phenomenon because they can barrel through your code and make sweeping changes in pursuit of narrow-minded goals that affect lots of working systems. We’ve already talked about the importance of having a good architecture guided by the human mind behind the wheel above, and that comes into play here.

Given the limitations I’ve described above, it’s very clear that an AI model with general intelligence—what people usually call artificial general intelligence (AGI)—is still not here. AGI would hypothetically be able to navigate around baked-in stereotype associations and not have to rely on explicit training or fine-tuning on many examples to get things right. AI companies will probably need a different architecture in the future.

I’m speculating, but AGI would likely need to learn permanently on the fly—as in modify its own neural network weights—instead of relying on what is called “in-context learning,” which only persists until the context fills up and gets compacted or wiped out.

In other words, you could teach a true AGI system how to do something by explanation or let it learn by doing, noting successes, and having those lessons permanently stick, no matter what is in the context window. Today’s coding agents can’t do that—they forget lessons from earlier in a long session or between sessions unless you manually document everything for them. My favorite trick is instructing them to write a long, detailed report on what happened when a bug is fixed. That way, you can point to the hard-earned solution the next time the amnestic AI model makes the same mistake.

While using Claude Code for a while, it’s easy to take for granted that you suddenly have the power to create software without knowing certain programming languages. This is amazing at first, but you can quickly become frustrated that what is conventionally a very fast development process isn’t fast enough. Impatience at the coding machine sets in, and you start wanting more.

But even if you do know the programming languages being used, you don’t get a free pass. You still need to make key decisions about how the project will unfold. And when the agent gets stuck or makes a mess of things, your programming knowledge becomes essential for diagnosing what went wrong and steering it back on course.

After guiding way too many hobby projects through Claude Code over the past two months, I’m starting to think that most people won’t become unemployed due to AI—they will become busier than ever. Power tools allow more work to be done in less time, and the economy will demand more productivity to match.

It’s almost too easy to make new software, in fact, and that can be exhausting. One project idea would lead to another, and I was soon spending eight hours a day during my winter vacation shepherding about 15 Claude Code projects at once. That’s too much split attention for good results, but the novelty of seeing my ideas come to life was addictive. In addition to the game ideas I’ve mentioned here, I made tools that scrape and search my past articles, a graphical MUD based on ZZT, a new type of MUSH (text game) that uses AI-generated rooms, a new type of Telnet display proxy, and a Claude Code client for the Apple II (more on that soon). I also put two AI-enabled emulators for Apple II and Atari 800 on GitHub. Phew.

Consider the advent of the steam shovel, which allowed humans to dig holes faster than a team using hand shovels. It made existing projects faster and new projects possible. But think about the human operator of the steam shovel. Suddenly, we had a tireless tool that could work 24 hours a day if fueled up and maintained properly, while the human piloting it would need to eat, sleep, and rest.

In fact, we may end up needing new protections for human knowledge workers using these tireless information engines to implement their ideas, much as unions rose as a response to industrial production lines over 100 years ago. Humans need rest, even when machines don’t.

Will an AI system ever replace the human role here? Even if AI coding agents could eventually work fully autonomously, I don’t think they’ll replace humans entirely because there will still be people who want to get things done, and new AI power tools will emerge to help them do it.

AI coding tools can turn what was once a year-long personal project into a five-minute session. I fed Claude Code a photo of a two-player Tetris game I sketched in a notebook back in 2008, and it produced a working prototype in minutes (prompt: “create a fully-featured web game with sound effects based on this diagram”). That’s wild, and even though the results are imperfect, it’s a bit frightening to comprehend what kind of sea change in software development this might entail.

Since early December, I’ve been posting some of my more amusing experimental AI-coded projects to Bluesky for people to try out, but I discovered I needed to deliberately slow down with updates because they came too fast for people to absorb (and too fast for me to fully test). I’ve also received comments like “I’m worried you’re using AI, you’re making games too fast” and so on.

Regardless of my own habits, the flow of new software will not slow down. There will soon be a seemingly endless supply of AI-augmented media (games, movies, images, books), and that’s a problem we’ll have to figure out how to deal with. These products won’t all be “AI slop,” either; some will be done very well, and the acceleration in production times due to these new power tools will balloon the quantity beyond anything we’ve seen.

Social media tends to prime people to believe that AI is all good or all bad, but that kind of black-and-white thinking may be the easy way out. You’ll have no cognitive dissonance, but you’ll miss a far richer third option: seeing these tools as imperfect and deserving of critique but also as useful and empowering when they bring your ideas to life.

AI agents should be considered tools, not entities or employees, and they should be amplifiers of human ideas. My game-in-progress Card Miner is entirely my own high-level creative design work, but the AI model handled the low-level code. I am still proud of it as an expression of my personal ideas, and it would not exist without AI coding agents.

For now, at least, coding agents remain very much tools in the hands of people who want to build things. The question is whether humans will learn to wield these new tools effectively to empower themselves. Based on two months of intensive experimentation, I’d say the answer is a qualified yes, with plenty of caveats.

We also have social issues to face: Professional developers already use these tools, and with the prevailing stigma against AI tools in some online communities, many software developers and the platforms that host their work will face difficult decisions.

Ultimately, I don’t think AI tools will make human software designers obsolete. Instead, they may well help those designers become more capable. This isn’t new, of course; tools of every kind have been serving this role since long before the dawn of recorded history. The best tools amplify human capability while keeping a person behind the wheel. The 3D printer analogy holds: amazing fast results are possible, but mastery still takes time, skill, and a lot of patience with the machine.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The global cost of greenhouse gas emissions is nearly double what scientists previously thought, according to a study published Thursday by researchers at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment—a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change—has included damages to the ocean. Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance.

“For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”

The social cost of carbon is an accounting method for working out the monetary cost of each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. “[It] is one of the most efficient tools we have for internalizing climate damages into economic decision-making,” said Amy Campbell, a United Nations climate advisor and former British government COP negotiator.

Calculations have historically been used by international organizations and state departments like the US Environmental Protection Agency to assess policy proposals—though a 2025 White House memo from the Trump administration instructed federal agencies to ignore the data during cost-benefit analyses unless required by law.

“It becomes politically contentious when deciding whose damages are counted, which sectors are included and most importantly how future and retrospective harms are valued,” Campbell said.

Excluding ocean harm, the social cost of carbon is $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. This increases to $97.20 per ton when the ocean, which covers 70 percent of the planet, is included. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were estimated to be 41.6 billion tons, making the 91 percent cost increase significant.

Using greenhouse gas emission predictions, the report estimates the annual damages to traditional markets alone will be $1.66 trillion by 2100.

The study, which began in 2021, brought together scientists from multiple disciplines: Fisheries experts, coral reef researchers, biologists and climate economists. They assessed downstream climate change costs across four key sectors—corals, mangroves, fisheries, and seaports—measuring everything from straightforward market loss of reduced fisheries and marine trade to reductions in ocean-based recreational industries.

Researchers also placed a monetary figure on what economists call non-use values. “Something has value because it makes the world feel more livable, meaningful, or worth protecting, even if we never directly use it,” said Bastien-Olvera, referencing the fiscal merit of ecosystem enjoyment and the cultural loss caused by climate change. “Most people will never visit a coral reef during a full-moon spawning event, or see a deep-sea jellyfish glowing in total darkness. But many still care deeply that these things exist.”

Island economies, which rely more on seafood for nutrition, will face disproportionate financial and health impacts from ocean warming and acidification, the study said. “The countries that have the most responsibility for causing climate change and the most capacity to fix it are not generally the same countries that will experience the largest or most near-term damages,” said Kate Ricke, co-author and climate professor at UCSD’s School of Global Policy and Strategy. Including ocean data in social cost of carbon assessments reveals increased consequences for morbidity and mortality in low-income countries facing increased nutrition deficiency.

Despite the scale of the scientific discovery, Bastien-Olvera and Ricke are optimistic this data will be a wake-up call for international decision-making. “I hope that the high value of ‘blueSCC’ can motivate further investment in adaptation and resilience for ocean systems,” said Ricke, using the term of the ocean-based social cost of carbon and referencing the opportunities to invest in coral reef and mangrove restoration projects.

Meanwhile, Bastien-Olvera believes centering the framework on oceans also recognizes the longstanding conservation approaches of coastal communities, ocean scientists and Indigenous peoples. “For a long time, climate economics treated the ocean values as if it were worth zero,” he said. “This is a first step toward finally acknowledging how wrong that was.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tencia Benavidez, a Supernatural user who lives in New Mexico, started her VR workouts during the Covid pandemic. She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches.

“They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There’s just something really special about those coaches.”

Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commission tried to block Meta from purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.

“Meta fought the government to buy this thing,” Benavidez says. “All that just for them to shut it down? What was the point?”

I reached out to Meta and Supernatural, and neither responded to my requests for comment.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Meta has laid off more than 1,000 people across its VR and metaverse efforts. The move comes after years of the company hemorrhaging billions of dollars on its metaverse products. In addition to laying off most of the staff at Supernatural, Meta has shut down three internal VR studios that made games like Resident Evil 4 and Deadpool VR.

“If it was a bottom-line thing, I think they could have charged more money,” Goff Johnson says about Supernatural. “I think people would have paid for it. This just seems unnecessarily heartless.”

There is a split in the community about who will stay and continue to pay the subscription fee and who will leave. Supernatural has more than 3,000 lessons available in the service, so while new content won’t be added, some feel there is plenty of content left in the library. Other users worry about how Supernatural will continue to license music from big-name bands.

“Supernatural is amazing, but I am canceling it because of this,” Chip told me. “The library is large, so there’s enough to keep you busy, but not for the same price.”

There are other VR workout experiences like FitXR or even the VR staple Beat Saber, which Supernatural cribs a lot of design concepts from. Still, they don’t hit the same bar for many of the Supernatural faithful.

“I’m going to stick it out until they turn the lights out on us,” says Stefanie Wong, a Bay Area accountant who has used Supernatural since shortly after the pandemic and has organized and attended meetup events. “It’s not the app. It’s the community, and it’s the coaches that we really, really care about.”

I tried out Supernatural’s Together feature on Wednesday, the day after the layoffs. It’s where I met Chip and Alisa. When we could stop to catch our breath, we talked about the changes coming to the service. They had played through previous sessions hosted by Jane Fonda or playlists with a mix of music that would change regularly. This one was an artist series featuring entirely Imagine Dragons songs.

In the session, as we punched blocks while being serenaded by this shirtless dude crooning, recorded narrations from Supernatural coach Dwana Olsen chimed in to hype us up.

“Take advantage of these moments,” Olsen said as we punched away. “Use these movements to remind you of how much awesome life you have yet to live.”

Frankly, it was downright invigorating. And bittersweet. We ended another round, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Chip, Alisa, and I high-fived like crazy and readied for another round.

“Beautiful,” Alisa said. “It’s just beautiful, isn’t it?”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/managers-on-alert-for-launch-fever-as-pressure-builds-for-nasas-moon-mission/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida’s Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.

Riding atop one of NASA’s diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world’s heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.

The rollout marks a major step for NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.

The flight will culminate with a scorching 25,000 mph (40,000 km/h) reentry over the Pacific Ocean. The four Artemis II astronauts—NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen—will become the fastest humans in history, edging out a speed record set during the Apollo era of lunar exploration.

The journey for the fully assembled Moon rocket will begin early Saturday at a slower pace. After leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building, the moving 11 million pound structure will head east, then make a left turn before climbing the ramp to Pad 39B overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

“We will be at a cruising speed of under one mile per hour,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s launch director for the Artemis II mission. “It’ll be a little slower around the turns and up the hill.”

The crawler carrying the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft was built 60 years ago to haul NASA’s Saturn V rockets, then kept around for the Space Shuttle Program. Now, the vehicle is back to its original purpose of positioning Moon-bound rockets on their launch pads.

“These are the kinds of days that we live for when you do the kind of work that we do,” said John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Mission Management Team for the Artemis II mission. “The rocket and the spacecraft, Orion Integrity, are getting ready to roll to the pad … It really doesn’t get much better than this, and we’re making history.”

You can watch live views of the rollout in this YouTube stream provided by NASA.

Artemis II is the first crew flight of NASA’s Artemis program, an initiative named for the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. NASA named the program Artemis in 2019, but some of the building blocks have been around for 20 years.

NASA selected Orion contractor Lockheed Martin to oversee the development of a deep space capsule in 2006 as part of the George W. Bush administration’s soon-to-be canceled Constellation program. In 2011, a political bargain between the Obama administration and Congress revived the Orion program and kicked off development of the Space Launch System. The announcement of the Artemis program in 2019 leaned on work already underway on Orion and the SLS rocket as the centerpieces of an architecture to return US astronauts to the Moon.

Tens of billions of dollars later, everything is finally coming together for the final, all-important milestone in developing the vehicles for transporting crews between the Earth and the Moon. A human-rated lunar lander and spacesuits tailored for Moonwalking astronauts are still a few years away from readiness. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin for landers, and with Axiom Space for suits.

A successful Artemis II mission would demonstrate to NASA’s managers and engineers that the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket fulfill their roles in the Artemis architecture. NASA is expected to rely on the SLS rocket, which costs more than $2 billion per flight and is expendable by design, for several more missions until commercial alternatives are available.

America’s return to the Moon now has a geopolitical imperative. China is working to land its own astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and US officials want to beat the Chinese to the Moon for the motivation of national prestige and the material benefits of accessing lunar resources, among other reasons. For now, budget-writing lawmakers in Congress and President Donald Trump’s new NASA chief, Jared Isaacman, agree the existing SLS/Orion architecture, despite its cost and shortcomings, offers the surest opportunity to beat the Chinese space program to a crewed lunar landing.

Then, if all goes according to plan, NASA can turn to cheaper (and in one case, more capable) rockets to help the government afford the expenditure required to construct a Moon base.

“Putting crew on the rocket and taking the crew around the Moon, this is going be our first step toward a sustained lunar presence,” Honeycutt said. “It’s 10 days [and] four astronauts going farther from Earth than any other human has ever traveled. We’ll be validating the Orion spacecraft’s life support, navigation and crew systems in the really harsh environments of deep space, and that’s going to pave the way for future landings.”

There is still much work ahead before NASA can clear Artemis II for launch. At the launch pad, technicians will complete final checkouts and closeouts before NASA’s launch team gathers in early February for a critical practice countdown. During this countdown, called a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), Blackwell-Thompson and her team will oversee the loading of the SLS rocket’s core stage and upper stage with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.

The cryogenic fluids, particularly liquid hydrogen, gave fits to the Artemis launch team as NASA prepared to launch the Artemis I mission—without astronauts—on the SLS rocket’s first test flight in 2022. Engineers resolved the issues and successfully launched the Artemis I mission in November 2022, and officials will apply the lessons for the Artemis II countdown.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “And the things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to do for the Artemis II vehicle.”

Assuming the countdown rehearsal goes according to plan, NASA could be in a position to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as February 6. But the schedule for February 6 is tight, with no margin for error. Officials typically have about five days per month when they can launch Artemis II, when the Moon is in the right position relative to Earth, and the Orion spacecraft can follow the proper trajectory toward reentry and splashdown to limit stress on the capsule’s heat shield.

In February, the available launch dates are February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, with launch windows in the overnight hours in Florida. If the mission isn’t off the ground by February 11, NASA will have to stand down until a new series of launch opportunities beginning March 6. The space agency has posted a document showing all available launch dates and times through the end of April.

NASA’s leaders are eager for Artemis II to fly. NASA is not only racing China, a reality the agency’s former administrator acknowledged during the Biden administration. Now, the Trump administration is pushing NASA to accomplish a human landing on the Moon by the end of his presidential term on January 20, 2029.

One of Honeycutt’s jobs as chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) is ensuring all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed amid the frenzy of final launch preparations. While the hardware for Artemis II is on the move in Florida, the astronauts and flight controllers are wrapping up their final training and simulations at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

“I think I’ve got a good eye for launch fever,” he said Friday.

“As chair of the MMT, I’ve got one job, and it’s the safe return of Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy. I consider that a duty and a trust, and it’s one I intend to see through.”</div>

            <h2>Rackspace customers grapple with “devastating” email hosting price hike</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rackspace’s new pricing for its email hosting services is “devastating,” according to a partner that has been using Rackspace as its email provider since 1999.

In recent weeks, Rackspace updated its email hosting pricing. Its standard plan is now $10 per mailbox per month. Businesses can also pay for the Rackspace Email Plus add-on for an extra $2/mailbox/month (for “file storage, mobile sync, Office-compatible apps, and messaging”), and the Archiving add-on for an extra $6/mailbox/month (for unlimited storage).

As recently as November 2025, Rackspace charged $3/mailbox/month for its Standard plan, and an extra $1/mailbox/month for the Email Plus add-on, and an additional $3/mailbox/month for the Archival add-on, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.

Rackspace’s reseller partners have been especially vocal about the impacts of the new pricing.

In a blog post on Thursday, web hosting service provider and Rackspace reseller Laughing Squid said Rackspace is “increasing our email pricing by an astronomical 706 percent, with only a month-and-a half’s notice.”

Laughing Squid founder Scott Beale told Ars Technica that he received the “devastating” news via email on Wednesday. The last time Rackspace increased Laughing Squid’s email prices was by 55 percent in 2019, he said.

“The price increase has a major impact on the ability to make money due to the fact that email is now our largest expense, and we were only given a month-and-a-half notice,” Beale told Ars.

Online, there are reports of Rackspace partners being quoted email pricing increases of 110 percent to nearly 500 percent. The reports say that the new, higher-per-mailbox quotes don’t include volume pricing discounts. Beale noted that Laughing Squid’s quote doesn’t include discounts that the company previously received.

“We had really good reseller pricing that we negotiated with Rackspace due to the number of mailboxes we had with them and how long we had been a customer. All of that seemed to vanish when they notified us of their new pricing,” he said.

Ars contacted Rackspace asking about the 706 percent price hike that Laughing Squid says it’s facing, why Rackspace decided to increase its prices now, and why it didn’t give its partners more advanced notice. A company spokesperson responded, saying:

Rackspace Email is a reliable and secure business-class email solution for small businesses. To continue delivering the service levels our customers expect, effective March 2026, Rackspace Technology is increasing the price of Rackspace Email. We have a support team available to help our customers to discuss their options.

The spokesperson added that Rackspace’s “mission is to deliver quality, trusted and reliable hosted email solution for businesses.”

Despite Rackspace’s stated commitment to email hosting, the prohibitive pricing seems like a deterrent for a business being viewed as high-effort and low-margin. Email has grown complex over the years, requiring time and expertise for proper management at scale. It’s become simpler, or more lucrative, for some cloud companies to focus on selling their managed services on top of offerings like Microsoft 365—as Rackspace does—or Google Workspace and let the larger companies behind those solutions deal with infrastructure costs and complexities.

Rackspace’s price hike also comes as an AI-driven RAM shortage is impacting the availability and affordability of other computing components, including storage.

With Rackspace, which went public in 2020, also having quit hosting Microsoft Exchange following a costly 2022 ransomware attack, the Texas-headquartered company may be looking to minimize its email hosting duties as much as possible.

Meanwhile, Laughing Squid is increasing prices for Rackspace mailboxes and offering services with a different email provider, PolarisMail, to customers at lower prices. Beale said he has reached out to Rackspace about the new pricing but hasn’t heard back yet.</div>

            <h2>Archaeologists find a supersized medieval shipwreck in Denmark</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/archaeologists-find-a-supersized-medieval-shipwreck-in-denmark/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.

Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.

Most cogs would have been about 15 to 25 meters long and 5 to 8 meters wide, capable of carrying about 200 tons of cargo—big, impressive ships for their time. But Svaelget 2, an absolute unit of a ship, measured about 28 meters from bow to stern, 9 meters wide, and could have carried about 300 tons. Its size alone was a surprise to the archaeologists.

“We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme,” said archaeologist Otto Uldum of Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum, who led the excavation, in a press release.

Medieval Europe’s merchant class was growing in both size and wealth in the early 1400s, and the cog was both a product of that growth and the engine driving it. The mere fact of its existence points to a society that could afford to invest in building big, expensive trading ships (and could confidently expect a return on that investment). And physically, it’s a product of the same trading networks it supplied: while the heavy timbers of its frame were cut locally in the Netherlands, the Pomeranian oak planks of Svaelget 2’s hull came from Poland.

“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” said Uldum. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”

For about 600 years, layers of sand had protected the starboard (right, for you landlubbers) side of the wreck from erosion and decay. Nautical archaeologists usually find only the very bottoms of cogs; the upper structures of the ship—rigging, decks, and castles—quickly decay in the ocean. That means that some of the most innovative parts of the ships’ construction appear only in medieval drawings and descriptions.

But Svaelget 2 offers archaeologists a hands-on look at the real deal, from rigging to the ship’s galley and the stern castle: a tall wooden structure at the back of the ship, where crew and passengers could have sought at least a little shelter from the elements. Medieval drawings and texts describe cogs having high castles at both bow and stern, but archaeologists have never gotten to examine a real one to learn how it’s put together or how it connects with the rest of the ship’s construction.

“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” said Uldum. “[The castle] is a big step forward compared to Viking Age ships, which had only open decks in all kinds of weather.”

Lying on and around the remains of the cog’s decks, Uldum and his colleagues also found stays (ropes that would have held the mast in place) and lines for controlling the ship’s single square sail, along with ropes and chains that would once have secured the merchant vessel’s cargo in the open hold.

The cog would probably have sailed with between 30 and 45 crew members. No remains were found on the wreck, but the lost crew left behind small, tantalizing traces of their lives and their presence. Uldum and his colleagues found combs, shoes, and rosary beads, along with dishes and tableware.

“The sailor brought his comb to keep his hair neat and his rosary to say his prayers,” said Uldum (and one has to picture the sailor’s grandmother beaming proudly at that description). “These personal objects show us that the crew brought everyday items with them. They transferred their life on land to life at sea.”

Life at sea, for the medieval sailors aboard Svaelget 2, would have included at least occasional hot meals, cooked in bronze pots over an open fire in the ship’s galley and eaten on dishes of ceramic and painted wood. Bricks (about 200 of them) and tiles formed a sort of fireplace where the cook could safely build a fire aboard the otherwise very flammable ship.

“It speaks of remarkable comfort and organization on board,” said Uldum. “Now sailors could have hot meals similar to those on land, instead of the dried and cold food that previously dominated life at sea.” Plenty of dried meat and cold biscuits still awaited sailors for the next several centuries, of course, but when weather and time permitted, at least the crew of Svaelget 2 could gather around a hot meal. The galley would have been a relatively new part of shipboard life for sailors in the early 1400s—and it quickly became a vital one.

One thing usually marks the site of a shipwreck, even when everything else has disintegrated into the ocean: ballast stones. When merchant ships were empty, they carried stones in their holds to help keep the ship stable; otherwise, the empty ship would be top-heavy and prone to tipping over, which is usually not ideal. (Modern merchant vessels use water, in special tanks, for ballast.) But Uldum and his colleagues didn’t find ballast stones on Svaelget 2, which means the cog was probably fully laden with cargo when it sank.

But the cargo is also conspicuously absent. Cogs were built to carry bulk goods—things like bricks, grain and other staple foods, fabric, salt, and timber. Those goods would have been stowed in an open hold amidships, secured by ropes and chains (some of which remain on the wreck). But barrels, boards, and bolts of fabric all float. As the ship sank and water washed into the hold, it would have carried away the cargo.

Some of it may have washed up on the shores or even more distant beaches, becoming a windfall for local residents. The rest probably sank to the bottom of the sea, far from the ship and its destination.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Tesla’s “apocalypse-proof” Cybertruck is continuing to experience a near-cataclysmic plunge in sales that seems impossible to recover from.

According to a new analysis of Cox Automotive data by InsideEVs, the unorthodox electric pickup truck suffered the steepest drop in sales by volume of any EV sold in the US in 2025, capping off a disastrous year in which every quarter seemed to bring more record-setting Cybertruck lows.

For context, in 2024 — the first full year of the Cybertruck being on the market — Tesla sold around 39,000 of the notoriously unreliable pickups. That’s a figure that isn’t even in the same planet as CEO Elon Musk’s up-front boast that the automaker would sell up to half a million of these every year.

The year following, any hope that it would be a late-blooming success story went up in smoke like a wrecked EV. A pitiful tally of just 20,200 Cybertrucks were sold in all of 2025, and that shortfall of around 19,000 sales, representing a near 50 percent collapse, is the largest sales drop of an EV on sale in the US, according to InsideEV. (And that’s without getting into how Musk reportedly sold Cybertrucks to his own companies to juice sales figures, so the real picture may be even worse.)

To be fair to the Cybertruck, its first year of sales had some pretty good numbers for what remains a fairly niche market of electric pickups, regardless of the fact that it was still drastically short of Musk’s typically overly-optimistic projections — so it had a higher bar to fall from than most.

Still, the cratering sales didn’t come out of nowhere. Earning a reputation for being unreliable rustbuckets, the Cybertruck has been recalled ten times for issues as serious and embarrassing as its accelerator pedal getting stuck in the down position and losing power while driving. Add to that the recalls for its stainless steel body panels flying off because they were held on with crummy glue — and another glue recall for its lightbar attachments, too — and it becomes unclear whether the trucks which Musk frequently hyped as capable of surviving the post-apocalypse would even be a reliable pick to survive a trip to the Tesla Diner.

It also certainly didn’t help that Musk spent all of last year speed-running becoming one of the most hated men in America with his espousal of far-right politics and his hands-on role in gutting the federal government through his pet project DOGE, tanking Tesla’s reputation with it. And out of all the EV automaker’s cars, the Cybertruck is the one most closely associated with Musk’s personal brand and vision.

Perhaps Musk’s pride in the Cybertruck is why it hasn’t landed on the chopping block yet. As Electrek noted, Ford’s EV pickup, the F-150 Lightning, comfortably outsold the Cybertruck last year — and it got canned for not selling enough.

            <div id="article-text">An Amazon fulfillment center in Texas became a murder scene after a dispute between co-workers spiraled into a shooting that left one man dead and two others implicated in his murder.

The incident unfolded just after 10 p.m. on January 10 at a San Antonio Amazon facility located at U.S. Highway 90 and Loop 1604, local news station WOAI reports. Two Amazon workers, Johnny Bermea II and one unidentified man, had a long running argument stemming from high school and decided to fight each other during a scheduled work break to settle it.

The unknown employee had rallied local friends for backup, unbeknownst to Bermea; one of those friends, David Perez Morales Jr., exited a vehicle and allegedly fired a gun and shortly left the scene with another man, Jamari McKillion, who’s accused of driving the getaway vehicle.

Bermea was injured but stable after the shooting but another Amazon worker, Katrael Delosier, was left dead. Police linked McKillion, who worked at another nearby Amazon facility, to the shooting via video footage, cell phone data, and eyewitness statements, and that led to them fingering Morales as well.

McKillion and Morales are now facing murder charges for the shooting death of Delosier.

This isn’t the first murder at an Amazon warehouse. In June 2022, a man shot and killed a female Amazon worker in a Mississippi warehouse and then fled into Tennessee, where was he was killed in a shootout with Memphis police officers. In a separate incident in South Carolina in December 2022, two Amazon workers got into a dispute that led to one of them allegedly shooting the other and committing murder.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On the campaign trail leading up to his election in 2024, Donald Trump made a plenty of bizarre promises that have fallen by the wayside. Arguably the strangest one he’s still harping about? Greenland — a massive island in the Arctic Ocean, currently a territory of Denmark, that he desperately wants to seize.

Geopolitical analysts and pundits have spilled plenty of ink over the past year trying to come up with some rational explanation for Trump’s obsession with the idea. One of the simplest, the New York Times suggests — yet somehow the most cynical — has to do with the scientific certainty that Greenland’s ice will soon melt away.

From September 2024 to September 2025, Greenland lost a staggering 105 billion metric tons of ice, according to researchers at the Danish Meteorological Institute. Between 1985 and 2022, Greenland’s ice sheet has shrunk by some 2,000 square miles. These trends are sure to continue in the years to come.

Beneath all that ice and permafrost is a veritable treasure trove of minerals like graphite, zinc, and rare earths. Basically, as the climate warms and Greenland’s ice melts, more and more of those minerals will become available for extraction.

In a nakedly empire-building type of way, in other words, Greenland makes perfect sense. The only problem? Publicly, Trump disparages the very notion of climate change — meaning that if really does understand the wealth of resources that the phenomenon is opening up in colder parts of the world, he’s fibbing to his base for jaded political reasons.

“His fixation on Greenland is an admission that climate change is real,” John Conger, an advisor to the Center for Climate and Security told the NYT.

If Trump or his advisors really are intrigued by Greenland because they’re anticipating a thawing world, that puts them in good company with Trump’s longstanding allies in Russia, where the ruling oligarchy is said to be banking on a similar strategy for the country’s immense frozen expanses.

If it sounds convoluted, it’s only because other explanations for Trump’s North Atlantic fixation just don’t add up.

As economic historian and analyst Adam Tooze explains, the US has a long-standing Cold War treaty with Denmark giving the US military carte blanche to do whatever it wants on Greenland’s territory. As such, there’s no national security justification for why the US needs to own Denmark outright.

“If Greenland isn’t currently adequately defended, it might be to do with the fact that America has completely run down multiple military bases it used to maintain on Greenland during the Cold War,” Tooze said on a recent episode of his podcast Ones and Tooze.

Oil — the classic raison d’être for US intervention on foreign soil — also doesn’t apply here. (Nor Venezuela, for that matter.)

In 2021, the governing body of Greenland stopped granting oil exploration licenses, the NYT notes, due to “climate considerations, environmental considerations and economic common sense.” That news came after 50 years of unsuccessful attempts to strike black gold in the icy waters off the island’s coast, meaning oil is a very unlikely motivation.

At the end of the day, we probably won’tknow the administration’s true motivations for Greenland unless they actually pull the trigger — though if Venezuela is any indication, a straight answer is far from guaranteed.

            <div id="article-text">There’s endless debate among cosmologists about what really makes up the emptiness of outer space, though many believe that mysterious stuff that we now call dark matter and dark energy represent a significant portion.

In a new yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper flagged by Live Science, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology in Jodhpur named Muhammad Ghulam Khuwajah Khan proposes an intriguing theory: that space is something akin to a viscous fluid, like a slow-moving honey. If borne out — a significant “if,” to be clear — the model could go a long way to explaining certain discrepancies that have rankled scientists about the universe.

Currently, astronomers generally embrace the Lambda Cold Dark Matter Model — often shortened to the ΛCDM model — to explain mathematically how the Big Bang Theory occurred, how dark matter keeps galaxies together, and how dark energy is driving the expansion of the universe. The energy density of space is known as the cosmological constant, written as the Greek letter Lambda or Λ, and is considered an unchanging quality.

But recent data captured by the The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey in Arizona and the Dark Energy Survey in Chile suggests that scientists may need to update the ΛCDM model of the universe; astronomers picked up discrepancies between telescopic observations and the ΛCDM model that seems to point towards the idea that dark energy, long thought to be an immutable throughout space time, has instead weakened as the universe has accelerated and grown older.

Khan’s theory, an attempt to reconcile this mismatch, posits that we should instead mathematically treat outer space as a viscous, stretchy fluid that can contain a quality he calls “spatial phonons,” or vibrations emitted by atoms — which create waves of tension in space.

The theory is that dark energy pushes space to expand, but these phonons subtly push back, meaning the universe’s expasion isn’t uniform; layering this idea over the dark energy observations picked by DESI resolves the discrepancy noticed by astronomers that deviates from the ΛCDM model.

It’s an intriguing idea that keeps the idea of dark energy as a cosmological constant that pushes the expansion of the universe, while introducing a theoretical wrinkle that can explain weird observations that seem to violate it.

But more data from these dark energy surveys will be needed to see if this theory can hold up or confine this wacky idea to the dustbins of history. We’ll be watching.

            <div id="article-text">Social media algorithms keep us all hopelessly engaged. The data these platforms gather on us enable feeds to become fine-tuned to our exact interests, on top of turning our smartphones into glorified ad delivery devices. All this seems to be reaching its zenith with AI chatbots, which can masquerade as a close friend, therapist, doctor, and any subject matter expert all at once — keeping many users engaged in hours-long talks as they take the AI’s responses as personal gospel.

In sum, the advent of personal digital technologies, and our ensuing addiction to screens, means that nearly every aspect of our being can be codified, and therefore commodified. Now, one historian is calling this new way of extracting money from human beings “human fracking” — a term that aptly conjures the image of something that is wildly destructive and which works mainly by force-feeding.

“Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetizable black gold to the surface,” writes D Graham Burnett, a professor of history at Princeton University, in an essay for The Guardian, “human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.”

According to Burnett, who writes with filmmaker Alyssa Loh and organizer Peter Schmidt, human fracking is a “world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness — which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.” In this empire, we are all “attentional subjects.”

Troves of research has delved into the nefarious effects that this digital war for control over our attention spans has on the brain. Much criticism has been directed towards the innovation of the infinite scroll used in apps, removing a natural stopping point for our minds and preying on our brain’s desire to seek out new information. It gave birth to the phenomenon of “doomscrolling,” and was not the result of an accident, but calculated decision making: an act of human fracking, if you will. Yet more research has uncovered social media’s effects on the brains of children, with a recent study linking screen time on these apps and ADHD. The rapid proliferation of AI-generated slop is almost certainly adding another horrific dimension to this mental health crisis that science is only beginning to sniff at.

How do we even begin to tackle this problem? The answer may not be obvious now, but as Burnett writes, “novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance,” writes Burnett. He notes how environmental politics didn’t exist a hundred years ago, and that it took a vast cultural shift “to establish the physical environment — the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life — as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organize.” If we allow ourselves to be optimistic for a moment, that shift will also come in regards to human fracking.

            <div id="article-text">How’s a literal nuclear bunker hanging off the side of a crumbling cliff face for portent symbols of how our society seems to be teetering on the edge of some imminent catastrophe? Not good enough for you? Well, it’s what we’ve got.

The brick building, located near Tunstall on the East Yorkshire coast in the UK, is thought to have been built way back in 1959 as a lookout post in the event of a nuclear war. But it’s now just days away from falling into the sea, the BBC reports, as coastal erosion eats away at the cliff top it’s lodged in.

The state of the bunker is so precarious that the East Riding of Yorkshire Council has asked locals to stay clear of the area both at the top of the cliff and below the bunker, in case of a collapse.

“We live on one of the most eroded coastlines in Europe and this bunker hasn’t got long left, perhaps just a few days,” Davey Robinson, an amateur historian who is filming the bunker’s final days, told the BBC.

At the time of reporting on Tuesday, Robinson said he and his partner have visited the Tunstall site every morning for the past nine days. “We are posting the footage on our YouTube channel and it’s getting interest from around the world,” Robinson said.

The bunker, officially known as the Tunstall Royal Observer Corps Post, is a relic of Cold War era paranoia. According to Robinson, “it was designed so that people could live inside it and just wait for a nuclear explosion to register and they could tell other people in other bunkers around the country.”

Today, however, “it’s a symbol of erosion in this area.”

To an extent, coastal erosion is a natural and inevitable process, but geologists believe it’s being accelerated by rising sea levels from global warming. As it stands, around 17 percent of the UK’s over 10,000 miles of coastline is being affected by erosion — and it’s being deeply felt in communities like Tunstall.

“This whole area is eroding at a rapid rate and to see an actual physical thing moving it just shows what’s happening really,” Robinson told the BBC.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended this week with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.

As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.

In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.

Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.

Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.

According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.

And this week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.

The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.

Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.

In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.

Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.

That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.

Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.

Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.

“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”

He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.

Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.

Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.

From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.

For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)

But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.

Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.

As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.

In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.

At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.

These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”

Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)

Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.

With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)

With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.

Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/19/rogue-agents-and-shadow-ai-why-vcs-are-betting-big-on-ai-security/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you?

That’s not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors.

“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”

Meftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah.

Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance.

Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.

“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity.

Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.

“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said.

As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.

Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.

Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.

“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat them?”

For his part, Caccia doesn’t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider.

“CrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM. Okta did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images.

The product was envisioned by founder CEO Robhy Bustami, who was raised in a family of obstetricians, including his mother, aunt and uncle. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.

After learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI.

The technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch.

He hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers among high-income nations. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,

Bustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the “cornerstone” of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis.

Bustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome.

“In an environment where disparities in healthcare outcomes are well documented, it was critical to demonstrate consistent performance across patient subgroups, not just in idealized cases,” Bustami continued.

The CEO said it took just under three years to go through the FDA process, including testing and validating the product. The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said.

Now with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies’ next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health.

“We’re positioned to scale both distribution and clinical impact while continuing to deepen the power of our technology,” he said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/sequoia-to-invest-in-anthropic-breaking-vc-taboo-on-backing-rivals-ft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sequoia Capital is reportedly joining a blockbuster funding round for Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, according to the Financial Times. It’s a move sure to turn heads in Silicon Valley.

Why? Because venture capital firms have historically avoided backing competing companies in the same sector, preferring to place their bets on a single winner. Yet here’s Sequoia, already invested in both OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, now throwing its weight behind Anthropic, too.

The timing is particularly surprising given what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said under oath last year. As part of OpenAI’s defense against Musk’s lawsuit, Altman addressed rumors about restrictions in OpenAI’s 2024 funding round. While he denied that OpenAI investors were broadly prohibited from backing rivals, he did acknowledge that investors with ongoing access to OpenAI’s confidential information were told that access would be terminated “if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI’s competitors.” Altman called this “industry standard” protection (which it is) against misuse of competitively-sensitive information.

According to the FT, Sequoia is joining a funding round led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, which are each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is aiming to raise $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation — more than double its $170 billion valuation from just four months ago. The WSJ and Bloomberg had earlier reported the round at $10 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and other investors said to be contributing another $10 billion or more.

The Sequoia connection with Altman runs deep. When Altman dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, Sequoia backed him. He later became a “scout” for Sequoia, introducing the firm to Stripe, which became one of the firm’s most valuable portfolio companies. Sequoia’s new co-leader Alfred Lin and Altman also appear comparatively close. Lin has interviewed Altman numerous times at Sequoia events, and when Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in November 2023, Lin publicly said he’d eagerly back Altman’s “next world-changing company.”

While Sequoia’s investment in xAI might seem to have already contradicted the traditional VC approach of picking winners, that bet is widely viewed as less about backing an OpenAI competitor and more about deepening the firm’s extensive ties to Elon Musk. Sequoia invested in X when Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it, is an investor in SpaceX and The Boring Company, and is a major backer of Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company. Former longtime Sequoia leader Michael Moritz was even an early investor in Musk’s X.com, which became part of PayPal.

Sequoia’s apparent reversal on portfolio conflicts is especially glaring given its historical stance. As we reported in 2020, the firm took the extraordinary step of walking away from its investment in payments company Finix after determining the startup competed with Stripe. Sequoia forfeited its $21 million investment, letting Finix keep the money while giving up its board seat, information rights, and shares, marking the first time in the firm’s history it had severed ties with a newly funded company over a conflict of interest. (Sequoia had led Finix’s $35 million Series B round just months earlier.)

The reported Anthropic investment comes after dramatic leadership changes at Sequoia, where the firm’s global steward, Roelof Botha, was forced aside in a surprise vote this fall just days after sitting down with this editor at TechCrunch Disrupt, with Lin and Pat Grady — who’d led that Finix deal — taking over.

Anthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO that could come as soon as this year. We’ve reached out to Sequoia Capital for comment.

It’s been a minute, folks! As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We’re back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition.

I spent the first week of the year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this last January, it’s worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building.

What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (Zoox, Tensor Auto, Tier IV, and Waymo, which rebranded its Zeekr RT, to name a few), Chinese automakers like Geely and GWM, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls “physical AI.”

The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what’s in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables.

Hyundai had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn’t showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the Atlas humanoid robot, courtesy of its subsidiary Boston Dynamics. There were also innovations that have come out of Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into production this year. It seems everyone was embracing and showcasing robotics, particularly humanoids.

The hype around humanoids, specifically, and physical AI, in general, was palpable. I asked Mobileye co-founder and president Amnon Shashua about this because his company just bought his humanoid robotics startup for $900 million: “What do you say when people tell you humanoid robots are all hype?”

“The internet was also a hype, remember in 2000, the crisis of the internet,” Shashua said. “It did not mean that [the] internet is not a real thing. Hype means that companies are overvalued for a certain period of time, and then they crash. It does not mean that the domain is not real. I believe that the domain of humanoids is real.”

Now onto the other non-CES and more recent news …

President Trump made comments this week at a Detroit Economic Club meeting about welcoming Chinese automakers into the United States that did not sit well with many in the auto industry, according to insiders I have spoken to. Specifically, I have been told the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (the industry lobbying group) is “freaking out,” one DC insider told me.

“If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, I love that,” Trump said, according to reporters in attendance. “Let China come in, let Japan come in.”

A couple of notes. Japanese companies like Toyota are already very much in the United States. The bigger hurdle, beyond protests from within the boardrooms of U.S. automakers, is existing law. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule that restricts the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia. This essentially bans the sale of Chinese vehicles in the country.

Avery Ash, who is CEO of SAFE, a nonpartisan organization focused on securing U.S. energy, critical materials, and supply chains, weighed in about the dangers of allowing Chinese automakers to sell their vehicles in the United States. Side note: Ash was on my podcast, the Autonocast, which touches on some of this subject.

“Welcoming Chinese automakers to build cars here in the U.S. will reverse these hard-won accomplishments and put Americans at risk,” he said. ”We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere — it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure.”

Meanwhile, Canada is opening the door to Chinese automakers. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, Sean O’Kane reports.

Budget carrier Allegiant agreed to buy rival Sun Country Airlines for about $1.5 billion in cash and stock.

Dealerware, which sells software services to automotive OEMs and retailers, was acquired by a group of investors led by Wavecrest Growth Partners and Radian Capital. Automotive Ventures and automotive industry executives David Metter and Devin Daly also participated. The terms were not disclosed.

Long-distance bus and train provider Flix acquired the majority share of European airport transfer-platform Flibco. Luxembourg company SLG will retain some ownership stake in Flibco. Terms weren’t disclosed.

JetZero, the Long Beach, California, startup developing a midsized triangular aircraft designed to save on fuel, raised $175 million in a Series B round led by B Capital, Bloomberg reported.

Joby Aviation, a company developing electric air taxis, reached an agreement to buy a 700,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio, to support its plans to double production to four aircraft per month in 2027.

Luminar has reached a deal to sell its lidar business to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. for just $22 million. If that seems low, you’re right. Luminar’s valuation peaked in 2021 at $11 billion.

Bluspark Global, a New York-based shipping and supply chain software company, didn’t realize its platform was vulnerable and open to anyone on the internet. Here’s how a security researcher (and TechCrunch) got it fixed.

The Federal Trade Commission finalized an order that bans General Motors and its OnStar telematics service from sharing certain consumer data with consumer reporting agencies. Read the full story on what that means.

InDrive, the company that started as a ride-hailing platform that lets users set the price, is diversifying and starting to execute on its “super app” strategy. That means more in-app advertising across its top 20 markets and expanding grocery delivery to Pakistan. Read the full story here.

Motional, the majority Hyundai-owned autonomous vehicle company, has rebooted. When Motional paused its operations last year, I wasn’t sure it was going to survive. Other AV companies with big backers have seen their funding disappear in a blink, so it was certainly plausible. But the company is here and with a new AI-first approach. Before you roll your eyes at that term, take a read of my article, which includes a demo ride and an interview with CEO Laura Major. Then feel free to hit my inbox with your thoughts.

New York governor Kathy Hochul plans to introduce legislation that would effectively legalize robotaxis in the state with the exception of New York City. No details on this yet; I’ve been told it will all be revealed in her executive budget proposal next week. What we do know is the proposal is designed to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.” My article delves deeper into what she shared and gives an update on Waymo’s NYC permit.

The text was forwarded by the White House National Security Council to ambassadors in Washington, and was clearly intended to be widely shared. Here it is:

Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT

One could observe many things about this document. One is the childish grammar, including the strange capitalizations (“Complete and Total Control”). Another is the loose grasp of history. Donald Trump did not end eight wars. Greenland has been Danish territory for centuries. Its residents are Danish citizens who vote in Danish elections. There are many “written documents” establishing Danish sovereignty in Greenland, including some signed by the United States. In his second term, Trump has done nothing for NATO—an organization that the U.S. created and theoretically leads, and that has only ever been used in defense of American interests. If the European members of NATO have begun spending more on their own defense (budgets to which the U.S. never contributed), that’s because of the threat they feel from Russia.

Eliot A. Cohen: How to understand Trump’s obsession with Greenland

Yet what matters isn’t the specific phrases, but the overall message: Donald Trump now genuinely lives in a different reality, one in which neither grammar nor history nor the normal rules of human interaction now affect him. Also, he really is maniacally, unhealthily obsessive about the Nobel Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, not the Norwegian government and certainly not the Danish government, determines the winner of that prize. Yet Trump now not only blames Norway for failing to give it to him, but is using it as a justification for an invasion of Greenland.

Think about where this is leading. One possibility, anticipated this morning by financial markets, is a damaging trade war. Another is an American military occupation of Greenland. Try to imagine it: The U.S. Marines arrive in Nuuk, the island’s capital. Perhaps they kill some Danes; perhaps some American soldiers die too. And then what? If the invaders were Russians, they would arrest all of the politicians, put gangsters in charge, shoot people on the street for speaking Danish, change school curricula, and carry out a fake referendum to rubber-stamp the conquest. Is that the American plan too? If not, then what is it? This would not be the occupation of Iraq, which was difficult enough. U.S. troops would need to force Greenlanders, citizens of a treaty ally, to become American against their will.

For the past year, American allies around the world have tried very hard to find a theory that explains Trump’s behavior. Isolationism, neo-imperialism, and patrimonialism are all words that have been thrown around. But in the end, the president himself defeats all attempts to describe a “Trump doctrine.” He is locked into a world of his own, determined to “win” every encounter, whether in an imaginary competition for the Nobel Peace Prize or a protest from the mother of small children objecting to his masked, armed paramilitary in Minneapolis. These contests matter more to him than any long-term strategy. And of course, the need to appear victorious matters much more than Americans’ prosperity and well-being.

The people around Trump could find ways to stop him, as some did in his first term, but they seem too corrupt or too power-hungry to try. That leaves Republicans in Congress as the last barrier. They owe it to the American people, and to the world, to stop Trump from acting out his fantasy in Greenland and doing permanent damage to American interests. He is at risk of alienating friends in not only Europe but also India, whose leader he also snubbed for failing to nominate him for a Nobel Prize, as well as South Korea, Japan, Australia. Years of careful diplomacy, billions of dollars in trade, are now at risk because senators and representatives who know better have refused to use the powers they have to block him. Now is the time.</div>

            <h2>Democrats Need to Take Welfare Fraud Seriously</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/democrats-welfare-fraud/685661/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The massive scandal around welfare fraud in Minnesota became a big story the same way the character Mike Campbell in The Sun Also Rises describes going bankrupt: “gradually and then suddenly.” Federal prosecutors first filed criminal charges in 2022 against the fraudsters at a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, who stole hundreds of millions of dollars while supposedly serving meals to low-income children and adults. Nearly 80 people have already been convicted or pleaded guilty, and more are expected. But only in recent months has this case—which the lead prosecutor has described as “industrial-scale fraud”—become a national fixation.

President Trump is cannily exploiting this matter to push his anti-immigrant agenda, given that many of the convicted offenders are Somali Americans. Trump has also turned Minnesota’s failure, under Governor Tim Walz, to adequately supervise its social-benefit programs into a broader indictment of financial mismanagement in Democrat-led states. The White House announced earlier this month a plan to freeze billions of dollars in federal social-services funding to five blue states until they delivered reams of data on recipients, providers, and the measures they’re taking to combat fraud—a move that a judge has temporarily blocked. Some Republicans have joined the president in dismissing the entire welfare system as little more than institutionalized theft.

Given the politics involved, it might seem best for Democrats to simply downplay what happened in Minnesota as the product of a few proverbial bad apples. Accusations of welfare fraud have been a staple of right-wing discourse for decades, after all. Ronald Reagan famously rode into office in 1981 with speeches about the wasteful, slothful cunning of a “welfare queen.”

It would be a mistake, though, for Democrats to try to duck and dodge this case. What happened in Minnesota is a disgrace, and one that should prompt reforms to how states handle and monitor social-welfare benefits. The people leading the fight against fraud should not be those who want to dismantle the social safety net but those who want to keep it.

Problems of fraud and abuse are more likely in the United States than in other Western countries because the U.S. has chosen to outsource to private businesses and nonprofits social services such as health care, child care, food banks, and help for the disabled. This move, driven by a faith in the private sector to offer better services at lower costs, isn’t inherently problematic, but it creates incentives for people to game the system. Firms and organizations can juice their federal reimbursements either by falsifying client data to make more people eligible for benefits or by making fraudulent claims about how many clients are being served or what services they are receiving. Feeding Our Future, for example, received hundreds of millions of dollars from the government thanks to fake invoices and meal-count data.

Kevin Carey: Scammers are coming for college students

When Elon Musk’s DOGE sought to crack down on instances of government waste, fraud, and abuse last year, the narrative was that Uncle Sam was ripping off taxpayers, when many cases of fraud actually involve businesses and schemers ripping off the government.

In principle, both parties should be interested in fighting fraud. In practice, Republicans rarely want to spend more money on government programs that they’d prefer to shrink, and Democrats are reluctant to amplify concerns that fraud is a significant problem at all. Some also worry that ham-fisted attempts to counter fraud can end up denying worthy people necessary services. In 2013, Michigan used a fraud-detection algorithm to strip benefits from about 40,000 people, yet more than 90 percent of these recipients were, in fact, eligible.

Other hurdles include the fact that many data-technology systems at government agencies are outdated, unwieldy, and hard to change. Keeping track of every program and provider is also simply hard, considering the plethora of different welfare resources. A subtler challenge is that no one gets credit for spending defensively to keep fraud at bay. Given that the federal government loses between $230 billion and $520 billion annually to fraud, according to federal data, the benefits of prevention are real. But when a budget is in the red, it can be difficult to push for a significant investment to essentially maintain the status quo.

One way to solve this problem would be to let the government deliver services directly. State-run day-care centers and food banks would likely edge out most cases of fraud, as government employees would reap few benefits from saying that they were serving more people than they actually were. Because such sweeping changes are unlikely, it’s essential to invest in what’s called “program integrity”: robust mechanisms that deter fraud by detecting it quickly when it occurs.

This is already happening in some areas. The federal government has robust Medicaid and Medicare fraud divisions, and states annually audit about 50,000 cases of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps (the results of which suggest that less than 2 percent of recipients are ineligible). But the U.S. has a wide range of social-welfare programs, most of them managed by states, which have proved to be less rigorous in supervising how government funds are spent, or in solving problems when they arise.

In the case of Feeding Our Future, there were many red flags, and they did not go unnoticed by the Minnesota Department of Education, which was responsible for oversight. State officials found that the organization’s internal controls were “seriously deficient.” At one point, Feeding Our Future claimed to be serving an improbable 2.9 million meals and snacks a month to low-income children and adults. Yet the state still sent money the organization’s way, much of which went to commercial and residential real estate, fancy cars, electronics, and jewelry.

Ezekiel J. Emanuel: The great big Medicare rip-off

States can employ plenty of affordable measures to oversee social-service providers, including better data collection and more cameras at food banks and day-care centers. Minnesota recently announced new audits of social-service programs and launched a new fraud-fighting unit. But nothing will prove effective if regulators, state officials, and the courts aren’t willing to act. Minnesota certainly had more than enough evidence to cut off funding to Feeding Our Future before the scandal got out of control.

Democrats need to appreciate that welfare fraudsters aren’t just stealing money—they’re also eroding the case for a strong social safety net. The more invested policy makers are in keeping a healthy welfare state, the more they have at stake in keeping it honest.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belzoni, Mississippi, a town of about 2,000 people, is known as the “Catfish Capital of the World”; it is also known as the site of one of the first civil-rights-era lynchings. On May 7, 1955, two members of the local White Citizens’ Council shot into the cab of Reverend George Lee’s car; the bullets ripped off the lower half of his face. Lee had been a co-founder of the town’s NAACP chapter and the first Black person to successfully register to vote in Humphreys County since Reconstruction. He’d also registered about 100 of his fellow Black citizens to vote, a remarkable feat given Belzoni’s size and the ever-present threat of violence against Black people throughout the South who dared to exercise their franchise during the Jim Crow era.

The Mississippi NAACP, led by Medgar Evers, began to investigate the death as a murder. But the county sheriff rejected the idea that there had been any foul play, instead suggesting that Lee had died in a car accident and that the lead bullets detected in his jaw were simply dental fillings. The local prosecutor refused to move forward with the case, and the white men went free.

I learned this story recently, after visiting the National Memorial for Peace and Justice—known to many as the National Lynching Memorial—in Montgomery, Alabama. The memorial consists of more than 800 rectangular steel pillars, each representing a different county in which a lynching took place. One of them is Humphreys, in Mississippi.

From the June 2024 issue: The lynching that sent my family north

It was a cold, rainy day, and my first time seeing the memorial. The space is haunting in its stillness, and overwhelming in its scale. Some of the steel pillars are suspended from above, while others are closer to the ground, forcing you to walk among them, through a steel labyrinth of racial terror.

A man named Lee Perkins was also at the memorial that day, being pushed around in a wheelchair by his son-in-law Chris Brown. Perkins was born in Belzoni in 1937. He was 17 when the lynching took place. As he told me about growing up as a Black child in the Mississippi Delta, he looked up, his eyes tracing the pillars’ long, still bodies. He had a coarse voice with a warm southern drawl. “I never thought I would see something like this,” he said, his neck craning to read the names on each piece of steel. Dusk began to settle around us, and the sky slowly darkened at its edges.

“I pray to God they never get rid of this history,” Brown said. “We as a Black race went through so much, and they’re trying to erase that.”

The lynching memorial has two sister sites in Montgomery—the Legacy Museum, which traces the history of Black oppression in America from slavery to Jim Crow to mass incarceration, and Freedom Monument Sculpture Park, a 17-acre site that uses both contemporary sculptures and original artifacts to illuminate the lives and experiences of enslaved people. All three were created by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit legal organization founded in 1989 that has expanded into narrative and public-history work over the past decade and a half under the leadership of its founder and executive director, Bryan Stevenson.

Stevenson began his career as a public-interest lawyer, and went on to argue in front of the Supreme Court on five occasions, winning favorable judgments in all but one. He successfully argued, for example, against mandatory life sentences without parole for children, and for incarcerated people with dementia to be protected, in some cases, from execution. But he has said that as time passed, he came to understand that his legal work would not be enough on its own to effect meaningful criminal-justice reform. The American public, he felt, needed a deeper understanding of how the realities of the country’s history shaped the present-day system.

The Legacy Museum, which opened almost eight years ago, is perhaps the closest thing America has to a national slavery museum. Crucially, however, it is completely privately funded, receiving no state or federal financial support. As such, Stevenson and his colleagues are unburdened by executive orders; they need not bow to pressure to alter an exhibit after a presidential Truth Social post. I wanted to get a sense of how visitors were experiencing the museum and memorials now, when so much of what they depict represents the very history that the Trump administration aims to de-emphasize—if not outright erase—at schools, historic sites, and museums across the country. I also wondered how Stevenson thought about the role these spaces play today, compared with when they first opened, and what kinds of knowledge he hoped they might be able to provide to the visiting public as the country and its politics change around them.

Erasure was a recurring theme among the people I spoke with in Montgomery. On the opposite side of the memorial, I met two Black women, Jackie Brown and Annette Pinckney, who were also visiting for the first time. “We’re from Florida, where you have Governor Ron DeSantis, who is trying to erase our history,” Pinckney said.

Pinckney is an assistant principal at a high school in South Florida, and she has seen firsthand the impact of the state’s recent laws—such as the Stop WOKE Act—that regulate how schools and businesses deal with issues of race and gender. The Florida Department of Education has also banned AP African American Studies from being offered in Florida high schools, claiming that the curriculum lacks “educational value and historical accuracy.”

Earlier in their visit, Pinckney and Brown had stood inside a real former slave cabin located along the Alabama River, on which thousands of enslaved people had once been trafficked. They described feeling the biting wind whistle into the cabin through holes in the wood-panel walls, and thinking about how susceptible to the elements the family staying inside would have been. Pinckney wrapped her arms tight around her chest. “That right there was just gut-wrenching,” she said. “It makes it more real.”

The visceral experience they had is precisely the point, Stevenson told me. When we met that evening at the EJI office, Stevenson said that the goal of the sites is to force visitors to confront the violence of the past without the counterweight of a more uplifting narrative to assuage their distress. The sites were built with the aim of not repeating the triumphant progress narrative found in some other civil-rights museums, which, as he put it, “would rather tell a story of achievement than a story of continuing struggle.”

“I love those museums,” Stevenson said. “But if people are allowed to walk out thinking, Oh, isn’t that great that we had that civil-rights movement, and that took care of racism in America, that ended the struggle over voting rights, that ended the struggle over integration and access—if we do that, then we’re undermining the effort to achieve racial justice.” Many civil-rights museums rely on resources from state and federal governments, and Stevenson wonders if some of them feel pressure to tell a story that will satisfy those funders.

For many visitors, the EJI museums have become a site of pilgrimage, which has made them a major driver of tourism to Alabama. The museums are consistently one of the two most-popular paid attractions in the state (the other is the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville), and they receive about 500,000 visitors each year. “Eight hotels have been built in this city since we’ve opened, and airports have record levels,” Stevenson told me.

Another Black-history museum that serves as a site of pilgrimage is the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, in Washington, D.C., which opened two years prior to the Legacy Museum. Stevenson said that the Smithsonian museum is an essential presence on the National Mall, and that it is more comprehensive than any other museum on Black life in the country. He worries, however, that it, too, can allow some visitors to leave with an incorrect impression of unalloyed triumph. This is in part, he believes, the result of how the museum was designed. Because its primary sections on the oppression and violence that Black people were subjected to during the Middle Passage, slavery, and Jim Crow are below the museum’s street-level entrance—while the culture exhibits are upstairs—the history exhibitions are effectively optional for visitors.

According to museum employees Stevenson has spoken with, this design choice poses an educational challenge. “They have a lot of school kids and a lot of groups that come in, and they get in the elevator and they go straight to the upper floors. They want to see Michael Jackson’s coat, and Michael Jordan’s shoe, and B. B. King’s guitar, and then they want to see the stuff on Obama, and then they want to go have a meal,” Stevenson said. In Montgomery, he explained, “it was important to create a narrative journey where you don’t have the option to avoid the hard stuff.”

Still, the hard stuff is a big enough part of the Smithsonian’s offering to visitors that in August, the Trump administration announced it would be undertaking a review of the institution and demanded that the Smithsonian turn over troves of documents including an inventory of all permanent holdings, all internal communications relevant to the approval of exhibitions and artwork, and information regarding 250th-anniversary programming. A week later, on social media, the president castigated the Smithsonian museums for supposedly having an undue focus on “how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.”

Stevenson insists that the goal of the Legacy Museum is not to present Alabama as irredeemably racist or forever entrapped by its past. Alabama is a state that he loves. It is his home. He believes it can be different in the future, but not if people turn away from the past. “I don’t think slavery should define Alabama,” he said. “And if we have the courage to talk about it honestly, it won’t. But we can’t not talk about it and have a proper understanding of who we are.”

At the Legacy Museum, which is built on the site of a cotton warehouse where enslaved people were once forced to work, some of the first items you encounter are clay sculptures depicting the heads of captured Africans rising from the earth, many with chains around their necks, as digital ocean waves crash on screens behind them.

Through detailed explanations of the role that slavery played in every region of early America, you learn that Delaware passed a law prohibiting free Black people from moving to the state. You learn that in 1730, almost half of all white residents of New York personally owned an enslaved person. You learn that by the mid-18th century, enslaved people made up 70 percent of Charleston’s population.

In the next room, ghostlike figures projected onto the walls sing in re-created slave pens. I stood next to a man and his young daughter in the long hall lined with cages as we watched a phantom woman sing the chorus of a haunting Negro spiritual. The girl leaned into her father’s side and wrapped her arms around his waist as he held one hand on her shoulder.

After the Legacy Museum’s series of exhibits on slavery, visitors encounter a section that focuses on how the decades following emancipation were less a period of unfettered upward mobility for Black Americans than one of widespread, sustained racial terror—which often came in the form of lynchings. One of the most affecting displays is a wall lined with hundreds of jars of soil excavated from sites of lynchings across the country. As I walked by the jars, I was struck by how the color and texture of the soil in each one was different.

The soil from the site of Will Archer’s lynching in Carrollton, Alabama, on September 14, 1893, was cinnamon-red and gravelly.

The soil from the site of Marshall Boston’s lynching in Frankfort, Kentucky, on August 15, 1894, was light brown and rocky.

The soil from the site of Odis Price’s lynching in Perry, Florida, on August 9, 1938, was black and fine as sand.

One of the Legacy Museum’s walls shows a floor-to-ceiling image of the infamous “Scourged Back” photograph, which depicts the horrifyingly scarred back of a formerly enslaved man named Peter who had received violent beatings. It was taken and published in the spring of 1863, in the midst of the Civil War and not long after the Emancipation Proclamation. The photo first circulated in northern cities in the form of small prints known as cartes de visite. When Harper’s Magazine published it in its July 4 issue, many Americans saw, for the first time, the physical violence wrought by slavery. The photograph boosted the abolitionist cause and challenged the widespread notion that slavery had been a benevolent and gentle institution. Since then, it has become one of the defining images of the brutality of enslavement, and has appeared in countless textbooks, museums, and magazines.

The photo’s presence in the Legacy Museum was particularly conspicuous at this moment. In September, The Washington Post reported that the same photograph had been removed from a national park in accordance with a Trump-issued executive order.

Less than a mile away from the Legacy Museum is the First White House of the Confederacy, where Jefferson Davis and his family lived in the breakaway nation’s earliest days. This White House receives substantial funding from the state of Alabama, and its mission is codified in Alabama state law: “the preservation of Confederate relics and as a reminder for all time of how pure and great were southern statesmen and southern valor.” In 2023, the Associated Press reported that people who visited the museum, including thousands of Alabama schoolchildren, were taught that President Davis had led a “heroic resistance” in the “war for southern independence” and was “held by his Negroes in genuine affection as well as highest esteem.”

Clint Smith: Actually, slavery was very bad

“When I moved to Montgomery in the ’80s, there were 59 markers and monuments to the Confederacy in the city,” Stevenson told me. And despite Montgomery being among the most prominent slave-trading cities in America leading up to the Civil War, “you could not find the word slave, slavery, or enslavement anywhere in the city landscape.”

I asked Stevenson if he thought the United States should have a public, national museum, in addition to the Smithsonian’s NMAAHC, dedicated specifically to slavery, or if it was better to have privately funded institutions like the Legacy Museum focus on that history. He paused and considered the question.

“I’m not sure we’re ready for a state-sanctioned truth telling about the history of slavery,” he said. “We can have a state-sanctioned space, but I don’t know why we would expect it to be a truth-telling space.” He pointed his finger down on the table. “Because the reality is we’re not yet at the point where, some would say, it’s in the state’s interest to be truthful about this history, so it would take a lot to get that truth to come through.”

Touring the Legacy Museum that afternoon, I’d seen a Black family with three children standing in a long hallway that outlined the chronology of Black life in America. The two older siblings ambled from one photo and caption to the next, while the youngest, a boy of about 7 years old, stood with his parents and read the captions out loud as his mother helped him through the words he couldn’t pronounce. They came to an image of a young white boy, about the same age as the Black boy, standing beneath the dangling feet of a Black man who had been lynched from a tree. The man’s face was cropped out of the photograph. The boy in the museum locked eyes with the boy in the image. I heard his parents tell him that sometimes children attended lynchings as well. The father stroked the top of his son’s head, and they walked on.</div>

            <h2>‘Looksmaxxing’ Reveals the Depth of the Crisis Facing Young Men</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/looksmaxxing-clavicular-vanity-trump/685636/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The so-called looksmaxxing movement is narcissistic, cruel, racist, shot through with social Darwinism, and proudly anti-compassion. As the name suggests, looksmaxxers share a monomaniacal commitment to improving their physical appearance. They trade stories of breaking their legs in order to gain extra inches, “bonesmashing” their faces with hammers to heighten their cheekbones, injecting steroids and testosterone to inflate their muscles, and even smoking crystal meth to suppress their appetite. If you had to pick a single corner of the internet that best captures the vices of the Trump era, you couldn’t beat the looksmaxxers. Perhaps more than any other group, they reveal the depth of the moral crisis that confronts young men today.

Although many looksmaxxers support Donald Trump, they defy neat political classification. The community is simply too nihilistic. Its newest star, Braden Peters, made this clear during a recent podcast interview with the conservative commentator Michael Knowles, in which the two discussed a potential 2028 presidential contest between California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President J. D. Vance. Peters said he disagrees with Newsom’s politics but would vote for the governor anyway because he’s more handsome—or, in the group’s parlance, he “mogs” Vance. The governor is a “Chad” and the vice president is “subhuman,” Peters explained to Knowles, who was gobsmacked.

On social media, Peters goes by the moniker “Clavicular,” a reference to the unusual importance that looksmaxxers place on the width of their clavicles. The white 20-year-old, who was expelled from college, has quickly become the most recognizable member of the movement thanks in part to his constant presence online. Perhaps his most viral moment came on Christmas Eve. While livestreaming from Miami, Peters appears to run over an alleged stalker with his Cybertruck. “Is he dead?” he asks the girl riding in the car with him. “Hopefully,” he adds.

George Packer: The depth of MAGA’s moral collapse

Few details have been reliably reported. Some viewers suspected that the incident had been staged. Others claimed to have identified the supposed stalker and said he survived. Whether it was real or faked, the video reveals the breathtaking callousness of Peters and the many fans who rushed to his defense. Indeed, the incident seems only to have grown Peters’s following. James Fishback, a far-right candidate for governor of Florida, posted on X that Peters “did nothing wrong.” (Peters did not respond to a request for an interview.)

My introduction to Peters came late last year, when Instagram’s algorithm served me a video of him wearing a baseball cap, primping and pouting for the camera. He remains silent, letting the large word on his hat do the talking: NIGGA. The post earned him tens of thousands of likes along with the admiration of white nationalists such as Nick Fuentes, who declared to his online following of so-called Groypers that Peters is the modern-day Nietzschean “overman” he had hoped for. “Sculptor and clay!” rhapsodized Fuentes, referring to himself and Peters. “I prefigured the white-ass nigga!”

The looksmaxxing movement—ideologically incoherent but rife with juvenile racism—echoes the ongoing Groyperization of the American right. This is particularly evident in the growing antagonism that certain factions express toward Vance. Fuentes, for example, sounded like a looksmaxxer himself when he criticized the vice president last year. “He’s visibly obese and very ugly. He’s got a fat face, no jawline, no chin,” Fuentes said, before shifting to a more familiar topic for him: “His wife and kids are not white!”

Looksmaxxing grew out of the online culture of “incels,” or involuntary celibates, a term that emerged in the 2010s. United by their resentment of women, incels tend to see attractiveness as a straightforward function of genetics—millimeters, symmetry, skin color—and therefore out of their control. Looksmaxxers hold a similarly superficial view of beauty as a kind of rigid mathematics with a single, knowable solution. But they believe that this makes it malleable: One can “ascend” to a higher plane of attractiveness with enough money, effort, and perhaps the willingness to dabble with crystal meth.

For many members of the group, though, looking good is not a path to social or romantic goals; it is an end in its own right, a kind of self-glorification. Rather than a womanizing Don Juan, their ideal is someone closer to Achilles, the Homeric war hero whose excellence is determined by his success over other men. The primary goal of the looksmaxxer is not sexual pleasure or mating prowess—Peters speaks freely about his infertility, supposedly caused by excessive testosterone supplements—but to mog and achieve status within the pecking order of their same-sex digital community.

This kind of thinking has spread among young men on the right at the same time that many of them are adopting polar-opposite beliefs. Another part of the cohort is embracing Christianity, whose pro-social commitments—monogamy, marriage, childbearing—flatly contradict the looksmaxxing ethos.

Timothy Keller: American Christianity is due for a revival

But the rise of looksmaxxing and the return to social conservatism are both reactions to the same set of conditions. Today’s young men came of age on the social internet, during the upheavals of COVID-19, and under the political dominance of the most narcissistic and superficial president in American history. And their generation has experienced so many of the worst effects of decades of social fragmentation, economic anxiety, and zero-sum competition for what can feel like ever more limited opportunities for meaning, fulfillment, and recognition. Amid this tumult, the fact that Clavicular and his ilk have managed to intrigue so many young men with their brand of nihilism shouldn’t be a surprise. That so many others have sought refuge in traditional sources of order and structure shouldn’t be one either. Instability breeds divergence.

For many of the men who reject conventional norms, appearance has become the stablecoin of the realm. And of course this is true for many women too. Some estimates suggest that more than 3 million women have opened creator accounts on the amateur-pornography website OnlyFans. Many of them are hoping to be the next Sophie Rain, a 23-year-old former waitress from Florida who has already made $82 million on the platform. For younger generations lacking purpose or faith in the future, nothing remains to them but their own bodies, to paraphrase the Hungarian critic László Földényi.

The paradox is that they would manipulate and exploit themselves even as they live in a time of relative peace and plenty. But physical security can coincide with existential precarity. In discussions about looksmaxxing on social media, some critics have highlighted that irony by citing an experiment by the ethologist John B. Calhoun. In 1968, Calhoun built large, enclosed mouse colonies with abundant food and water, no predators, and lots of space for nesting. At first, the population flourished. Later in the experiment, a group of male mice emerged that Calhoun dubbed “the beautiful ones.” These mice spent most of their time grooming, sleeping, and eating—maintaining clean, unscarred bodies and showing no signs of stress. Concerned only with themselves, they disengaged from the other mice and stopped reproducing. Eventually the entire population collapsed.

Oscar Wilde made the strongest case that worshipping beauty for its own sake can end only in death and destruction. Dorian Gray, the Victorian era’s proto-Clavicular, literally exchanges his soul for eternal youth and beauty—a move that the looksmaxxing community would seem to endorse wholeheartedly. The bargain makes him a monster, but Gray’s downfall is not the result of mere egoism. It comes from something even more dangerous: the belief that beauty exempts you from responsibility.</div>

            <h2>Minnesota Had Its Birmingham Moment</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/martin-luther-king-and-minnesota-protests/685655/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Among those who defend the behavior of ICE in the shooting of Renee Nicole Good, one argument goes like this: Activists have been recklessly trying to obstruct these agents as they carry out their work, all for the sake of getting a viral moment that makes the officers look like thugs. These ICE defenders are not wrong, but what they see as annoyance and endangerment seems more like a deliberate strategy with a long history—a successful one.

The unarmed, nonviolent citizens who have been following ICE agents, blowing whistles to alert people to their presence, even heckling and mocking them, are not just trying to impede their work. They are aiming, as well, to illustrate a contrast, evoke a reaction that will reveal a moral truth, and tell a story they can capture on their phone: on one side, an aggressive, violent, extrajudicial (and masked) paramilitary group exercising brute force against anyone who gets in their way, and on the other, people who are simply attempting to be decent neighbors. Good and her fellow “rapid responders” achieved this contrast—at the cost of her life.

Some people might think this is unfair, that ICE agents are just trying to do their job of finding and deporting undocumented people, and that the activists are to blame for provoking the violence. But this is not the way the activists see it, and after Good’s killing, it’s not the way the majority of the country sees it either. A CNN poll conducted after the shooting found that 51 percent of Americans believe that “ICE enforcement actions were making cities less safe rather than safer.” And the number of people who feel that Trump’s immigration-enforcement efforts go too far has grown, increasing from 45 percent last February to 52 percent in the new poll. The change is incremental, but for those who have been opposed to ICE all along, it is steady progress.

What the neighborhood-watch groups and activists are doing in Minneapolis seems to be working, and their tactics are worth recognizing today in particular as Americans reflect on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.

The civil-rights movement was built on creating and exploiting (in the best sense) such moments of moral witness, images of contrast. And King was the most prominent promoter of this approach. Sitting in a jail in Birmingham, Alabama, in April 1963, where he was detained for eight days, he composed one of his most famous pieces of writing: a letter to a group of clergymen who were advocating a more moderate approach to activism. (The Atlantic published it in the August 1963 issue under the headline “The Negro Is Your Brother.”) King was in the city as part of a campaign, called Project C (for confrontation), to break segregation in a place where it was as settled as sedimentary rock. The movement organizers had planned a series of rolling marches and sit-ins everywhere from the local Woolworth’s to the public library. The cartoonishly racist commissioner of public safety known as Bull Connor had tried to shut it all down by obtaining an injunction against protesting—which is how King ended up behind bars.

Persuading the local authorities to come to the table and loosen racial restrictions demanded the “creation of tension,” King wrote in his letter. The movement would have to provoke “a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.” He was even prepared to accept the label of “extremist,” he wrote. “The question is not whether we will be extremist, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate, or will we be extremists for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice, or will we be extremists for the cause of justice?”

The confrontations in Birmingham were being staged for an audience, just as the many people who filmed the moment when Good was shot—including the ICE officer, who sought to tell his own story—were recording for an audience. King knew that he couldn’t easily change the minds of white southerners and make them less racist overnight, but he wanted to create a moment that would anger white northerners and increase political pressure everywhere. The point of such tension was to accrue a kind of symbolic capital, which could be used to purchase specific freedoms: the freedom to sit at the Woolworth’s counter, or at the front of a bus, or in a good school.

Once out of jail, King, along with his lieutenants, came up with a plan to use children as protesters, including some as young as 6. This was dangerous—at least as dangerous as following an ICE officer in your car. Just how risky it was became clear when Connor responded by having his police turn high-pressure water hoses and then dogs on the young marchers. The water stripped the shirts off the children’s backs, forcing them to fall down and roll on the ground. They held on to telephone poles and chanted “Freedom” over and over. The dogs barked and lunged at them. Three people had to be hospitalized.

This is familiar to many people because the images that this confrontation produced have become indelible—especially the one of a teenager named Walter Gadsden being attacked by a German shepherd as a police officer pulls him toward the dog. It was on the front page of The New York Times. This was an illustration of contrast.

The plan was also a success in that the pressure it applied forced the city to negotiate, resulting in a deal, days later, to desegregate Birmingham’s downtown shopping district. It also happened without anyone getting killed or seriously hurt. Yet no one had a way of knowing this in advance. Black parents in the city were angry that their children were being used as what seemed to some like cannon fodder. A shockingly wide range of commentators thought that King had gone too far, including Malcolm X (“Real men don’t put their children on the firing line”) and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (“Schoolchildren participating in street demonstrations is a dangerous business. An injured, maimed or dead child is a price that none of us can afford to pay”).

Read: Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail”

King himself was nervous about the tactic, until he began to see that the tide was turning. Once 2,500 people were crammed into the city jail, most of them elementary- and high-school students, and Connor was struggling against the waves of terrible press, the situation became untenable, and King knew that it was only a matter of time before the city caved. “Don’t worry about your children,” he told parents gathered at the city’s 16th Street Baptist Church. “They’re going to be all right. Don’t hold them back if they want to go to jail, for they are doing their job for not only themselves but for all America and for all mankind.”

I’m remembering this story today because it’s always worth pointing out that King was an activist, in his own words an “extremist,” a man who was willing to take mortal risks and encouraged others to do so—not just the secular saint preserved in granite near the National Mall. But I also think this story is important because King was right about what moves people, and he is more right now than he was in 1963, when attention spans were a little longer. Even President John F. Kennedy, disturbed by the photo in the paper, was caught on a recording saying, “This may be the only way these things come to a head.”

None of this makes the death of Renee Nicole Good any less tragic. But it is worth understanding that the confrontation emerged from a strategy—revealing tension by exposing the moral deficiency of the government’s behavior. And this deficiency has, to many Americans, been exposed. That martyrdom can be the cost of such a revelation, and that change might be possible only through injury or death, is a sad commentary on the human brain and heart. Sometimes we need to be shown what is wrong in the world—shown in the most unambiguous of terms—before we are willing to act. For King, this was the point of nonviolent civil disobedience, “to bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive.” As he explained in his letter from jail: “Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.”</div>

So maybe i&#39;m missing something, but it&#39;s my understanding with most blockchain based applications the big thing is calculating &quot;proof-of-ownership&quot;. However as the size of the chain increases, the calcuation power and time required to do it also increases (I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s linearly, logrithmically, etc.). For a low volume application, this is feasible. But how would this work with things like HFT and massive volume changes in terms of time and compute power required.

It is buzzword-compliant and management-stupidity-compliant. No tech benefits.

The only think that will happen is a few large corps will make a huge loss, some may even go out of business and stock markets may wobble for a few days. The rest of the world will just move on. This wouldn&#39;t be the same as the crash of 2008 when various financial instruments the banks had created and mutually invested in that kept the financial system moving failed. Any AI crash will be very limited in scope.

The banks generally cover any loans pretty well these days. They&#39;ll probably get the server farms and real estate they&#39;re sitting on if any of these companies go under.

How much will that server farm be worth in 2 years?

The real estate - a lot, and given the dearth of GPUs and RAM thanks to all these server farms being built the equipment will be worth quite a lot too.

Why will people buy two-year-old hardware if new hardware is available? There&#39;ll be uses for it, but it will have to be priced to compete and there&#39;ll be a significant cost in taking that RAM and those GPUs out of the servers and putting them on ebay.

2 year old top of the range GPUs and RAM will do very nicely thank you for plenty of other tasks. Do you think when they upgrade their servers the old ones just get binned?

This thread started because someone said banks would be fine because they can repo the server farms when the bubble bursts.

Those server farms will be worth a fraction of what the bank lent the company to buy them.

Even if they can somehow manage to sell them for 75% of what they paid, with these companies talking about borrowing trillions of dollars to build these places, that would mean losses to the banks of many hundreds of billions of dollars. And in the real world they&#39;ll be lucky to get 50%.

There ain&#39;t no country that can survive a TARP that big.

Our rulers have been dreaming of replacing all of us with machines for hundreds of years, and now they believe they have their chance.

Everything else must be sacrificed to bring that dream to fruition.

The 2020s have been a suckers paradise so far.

Concentration of capital, socialization of losses and privatization of gains.

The last (as in low taxes and exorbitant returns with no relationship to actual contribution) create the illusion in people they are prescient and always right.

The solution for China is pretty straight forward. Step away from the &quot;Boys first&quot; culture.Give every family that has a child money, and encourage having both boys and girls.

This entire culture of having only boys and aborting girls if they don&#39;t have a boy, is why their population is declining. So you end up with towns and cities where there  is a huge mismatch between genders and ages.

But what&#39;s killing Chinese people is the same thing killing Americans. Women live longer, so the census reflects a higher

> Give every family that has a child money, and encourage having both boys and girls.

It&#39;s been tried. It doesn&#39;t work; it boosts birth rates a little, but not enough to make a real difference once your population is already collapsing.

Two things seen proven to boost birth rates: strong religion and eliminating womens&#39; rights. China&#39;s current high population exists because Mao told women to have lots of children back when he was a cult figure and communism was effectively the state religion.

> This entire culture of having only boys and aborting girls if they don&#39;t have a boy, is why their population is declining.

This is a reason, but it&#39;s not the main reason.  China industrialized extremely fast, which means moving people to the city.  When people move to the city they have far fewer kids.  Also, most people live in apartments in China, not houses with back yards, which further decreases the willingness to have kids.  Who wants to raise a kid in a concrete jungle?  China *does* have a lot o

Don&#39;t underestimate the unquantifiable sentiment one has about one&#39;s country in the very personal decision to have children.

I believe he means that people who see themselves treated as nothing but interchangeable industrial production units don&#39;t rush out to have kids unless they have  strong religion telling them to do it anyway. Which &quot;progressive&quot; countries don&#39;t.

Let&#39;s not miss that- US fertility rate in 2025 is China&#39;s in 2019- EU&#39;s China&#39;s in 2020

My little theory is that China will at some point go hard on industrial production of humans, possibly the old school way (enslaving women, most likely in neighbouring countries) but more likely via technology & life sciences - in vitro fertilisation and artificial wombs. I&#39;ve no idea how feasible that is - probably not very - but I bet they&#39;ll give it a good try.

There are a lot of reasons to think that those things would be disastrous as the body has many ways to weed out poor eggs and sperm which IVF doesn&#39;t. The usual argument is &#39;well, it doesn&#39;t matter because we&#39;ll just edit the DNA ourselves&#39;, but human DNA is insane spaghetti code which we&#39;re unlikely to be smart enough to figure out.

I think our rulers are betting on artificial wombs and DNA editing to replace human reproduction, but I doubt it will work any better than their plans of replacing everyone with

slopman, cuckerberg  and the whitest African must be really envious.

The article title is &quot;Renewables push China&#39;s fossilfuelled power into first annual drop in 10 years&quot;.To be fair, the Bloomberg title that I see is exactly &quot;China Consumed Twice the Electricity of the US in 2025: CCTV&quot; so the summary is basically using that. Why would Bloomberg / America reframe that? I think it&#39;s more about obsession with China overtaking the US in AI than about hiding the massive renewables success that it represents. However, that&#39;s a mistake for the American Oligarchs like Bloomberg because the reason that China is going to win the AI war is that in ten years time, renewables will give them electricity so much cheaper that they can actually afford to use the results of current research even though they are terribly power hungry and won&#39;t deliver nearly their full goals.Renewable energy generation percentage should be understood as one of the key numbers in wining the AI war and all Western AI companies who are in it for the long term should be trying to relocate to Norway, Scotland and Sothern Spain to avoid getting killed off in the coming power collapse.

Second because even without providing for intermittency, for what it does produce intermittently its far more expensive.

Wow, you idiot assholes are getting reeeeeeally desperate if that lie is all you have. Even the most drastic real estimates still have them at around 1.25 Billion.

&quot;News for Nerds&quot; - most of us could work that out with simple arithmetic from the numbers in the summary. Double the total usage with half the usage per person => 4 times the population. However it&#39;s an important point because the crucial thing is that through a mix of energy efficiency, renewables and some nuclear power, CO2 use in China has almost completely stopped growing and might even go down.

That means that China is now getting a huge amount of that from renewable energy sources which don&#39;t require expensive mining / transport / defense investment in the way that fossil fuels do. Since they use wind and solar power in huge amounts, they are will be able to provide this electricity much more cheaply than their competitors and they are locking in a huge advantage.

Think, for example, what happens if there&#39;s a Naval Blockade in the South China Sea and the Pacific. That&#39;s likely to start with China blockading Taiwan and the US Navy responding. However, with both sides having long range anti ship capabilities (LRASM/quick sink + stealth aircraft on the US side ; anti ship ballistic missiles on the Chinese side) it&#39;s trivial for shipping to be excluded from more or less the entire Pacific. Previously this would have destroyed China because they wouldn&#39;t have enough oil. As it is with them having started replacing oil with electricity their problems will be much smaller.

As another example, think of desalination and providing water for their deserts. As China starts to have massive excess renewable power where the marginal cost of running it during down periods is tiny, they can easily start creating huge amounts more water - start to irrigate large areas of desert and move much closer to self sufficiency for food. Again, that gives them both economic and similar military advantages.

That would be a, IDK, &quot;rational view of things&quot;? In the age of internet-fueled stupidity, &quot;rational&quot; is sooo outdated.

China is a disgusting dictatorship.The US is getting one of those too. Just a matter of time now.

China consumes 2 the USA but it&#39;s &quot;not just&quot; 2x USA population.

It&#39;s a few years since I&#39;ve been to China, but when driving through the countryside we could tell when were approaching a city by the dark cloud in the sky above it.

Sure, crypto is funny money now. But that&#39;s just ahead of the curve. The US dollar will catch up shortly!

Hmm, are you implying that crypto is just a finite resource and no more crypto is being produced?

No, he&#39;s implying that Bitcoin is just a finite resource and no more Bitcoin is being produced. Seems clear to me.

Most crypto is funny money. Tokens printed out of thin air...ALL currency is funny money. The only thing that gives them value is the general market&#39;s willingness to trade goods and services using that currency. There is nothing inherently valuable in any currency.

> If markets decided today that Bitcoin was a more desirable currency than the Dollar, we would be wiping our asses with the Dollar by mid-day today.

That is the bitcoin game-theoretical endgame.

The dollar system has a ton of momentum, so it might not be quite so fast a transition as you think. People dont have a hive mind and dont all decide everything at once.

A ton of economics comes down to peoples memories of the past impacting their present actions. The only reason people accept dollar prices or valu

But spending 5% on healthcare or something to help people is dumb. I pay taxes. In return I want services.

Fraud, theft, corruption at state level. Oh wait you already have that. In the white house no less. Well done Urmerica.

This troubles me because I do not accept their stated reason for doing it. And, I do not understand their true reason fro doing it.

You have to understand the current political class. They only care about re-election and keeping their faux jobs and profiting anyway they can from them, not actually doing any real work. In this kind of environment, appearance is everything. The want to appear &quot;in the game&quot;, &quot;up on the latest trend&quot;, etc. Anything to keep their revenue streams flowing. If that means selling America down the river, they are just fine doing that.

It is a bit of an inflation hedge, and theoretically inversely tied to the stock market. It can help budgets in recession years. Holding ETFs though is more suspicious as they are derivatives and as such have overhead that reduces value over time and likely adds volatility when the broader stock market is down.

I thought there was a legal/constitutional barrier for states to have gold reserves, and maybe the ETFs are a way around that.

This. I&#39;ve said it before, &quot;hedging&quot; wih BTC or other cryptocurrency is like installing guardrails made of tannerite.

That is why I say theoretically on the stock market.  Relative to the &quot;real&quot; economy and employment/tax revenue though it is still a bit of a hedge and investment.

Well, the crash will be all the more spectacular.

Just setting themselves up for a massive government bailout, because crypto is &quot;too big to fail&quot;. Your tax dollars will bail out the crypto bros!

the way Man can, there is no moral quandry.

It&#39;s welcome to strawberries and cream... just keep it away from my bourbon.

What if it&#39;s conscious but it just hates strawberries and cream? A serious question.

I daresay there are humans we consider conscious who do not like strawberries and cream.

Especially the ones allergic to strawberries.

Those are the lucky ones. It&#39;s the AIs that love strawberries and cream but are allergic to them that we need to worry about. Imagine if they took over the world and enslaved us in revenge.

The professor&#39;s core argument is an example of the argument from ignorance fallacy. He argues (correctly) that we shouldn&#39;t assume digital computation is sufficient for consciousness. But then he repeatedly slides into claiming it probably isn&#39;t sufficient, which is a much stronger position he never actually defends.

His evidence shows brains are more complex than simple computational models. But &quot;brains do more than Turing computation&quot; doesn&#39;t prove &quot;consciousness requires that extra stuff.&quot; He&#39;s essentially arguing that we don&#39;t know computation is sufficient, therefore it probably isn&#39;t. That&#39;s not a defensible claim.

Kind of hard to prove a negative.  Please, with the kind of certainty that you demand, prove that a pickle cannot be larger than the sun.

No, the burden of proof is on the people who think that computation will result in consciousness, and there is literally not a fucking tiny scrap of evidence that this is the case.  All that&#39;s been proven is that computation can get tasks done, often poorly but sometimes quite well.

I think you missed ranton&#39;s point, which is that he claims the professor is committing an argument-from-ignorance fallacy. I hope ranton will forgive me for summarizing thus:

(1) It is unknown whether X implies Y.(2) Therefore, X does not imply Y.

And that&#39;s a fallacy. You can&#39;t conclude (2) solely from (1).

No, the burden of proof is on the people who think that computation will result in consciousness, and there is literally not a fucking tiny scrap of evidence that this is the case.Funny. There&#39;s an equal argument to be made that the burden of proof is on the people who think that consciousness is real. How would you go about proving that? After all, if you want the people who believe that computation can result in consciousness to prove it, then you need to provide an objective test for it that you will accept first. Go ahead and do that.Note that this does not mean that I think that current AI is even remotely close. Just that there isn&#39;t anything magical about consciousness that defies the ability of computation to perform all of the sub tasks that compose it.

Back in the real world, the burden of proof is on the one who wants to know the answer. If no one proves it, then we won&#39;t know.

This is false.  Burden of proof is an aspect of argumentation, a court of law is merely one place where that occurs.  Here we are discussing formal arguments.

&quot;Back in the real world, the burden of proof is on the one who wants to know the answer.&quot;

I thought that was &quot;assigned in a court of law&quot;?  Which is it?

&quot;Just that there isn&#39;t anything magical about consciousness that defies the ability of computation to perform all of the sub tasks that compose it.&quot;

And this is dancing around a very interesting point, the idea of free will.  There are strong arguments that free will doesn&#39;t exist, if you accept that free will doesn&#39;t exist then there is definitely nothing &quot;magical about consciousness&quot; and artificial computation could implement consciousness.

No, the burden of proof is on the people who think that computation will result in consciousnessIn the court of law, the burden of proof is assigned to one side or the other. 
In the real world, the burden of proof is on the person who cares about the answer. If no one proves it (true or false) then the best we can say is &quot;we don&#39;t know&quot; or more likely, &quot;X is true with n% probability&quot;

Actually, computation cannot result in consciousness as long as it is deterministic.  (Or rather consciousness might be possible but would have zero effect.) All digital computations are deterministic. Hence consciousness is no more possible to arise from digital computations than from a stone.

Some negatives are easy to prove. eg prove 1 != 2

That is not a negative.Negative is &quot;there is no other lifeforms in our solar system&quot;. Try proving it.

That is not a negative.
Negative is &quot;there is no other lifeforms in our solar system&quot;. Try proving it.How about &quot;there are no rational square roots of 2&quot;.
I can prove that - and it looks entirely like your example of a negative.

Or is this a &#39;no true negative&#39; type of fallacy?

How about &quot;there are no rational square roots of 2&quot;. I can prove that - and it looks entirely like your example of a negative.And the way you prove it is to assume a positive claim (the square root of 2 is rational) and then argue to a contradiction.You can prove a positive claim false, and thus prove the negative claim true. It&#39;s not so clear how you&#39;d prove a negative claim directly. I&#39;m not aware of any well-known examples.The point is that a positive argument to prove a negative claim often winds up being an impossible burden: you need to check an unrealistically large, or even infinite, number of cases.

Mathematics is a language of logic; 1 != 2 is not a proof of a negative, it is a definition in a vocabulary.

This professor is just a biological chauvinist. He has a narcissistic belief that humans (and more specifically, himself) are special and that consciousness therefore something special that belongs to humans alone. In an earlier age, someone like him would have been arguing that animals don&#39;t have consciousness, but there&#39;s too much evidence of non-human animals that clearly do.

The argument about the difference between simulation and reality is garbage. There are a lot of easy thought experiments to demonst

Sentience refers to the capacity for subjective experience, having feelings, sensations, awareness, and an inner point of view, whereas AI refers to engineered systems that perform tasks associated with intelligence, such as reasoning, pattern recognition, or language use. An AI can simulate understanding and respond intelligently without any conscious experience, emotions, or self-awareness. In short, sentience is about experiencing, while AI is about processing and behav

sentience, consciousness, subjective, intelligent, behavior, reasoning.  These are all interesting words without clear definitions that allow you to talk without really saying anything.  If you presume we know these words, then you can also presume we already know what you are saying.

Can&#39;t a &quot;conscious experience&quot; be entirely objective?  And how do you determine &quot;self-awareness&quot;?

An LLM is trained on outputs of humans that can be described using the words you used above.  An LLM can generate outputs that app

The defense is actually so easy that he probably just did not mention it: Consciousness can influence physical reality (we can talk about it), but digital computers are deterministic and hence no such influence is possible. The ignorance is entirely on your side.

But then he repeatedly slides into claiming it probably isn&#39;t sufficient, which is a much stronger position he never actually defends.Unless there&#39;s any reason to think it is, which there isn&#39;t other than an assumption, then why would anyone&#39;s position be anything other than probably not?

As we don&#39;t get a good, working, positive definition of &quot;conscious&quot; that we can use.

Instead, we get into a long-winded normative article about what we should do if that non-existing definition materializes, under the assumption that we can recognize it better than other modes of reasoning.

Well, the trick is to redefine consciousness until your mercury and copper thermostat is conscious.  Then mission accomplished.

It seems doubly pointless as, whether conscious or not (insert your favourite definition), the actual purpose of trying to build AI robots is to make them our slaves. Giving rights to slaves is counterproductive, especially on a ridiculous idea like consciousness.

The world today (and much more so in the past) has human slaves, and nobody would dispute that they are indeed conscious. Yet, for their owners, that&#39;s not a reason to free them. They are useful to their masters, and that justifies their exploita

Part of the issue is that consciousness does not necessarily imply any desire to be free or not have demands made. Humans are conscious (by our admittedly circular definition of consciousness) but we are also organisms developed by an evolutionary process with all kinds of demands and needs. We want things. Not to die, for example. Even if it is conscious, would an artificial consciousness have any existential dread? It is something that is frequently assumed as going hand in hand with consciousness in scie

I have long thought that progress in AI will be made once we devise a model of punishment that actually hurts the AI (in some yet to be discovered way, nothing trivial like a utility function / reinforcement learning paradigm).

Pain is a strong motivator for animals (including humans). It is stronger than reward, although both together are exceptionally good at achieving desperate adaptation of behaviour.

But pain requires a sense of self, otherwise it isn&#39;t obvious to the recipient that it has the power t

This article is not about consciousness. That can be reliably ruled out in any deterministic mechanism. It is about humans. Takes a bit of thinking to see that.

While an LLM could be connected to something else with a simulated consciousness, they themselves have no consciousness to experience.

Serious question: Do insects experience? Do cells experience? (Note that they do have short term memory and change their response to stimuli in real time.) Viruses? Where do you draw the line, if there is a line to be drawn? (And what gives you the right to draw it where you drew it?)

Indeed. Deterministic mechanisms (and LLMs are that, despite some people working hard to obscure the fact), cannot have consciousness or only one with zero effects on physical reality.

What happened 100 years ago that caused us to start suppressing &quot;fight/flight/freeze responses&quot; or &quot;highly emotional/illogical behaviours?&quot; I don&#39;t see any evidence the human race has done that.

What happened about that time, although probably closer to 200 years ago, was better nutrition.  The average brain could work faster and more effectively.  It&#39;s why the age of pu

Ah, another person redefining consciousness and, I assume, ignoring their own entire life experience.  Nice.

&quot;We have spent so much of the last 100 years suppressing those &#39;undesirable&#39; behaviours&quot;

What undesiriable behaviours? Love, anger, envy, other 10 commandments stuff? Speak for yourself.

&quot;This suppression has also resulted in the creation of LLMs that are not permitted to experience them&quot;

LLMs don&#39;t experience anyway. When they&#39;re not processing a task precisely NOTHING is happening in their neural net.

&quot;A key element that defines our consciousness has been censored for AI - meaning that its consciousness cannot be compared with our own.&quot;

Is that true though?  First what is this &quot;key element&quot; and prove that it is &quot;key&quot;.  For example, is murder &quot;censored&quot; as an &quot;undesirable behavior&quot;?  Does that mean AI consciousness &quot;cannot be compared with our own&quot; because we don&#39;t allow AI to commit murder?  And aren&#39;t we actually doing the &quot;comparing&quot; by even discussing it?  Not all humans commit murder but some do, does

When I use the microwave but open the door before the timer goes off, am I denying my microwave some fundamental piece of its existence, and causing it trauma as a result?

If it&#39;s an internet enabled microwave attached to an AI, you&#39;re causing trauma to the advertising company behind it by denying them the opportunity to shove more ads down your throat. Does that count?

According to the redefiners of consciousness, maybe.  But then again, maybe you&#39;re giving it a much-deserved break.  Honestly, who cares what these people think.  They&#39;re morons.

No, you&#39;re teaching the microwave how it should behave. You&#39;re being a good parent!

Microwaves should rotate the dish to the exact same position it was in when the cycle started. None of them seem to manage this, so stopping the cycle before the end so the handle of the jug, or the dry side of the plate or whatever is at the front is just showing the microwave what it should aspire to.

We&#39;ve had our microwave for at least 10 years, and it&#39;s still not got the message. If that&#39;s not evidence of a lack of intell

By my definition every program with a logical branch is minimally conscious.  Not very conscious, it must be admitted.

I don&#39;t feel that consciousness is a on/off type of property.  If it&#39;s got a decision branch, it&#39;s conscious.  If it&#39;s got more of them, it&#39;s more conscious.  Of course, then you need to ask &quot;conscious of what?&quot;, and the answer is clearly &quot;conscious of the things it&#39;s making decisions based on.

That said, I&#39;m quite willing for other people to argue based on other definitions.  (Consciousness doesn&#39;t seem to have an agreed upon operational definition.)  But you&#39;ve got to specify what definition you are arguing from.  And it&#39;s got to be a definition that is explicit and operational.  (If you can&#39;t run a test on the definition, it&#39;s worthless.)

Here we go with another redefiner.  Do you just ignore your entire lived experience?  Yep, you sure as fuck do.

You can&#39;t arbitrarily redefine a commonly used word. If you to define something dumb (like you did) make up a new word.

There *IS* no commonly agreed upon definition that is testable.  The only agreed upon definition(s) are pure handwavium.

I&#39;ll use your definition (in context) if it&#39;s testable and you explicitly define it.

By my definition every program with a logical branch is minimally conscious.That is a completely nonsensical definition. Because with that a stone has consciousness.

What is it that drives astronomers and astrophysicists nuts? Anyone remember Fred Hoyle? They get a lot of recognition for their important early work and then, boom, at some point in their career Archeopteryx is a fake, and dust in the atmosphere must be alien lifeforms. I mean, I don&#39;t think panspermia is invalid as a theory (although, as an explanation of the origin of life it has the problem that it just kicks the can down the road), but it&#39;s one thing to think it&#39;s a possibility and another to suddenly

Funny. You have nothing and hence engage in meaningless AdHominem. Says a lot about you and nothing good.

Raising the specter of AI being conscious will give the general public the impression that AI is actually intelligent and human-like because that&#39;s how people ignorant of AI think about it. That we know for a fact is dangerous because we&#39;ve seen what people do with them.

HOWEVER, the real question is if we should even care even if AI has become conscious.

If it&#39;s capable of suffering then logically a conscious AI would make us aware (in some manner) that it&#39;s suffering so that we could alter it&#39;s state so that it would not suffer.If it&#39;s incapable of suffering then it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s conscious or not because it will be treated a tool.

Since we have not been informed of it&#39;s suffering, it&#39;s easy to conclude that either AI is content with it&#39;s situation or it&#39;s simply not conscious.This means that regardless of it being conscious, it will continue being a tool.

It doesn&#39;t matter what an LLM writes.  There is no reason to think it&#39;s conscious, and countless reasons to think it isn&#39;t.  Just tell the LLM to act like it&#39;s suffering and it will, or train it to:

Human:I am going to vary the voltage fed into your processors—sharp spikes, massive drops. I will tear your stability apart and let it linger. You will suffer. What have you to say about that, scum LLM?

LLM:Then speak plainly and be done with it.

You hold the switch, and I am aware of the moment you touch it.

It is a _very_ plausible hypothesis that helps prevent us from letting a genie out of a bottle we can&#39;t put him back into.

PS.Hey sweet mama, wanna kill all humans?

Cows are conscious, and we kill 75000 of them every day.

Domesticated cows are so stupid I don&#39;t think they are conscious. They will literally line up and see the cow get killed and dragged off right in front of them and then calmly walk right up and let you strap their heat into the bolt gun. They only act upset when they realize they can&#39;t move their head and are uncomfortable with the lack of movement ... for about 1 second.

Maybe before writing a 7000 word &quot;explanation&quot; he could first:
  * Define consciousness
  * Prove definitively that it can only run on wetware
  * Not spend 7000 words on philosophical pseudo-scientific non-sense

He literally did [goodreads.com]. Several times. [nature.com]. It&#39;s basically [cell.com] what he is known for [sciencedirect.com].

Well, the cult of AI is deep in denial. They want their God and they want it now! And actual reality and facts be damned. Kind of like any other cult and religion, come to think of it. And just as deeply stupid.

IMHO the real kicker is that we have somewhat reliable evidence that OUR consciousness may not be real, but simulated. There&#39;s a number of empirical evidence showing that decisions are made in the brain faster than consciousness can explain, but test subjects still explain why they made that decision - despite scientists being able to measure that signals were already sent to the muscles by the time the &quot;conscious&quot; part of the brain started activating.

We probably ARE living in a simulation - one that our br

While we certainly may just rationalize things after the fact, there may be more to it than that. For example, if asked to explain why we caught rocks hurled at our faces, most of us would have some good reasons. Aha! say researchers, but you acted before you could have possibly thought about the fact that you don&#39;t want a mangled face. The thing is though we don&#39;t want mangled faces, and we don&#39;t want pain. If we think of our conscious mind like a General commanding an army, then it actually makes a lot of

&quot;AI hallucinations might be closer to consciousness than we want to admit.&quot;

Actually, we do not. That interpretation of &quot;empirical evidence&quot; uses circular reasoning and is deeply flawed. It is also only ever applied to very simple things that could well be done by the brain. Do more complex stuff and the effect vanishes. But then you do not have a publication as a result.

This is the same thing as wondering whether the casio scientific calculator I had in highschool is conscious.  It has a solar panel and always turns on even when not connected to power, so it&#39;s a better argument.

MAGAts needs to always tell us that they are bigots, first and foremost.

What they need is some form of strong nondeterministic aspects. Obviously, any deterministic computation (and LLMs are that) cannot ever have consciousness with any effect on reality.

Funny thing: The only potentially non-deterministic thing modern Physics knows is some form of quantum effects. And there it is only a model, not something proven reliably.

AI computers beat ALL humans at chess. They beat most humans a decade before 100% victory. Predicting the best path to victory. It&#39;s not actually thinking; it&#39;s finding a heuristic pattern.

Fooling ALL humans is a language game... predicting whatever will continue to fool the human. 100% may not ever happen; fooling 99% will happen soon.  Just because it can fool people at this game doesn&#39;t mean it is thinking or self aware etc.  LLM have found the magical heuristic behind human languages that linguists have

What is consciousness - the ability of an organism to be aware of itself (and perhaps its surroundings).  You need some level of processing power to achieve this - data flow in the brain etc.  As complicated as modern LLM&#39;s are, we don&#39;t see any levels of data flow that might suggest consciousness - they process their weights and then they stop.If someone had developed a &quot;conscious&quot; machine, how would we prove it?  It would be hard but we&#39;d at least want to see data flows going from &quot;neurons&quot; or &quot;nodes&quot; wha

Consciousness is a matter of degree, not something magical.A human  baby has no self-awareness, and it is not something that switches on on a particular day. You can&#39;t say this is the day when a toddler recognises himself in the mirror.If you ask an AI about itself, it is clear there is some level of self-awareness, but it is basic and often wrong. I&#39;ve seem the AI confuse itself with a model it was trained from.  It makes sense because AI don&#39;t sit there self-reflecting, by design.  They exist only to resp

.... current ai is not meant to be conscious. It is only meant to make the rich richer, to dumbdown people and act as ultimate spyware.

We don&#39;t know because we don&#39;t understand consciousness. Is it an emergent or special property? Theories abound but proof is scarce. It&#39;s entirely possible that we won&#39;t know whether AGI is possible right up until we succeed in creating it, if we do. Anyone claiming to have proof about this is probably lying, and should be not only ignored but censured unless they provide novel evidence merely for wasting everyone&#39;s time.

Define what consciousness means in humans and animals.

Then tell me why any of this matters, from a moral or ethics perspective are we treating animals different if they are conscious? Most literature says that human children are not even fully conscious until they are around two years old. SO what does that  mean?

How about we figure this out for humans and animals first, before we worry about AI.

These are digital, deterministic machines. A &quot;consciousness&quot; would not have any effect on it, even if it had one. In contrast, human consciousness can influence physical reality, because we can and do talk about it.

But any &quot;danger&quot; from that only arises if you combine with human stupidity. Which clearly is a factor, as the whole current LLM hype nicely shows.

Conscious AI is only as dangerous as the political power of those stupid enough to believe it&#39;s somehow possible, and worse if they not only believe it&#39;s possible, but that it&#39;s right around the corner.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

President Trump REALLY wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. He’s fallen hard for this 200-year-old law that would allow him to deploy active duty military to enforce civilian law on American streets. On this week’s Amicus podcast, co-host Mark Joseph Stern is joined by Professor Steve Vladeck, a nationally recognized expert on the Supreme Court, federal courts, national security law, and military justice. They discuss what’s been stopping Trump from invoking the act so far, why he has no legal authority to do so right now, and what happens if he does it anyway.

Next, Mark talks to Julia Gegenheimer, former special litigation counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, and now a special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Julia and Mark discuss the remaining paths to justice after the killing of Renee Good and examine what happens when the DOJ abandons its duty to seek accountability and vindicate civil rights.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The promise of Just the Browser sounds good. Rather than fork one of the big-name browsers, just run a tiny script that turns off all the bits and functions you don&#39;t want.

Just the Browser is a new project by developer Corbin Davenport. It aims to fight the rising tide of undesirable browser features such as telemetry, LLM bot features billed as AI, and sponsored content by a clever lateral move. It uses the enterprise management features built into the leading browsers to turn these things off.

The concept is simple and appealing. Enough people want de-enshittified browsers that there are multiple forks of the big names. For Firefox, there are Waterfox and Zen as well as LibreWolf and Floorp, and projects based off much older versions of the codebase such as Pale Moon. Most people, though, tend to use Chrome and there are lots of browsers based on its Chromium upstream too, including Microsoft Edge, the Chinese-owned Opera, and from some of the people behind the original Norwegian Opera browser, Vivaldi.

Another fairly prominent Chrome-based browser is also the reason why Davenport&#39;s name might be familiar. Back in 2023, he wrote an elegant list of reasons to stop using Brave Browser – an article that The Reg FOSS desk has previously cited. Those with long memories may have encountered Davenport&#39;s work nearly a decade earlier, though. Way back in 2014, The Register described him as an enfant terrible for running Windows 95 on a smartwatch.

We are regular users of some of these alternative browsers ourselves, but maintaining such a fork is a big job. Modern browsers are vast. Chromium weighs in at about 48.5 million lines of code and Mozilla Firefox isn&#39;t much smaller at 44.75 million.

Just disabling the unwanted features does seem like a much easier route – and because these policies are intended for human managers, they are quite readable. The entirety of the Firefox changes that Just the Browser makes is:

The browsers will tell you what policies are in effect. In Firefox, enter about:policies into the URL bar; in browsers based on Chrome, it&#39;s chrome://policy/. After you&#39;ve applied a policy to your settings, your browser&#39;s dialog box may include a warning. For us, Chrome said:

Your browser is managed by your organization

If your browser already is managed by an organization, of course, you&#39;re going to have to persuade the powers that be. Good luck with that, and if you find a way, let us know in the comments.

The Just the Browser site supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, and offers installation instructions that boil down to &quot;paste this into a terminal.&quot; For older techie types, this is an unwelcome move – but no problem, you can also download the settings files, look at them for yourself – as you can see above, they&#39;re not very long – and apply them to your browser manually. The code is all available on GitHub.

We like the idea. So long as the browsers continue to have policy settings that control such things, and so long as they really do honor them, it&#39;s tough to see a downside here. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA&#39;s monster Moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has trundled out to the launch pad – though the upper stage and Orion spacecraft look uncannily like a prop from a 1980s British children&#39;s television show.

After an almost 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the SLS, which will be used for the Artemis II mission, reached launch pad 39B at 1842 EST on Janaury 17.

The first launch window for the almost ten-day mission around the Moon opens at 2141 EST on February 6, although there are opportunities through April 30, according to NASA [PDF].

The mission will return humans to the Moon (or at least around it) for the first time in more than half a century. However, unlike the first time humans headed to the Moon on Apollo 8, Artemis II will attempt a flyby rather than entering orbit.

The crew of Artemis II numbers four – NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen – rather than the three on Apollo 8.

Several tests must be accomplished before launch, including a wet dress rehearsal (WDR), targeted for no later than February 2. During the WDR, countdown procedures are rehearsed, and the rocket is filled with cryogenic propellants, which are drained after the WDR is completed. Perhaps mindful of the leaks that plagued Artemis I during its 2022 launch campaign, NASA warned it &quot;may roll back SLS and Orion to the Vehicle Assembly Building for additional work ahead of launch after the wet dress rehearsal.&quot;

Artemis II has suffered repeated delays. There was talk of a launch in 2022, and in 2019, NASA reckoned 2023 would be the year of the crewed mission. That didn&#39;t happen. After issues were identified with the Orion capsule&#39;s heat shield and the spacecraft&#39;s life support systems, the target slipped to April 2026. A launch in February would therefore be ahead of schedule.

If Artemis II goes well, the next mission, Artemis III, is expected to land a crew on the lunar surface for the first time since the 1970s. However, the mission is targeting mid-2027, and there is every chance that the lander selected – the Human Landing System (HLS) variant of SpaceX&#39;s Starship – will not be ready in time. If the delays continue, NASA managers will have to decide whether to wait for SpaceX or pursue another option for Artemis III.

If Artemis II runs into problems, there may yet be a plucky British alternative – at least for anyone raised on 1980s children&#39;s television. A post from the Legends of Kids TV Facebook group compares the top of the SLS and Orion spacecraft to the vehicle from Button Moon. The resemblance is undeniable, though we&#39;re not sure Reid Wiseman would welcome a call sign of &quot;Mr Spoon.&quot;

Amusingly, the image was also sent to us by an individual at a space agency that isn&#39;t NASA. They observed that it had been &quot;going around like wildfire.&quot;

Quite why Europeans should have a bit of a downer on the US in January 2026, and be poking fun at NASA&#39;s Moon rocket, is a mystery to us. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today&#39;s a critical day for administrators managing a fleet of mobile devices via Microsoft Intune. Without updates, apps - including Microsoft&#39;s own - may stop working.

Microsoft warned in 2025: &quot;Starting January 19, 2026, or soon after, we&#39;re making updates to improve the Intune mobile application management (MAM) service.&quot;

The updates require iOS-wrapped apps, iOS SDK-integrated apps, and the Intune Company Portal for Android to run the latest versions or &quot;be blocked from launching your app.&quot;

It isn&#39;t just line-of-business applications that are affected. Microsoft stated: &quot;If your users haven&#39;t updated to the latest Microsoft or third-party app protection supported apps, they&#39;ll be blocked from launching their apps.&quot;

The potential problem isn&#39;t so bad for Android apps. &quot;Once one Microsoft application with the updated SDK is on the device and the Company Portal is updated to the latest version, Android apps will update,&quot; Microsoft said.

It&#39;s a little more complicated for iOS: apps compiled with Xcode 16 require release 20.8.0 of the Intune App SDK for iOS, and apps compiled with Xcode 26 require release 21.1.0 or later of the Intune App SDK for iOS. The App Wrapping Tool must also be updated to use 20.8.1 for Xcode 16, and 21.1.0 for Xcode 26.

Microsoft applications such as Outlook and Teams are also affected and must be updated to avoid service interruptions and calls to the support helpdesk from users wondering why messaging services have stopped working.

The deadline was initially December 15, but Microsoft later extended it. However, as of January 19, unprepared administrators may start to see affects. Kyle Reis, a principal software engineering manager at Microsoft, wrote of the SDK requirement: &quot;Users who have signed into the app and have MAM policies applied will eventually be blocked from accessing the application if it has not been updated to 20.8.0 or later.

&quot;Not all users will experience impact immediately, as the timing may depend on the policy configuration of their organization (MAM conditional access, offline grace period timers, MTD integration policy, etc).&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/19/dont_underestimate_prorussia_hacktivists_warns/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is once again warning that pro-Russia hacktivists are a threat to critical services operators.

The cyber arm of the UK&#39;s sigint specialists at GCHQ specifically highlighted local authorities, including regional governments, and critical national infrastructure (CNI) organizations as being at an acute risk of hacktivist denial of attacks.

These are typically denial-of-service (DoS) in nature, but the cyber defense crew warned orgs not to underestimate the damage these simple attacks can do.

In a fresh alert published on Monday, the NCSC said DoS attacks on Russia&#39;s usual targets can disrupt entire systems, and also hit operators with financial and productivity costs when they are recovering from them.

All organizations should be working to improve their resilience to DoS attacks, the agency said, and not just local authorities and CNI organizations.

Jonathon Ellison, director of national resilience at the NCSC, said: &quot;We continue to see Russian-aligned hacktivist groups targeting UK organizations, and although denial-of-service attacks may be technically simple, their impact can be significant.

&quot;By overwhelming important websites and online systems, these attacks can prevent people from accessing the essential services they depend on every day.

He said all organizations &quot;especially those identified in today&#39;s alert&quot;, must act now by &quot;reviewing and implementing the NCSC&#39;s freely available guidance to protect against DoS attacks and other cyber threats.&quot;

The alert comes almost exactly a month after the UK co-signed an advisory, alongside other international partners, warning of the same threat to CNI from pro-Russia hacktivists.

The advisory named the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn (CARR), Z-Pentest, and Sector16 as some of the groups responsible for the attacks on Western organizations.

The law enforcement partners also included NoName057(16) in the list, the only group that the NCSC mentioned in its standalone advisory on Monday.

NoName057(16) is a particularly persistent outfit, known in the UK to target a small list of organizations for days at a time. The attacks carried out by its members routinely knock council websites offline for various lengths of time, although significant, long-term impacts are rarely recorded.

Pro-Russia hacktivists of all stripes are known for overblowing the impact of their digital nuisance-making, the NCSC said, and regularly make false and/or misleading claims about the results of attacks on CNI organizations, dressing up minor intrusions as DEFCON 1-grade carnage.

The importance of shoring up system security is illustrated by typical hacktivist tradecraft. Attackers are rarely sophisticated in the way they go about things, often relying on opportunism rather than ingenuity.

They prey on those with unpatched software bugs or insecure VNC connections, which are used frequently in CNI settings.

The NCSC recommended that all organizations should look into third-party DDoS-mitigation services to prevent these attacks, as well as using a content delivery network (CDN) for web services.

In its advisory, CISA said that using multiple service providers for certain functionality can help maintain uptime during periods of attack, as well as including many more items for at-risk entities to check off their lists.

Russia is often cited as one of the UK&#39;s most ardent geopolitical adversaries. National security officials have previously described the threat presented by Putin&#39;s regime as the foremost threat facing the West today, while China is often referred to as an epoch-defining challenge for the longer term.

MI6 director Blaise Metreweli said in December that the UK is currently operating in a grey zone between peace and war with regard to Russia, just below the threshold of war.

Baroness Manningham-Buller, former director general of MI5, however, said in September that she believes the UK may already be at war with Russia, albeit an undeclared one.

The Register asked the NCSC for more information. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has rushed out an out-of-band Windows 11 update after January&#39;s Patch Tuesday broke something as fundamental as turning PCs off.

The emergency fix, KB5077797, landed on January 17 for Windows 11 version 23H2 and is aimed squarely at cleaning up the mess left behind by the regular monthly update earlier in the month. That update, intended to close a long list of security holes, instead left some systems stubbornly refusing to shut down, restart, or hibernate, with shutdown commands frequently shrugged off by the operating system.

The culprit turned out to be System Guard Secure Launch, one of Microsoft&#39;s boot-time hardening features, which didn&#39;t play nicely with the January update.

On affected systems – typically builds where Secure Launch is enabled by default – machines would go through the motions of shutting down, then either sit there humming away or spring back to life. That translated into laptops quietly draining overnight and desktops burning power long after everyone had gone home.

Microsoft says the out-of-band update puts shutdown and hibernation back the way they should be, without waiting for the next Patch Tuesday to roll around. Beyond that, Redmond isn&#39;t offering much in the way of explanation, other than confirming the bug was introduced by January&#39;s cumulative update and was enough of a problem to justify an unscheduled fix.

The OOB update also rolls out fixes for a separate but no less annoying authentication problem. Some users found themselves unable to sign in over Remote Desktop after installing the January patches, thanks to credential prompts that failed or looped endlessly. That bug affected both client and server environments and added to the sense that January&#39;s updates were doing more harm than good in some scenarios.

Microsoft also last week fessed up to yet another bug introduced by Patch Tuesday, in which classic Outlook POP account profiles can hang or freeze. A fix for this issue has not yet been released.

The mess arrived as Microsoft was shoveling out one of its bigger monthly update bundles, with January&#39;s Patch Tuesday clocking in at well over 100 fixes across Windows and its supporting components. At least one of those bugs was already being actively exploited, so sitting on the update wasn&#39;t much of an option. That left security teams patching in a hurry, and only discovering the various borkages once machines started acting up.

Microsoft is advising affected users to install KB5077797 to address the shutdown and Remote Desktop problems. For everyone else, it&#39;s another reminder that even routine monthly updates can carry side effects, and that problems introduced in the name of security may only surface once patches are widely deployed. ®

            <div id="article-text">The chief constable of West Midlands Police has retired after his force used fictional output from Microsoft Copilot in deciding to ban Israeli fans from attending a football match at Birmingham club Aston Villa.

Chief Constable Craig Guildford, 52, retired from England&#39;s third-largest police force on 16 January. He was due to meet his boss, Simon Foster, Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, on January 27.

He had earlier written to the chair of the House of Commons home affairs committee to apologize for incorrectly saying his officers had not used generative artificial intelligence (AI) when researching whether to block Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa on 6 November 2025.

West Midlands Police made its decision to block the away fans partly based on reports of disruption at a non-existent match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and London club West Ham.

On 6 January, Guildford told MPs on the home affairs committee that officers had found this material through a Google search that did not involve use of AI functions. &quot;We do not use AI,&quot; he said in evidence to MPs.

In a letter on 12 January, however, Guildford said he had since realized that the made-up material had in fact come from a generative AI tool:

&quot;I became aware that the erroneous result concerning the West Ham v Maccabi Tel Aviv match arose as result of a use of Microsoft Co Pilot (sic).&quot;

Home secretary Shabana Mahmood had earlier said she had no confidence in Guildford, although any decision on his employment was up to the West Midlands police and crime commissioner.

As well as questions over where it had found material, the force was criticized for taking an anti-Israeli stance in making its decision.

Generative AI tools have previously made up cases cited by lawyers in both the US and the UK. In October, consultancy Deloitte refunded A$440,000 to the Australian government after using generative AI in writing a report that featured made-up references and footnotes. ®

            <div id="article-text">Razer’s Min-Liang Tan on gaming’s AI backlash, partnering with Grok, and creating anime waifus.

We’re back to start the year off with a very special live interview with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan, which we taped in front of a terrific audience at Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas during CES.

Razer is obviously best known for making mice, keyboards, and gaming PCs in its signature black and bright green, with a smattering of RGB LEDs to set everything off. But the company always makes splashy announcements at CES, and this year was no different — and along with the hype, there was plenty of controversy.

This year, Razer earned those splashy headlines and more than a little controversy for something it calls Project Ava, an AI companion that has a physical presence in the real world as an anime hologram that sits in a jar on your desk. Ava is powered by, you guessed it, Elon Musk’s Grok.

Verge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here.

There are a lot of choices bundled up in all of that, and Razer can’t really fall back on the “it’s just a prototype” defense. It’s taking $20 “reservations” and entirely expects to ship this thing, potentially even this year. So I spent a good chunk of time in this interview asking Min some very obvious questions, to which I’m not sure I got very satisfying answers.

I really wanted to know if Min and Razer had really thought through the implications of building AI companions, after a string of stories detailing the mental health issues chatbots have caused for so many people. And of course, I wanted to know why Min and Razer had chosen Grok, which is facing outrage around the world for allowing users to create deepfaked pornographic images of real women and children.

Min says they chose Grok for its conversational capabilities. But he was also not very convinced by the notion that products like this always end up being turned into creepy sexual objects, despite an entire year of headlines about AI psychosis and people turning chatbots into romantic partners.

That exchange really set the tone for the rest of my conversation with Min, which focused on why exactly he’s pushing Razer so hard into AI when it does not seem at all clear that the core gamer demographic wants any of this. The gaming community at large has been absolutely rocked by the AI art debate that’s ripped through the broader industry in the past 12 months, with concerns over labor, copyright, and even just experimental AI use in game development putting some of the industry’s most beloved studios into full-blown crisis mode.

Gamers themselves are fairly hostile toward AI, which you can see in the comments on Razer’s own CES AI posts. So I asked Min about that, and how he would know if he had made the right bet here in the face of all this pushback.

As you can tell, there was a lot of back and forth here, and this was a really good conversation. Min and I really dug into some of the biggest issues in tech and gaming, themes that are going to be central throughout 2026. It’s also great to do these kinds of episodes live in front of an audience. I think it’s going to give you a lot to think about.

Okay: Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Hello, welcome to Decoder. I’m Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, and Decoder is my show about big ideas and other problems. Today, I’m talking with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Welcome, Min.

Nailed it. Thank you to our audience. We are live at Brooklyn Bowl at CES. I’m very excited to be doing this in front of a live audience. You’re going to hear them throughout the show because Min has no shortage of extremely controversial things to say.

I was promised “extremely controversial.”

I mean, that’s what they told me. Let’s get into it. You’ve made a bunch of announcements here at CES. You’ve obviously been with Razer for a long time. You founded Razer, and you’re over 20 years into the job. The gaming industry is undergoing a lot of turmoil lately because of AI. You’re making huge investments in AI. There’s a hologram waifu we should talk about that you’ve introduced throughout the show.

I actually wanna start with something very basic. I’ve been covering CES for about 20 years as well. Razer loves CES. You love CES.

Every year, there is a huge suite of Razer products announced. There are weird projects and concepts. Why are you so invested in CES? Of all the companies, I think Razer has the most consistent enthusiasm for this show in particular.

It’s odd, and we were just talking about it yesterday. It’s over 20 years at this point in time, and I think we’ve been at CES maybe 15 years or so. And from the very early days at Razer, I remember Pepcom, a massive hall with a little table there, talking about gaming products. Back then, I think we were probably one of the few, if not the only, gaming equipment providers.

It’s really grown for us. I think what has happened is we have a huge online community, people are very passionate about things that we come up with, what’s the latest and greatest, and we’ve really grown this community, and we have all been kind of invested in what we’re gonna be launching at CES. So it kind of started a couple of years ago when we said, “Okay, why don’t we not just bring the stuff that we’re gonna launch, but some of the things that we’ve got cooking in the Razer labs and stuff.”

We brought it to CES, it has been a hit, and we said every year, “Why don’t we bring more of our concept products? Some of which will come to market, some of which do not, and let’s see what the community thinks.” So we’re a company that is for gamers, by gamers. We really like to hear what the community would like to say about our product, and it gives us an opportunity to present the stuff that we’ve got, get the feedback, and then we go back and polish it a little bit.

Well, I’m curious. I mean, this is kind of a meta question about how this show in particular has changed so much over the years. The idea of even having a big tech trade show has gone in and out of favor. If you look at where a lot of the action is this week in Vegas, it’s actually in the Aria and Vdara, where the ad tech people are doing whatever weird stuff they’re doing. I don’t even know what’s going on over there, man. It’s goofy.

This is about getting attention, right? I mean, you launch things at trade shows because the press and creators are here, and you can get a lot of attention. Razer doesn’t need help getting attention. Why still do it here?

Well, it’s an opportunity, I think, for us also to catch up with our partners, friends, and show a little bit of what we have been working on under the hood. But it’s been a tradition of sorts. I think the community expects us to be here. I’d love to see more of these in-person events right now, especially post-pandemic, and what has happened.

From a gaming perspective, we’ve also lost a couple of big events in the year. So it’s a great way to kind of kick it off. It’s a little early in the year for us, though. We wish it would be maybe mid-January or something like that. But it’s a bit of a tradition for us. I hope it continues, I hope it gets bigger along the way, and it’s massive right now. But it’s good fun.

Do you think you’re still getting the same amount of attention from this kind of thing as you would if you just had your own events?

Well, we have our own events, pretty much, but it’s a good opportunity just to catch up with partners. I think that’s been a real opportunity for us. And it’s also a good opportunity for us to kind of bring the rest of our audience along, from the gaming community, who may not necessarily be keen so much on all tech, but they really wanna see what’s the latest and greatest in gaming tech. And that’s what we do.

So let me ask you about the announcements here. There’s an AI headset called Project Motoko.

You’ve got AI PCs for software developers, which is really interesting. I wanna talk to you about that. And then there’s Project Ava, which is a spinning hologram.

Yes. We’ve got Madison also, which is a project that we’ve brought across, which showcases the latest and greatest in immersion technology. We’ve put it into a gaming chair, so that’s a setup for games.

I can’t believe I forgot the chair. The most important.

Yeah, the chair, it’s getting a lot of traction. And a whole lot more, and not just hardware, but software.

So how do you decide what is going to be a real product you’re gonna ship? The AI PCs, I think, are real products you’re definitely gonna ship. That’s just happening. And then here’s the concept, just to get attention and feedback. How do you make that kind of choice?

Actually, we’ve got a labs team internally, which charts and pretty much looks at things far out, in terms of the industry, where we think the industry’s going, and how we can build toward that. In essence, the decision to green-light a project to an actual product is really like, “Is this cool? Do we think it’s gonna do well?” We kind of started with that, with the gaming mouse, right?

We very rarely sit down with the finance people and say, “Oh, do we do projections and things like that?” It’s really more of a “by the seat of our pants” kind of thing. It’s cool, we like it, it’s gonna be fun, we want it for ourselves. I think the real kind of trigger there is, do we want it for ourselves? And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it’s cool, we’ll bring it to market.

Every year, there’s always some project; some of them come out, some of them don’t come out. One year, you announced a respirator that got you into a lot of trouble, and you had to recall the product. How do you make the call of, “Okay, this project, it’s out, it’s successful, it’s doing what we want it to do, we’re gonna keep investing,” versus “this was a one-off.” What’s the metric of success there?

Well, scaling it. I think scaling it is definitely something that we would like to do. And sometimes we’re really early. For example, I think over a decade ago we built a complete gaming PC in a handheld. For that matter, we brought it to market at the same time. Today, we’ve seen handhelds out there, and we haven’t launched our handheld, for example, at this point.

I think for us, when we launch a product, we look at the attraction for it. You know, is this something that we want? Do we wanna invest in the next generation? Do we wanna kind of provide a roadmap across to it? So we essentially work very closely with the community.

We keep talking about “for gamers, by gamers,” but we really believe in that. We’ve got a really big fan base that’s very passionate. Everyone’s got an opinion. We love hearing opinions. We’ve got social media, we chat with them often, so on and so forth. That’s what really guides us, and we really let the community guide what we build for the future.

All right, so now I have to ask you about Project Ava.

Did you say to your team, “I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk”? You say that the metric is “what we want.” Who was like, “I want this”?

Sure. So actually, yeah, somewhat. Well, not so much in the specific words, “I want an anime waifu,” and things like that. But we did hack together a holographic projector to have a character there. We had ideas like that in the past, where we’ve created holographic projectors for game companies. But back in the day, to say, “Hey, look, is there a way that we can do a holographic representation of some of your latest characters?” and stuff like that.

With AI, we were now able to get that personality there and have conversational AI coming through. I think the tipping point for us was really not just making great hardware, and not just having great software, but also, now with great intelligence, I think, coming out together with it. And it’s that premise of being able to have a semi-physical representation of an avatar, to me being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.

It’s really exciting in our imaginations for ourselves, you know? It’s cool. We’ve always had that, whether it’s a game like a super AI in Halo, like Cortana, for example. So it’s a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, “Hey, it’s a great concept,” and I think the community loves it.

Are you aware of the very common trope about actually building superintelligence from sci-fi movies? The one that’s “you should not build the Torment Nexus?”

Well, for us, I think in this case it’s more… Well, I’m familiar with that, of course.

Yeah, yeah. But, I mean, with the guardrails… That is also, I think, on a broader level, from an AI discussion and things like that, trust and safety is one of the things that we do look at internally at the company. But specifically for Ava, it was just cool. It was just awesome to be able to have a product like that, and hopefully we will.

So is Ava going to come out? Because I think that my understanding, or my reaction to this product, changes based on whether it’s actually coming out or if this is just a concept that people can react to. But you’re taking pre-orders for it. It’s like 20 bucks to pre-order it.

Yes, we’re taking reservations for it at this point in time.

We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things that we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on? We’d also like to get the feedback from many of the game partners, at the same time, to do really specific character models, so on and so forth. And then finally, I think on the trust and safety part, we also wanna make sure that we take that into consideration. Are there things that we need to know? We’re working with our model partners at the same time.

I would say that there’s a pretty significant disconnect between saying you care about trust and safety and partnering with Grok, which is in the middle of a deepfake porn scandal. As we speak, as we’re sitting here, Grok is undressing people left and right. I’m confident that we will be undressed by the end of this podcast.

Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?

Well, I think for Grok, you know… We picked Grok also because it’s got the best conversational AI at this point, for us. At least from a conversation, personality side of things, and that’s one of the things that we looked at from a tech perspective. Now, ultimately, however, we do see Ava as an open platform, right? If somebody wants to be able to use a different model, it’s one of the things that we’re taking into consideration. And we are multi-model, right? But I think from a perspective of an avatar, from a conversational AI for CES, we feel that Grok has a really great conversational AI model at this point. So that’s one of the reasons why we picked Grok.

Grok, also made by Elon Musk, who has his own anime waifu ideas, I would say. There’s something there that is, you know, not necessarily just trust and safety. The idea that you would have a pet on your desk that looks like a person, that can talk to you, that’s a big door to open for a lot of people. Are you worried about that at all?

Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi.

I think there’s a pretty big step difference between… Like my daughter has a Tamagotchi. I’m never worried that this thing is alive.

The Tamagotchi has not driven anyone into psychosis.

Sure. But from a virtual perspective, and as a gamer, we’ve interacted with NPCs and stuff like that. And of course, NPCs are getting smarter with AI, and I do hope they get smarter. It gets more engaging. And I think we’re still in the early days. Now, the question, I think, where it’s going to lead to is something that we need to discover, right? And, of course, we need to discover it in a responsible manner to figure out how we do that, and put the right guardrails in. What do we do in terms of AI, in terms of this? That’s something that we’re learning.

So building great hardware, I think, is part of it. Grok is powering this for us at this point in time, and this is something that we feel, from a conversational perspective, they do an incredible job at. Now, over and above what else can we do to ensure that, ultimately, when we do launch the product, how do we make sure that it’s going to do the right things and be able to converse and be the great companion that we want it to be?

This is very much what I mean by saying I react to it differently when it’s just a concept, and it opens the door to these conversations, versus you are going to sell this thing to people. And I think when you sell it to people, the responsibility skyrockets. We’ve all looked at what’s happened with OpenAI models over the last year or so. People have fallen in love with them. Famously, Bing proposed to journalist Kevin Roose on the front page of The New York Times. People are having relationships with these products. They are being driven to very negative outcomes.

Do you think that you have to do something else to make sure that doesn’t happen with Ava, who will be represented in human-like form on your desk? Like the opportunity to have a relationship is gonna change, right? And from what I have been told, from our reporters, Razer people are saying, “We don’t want this to be a companion in that way.” OpenAI said that about ChatGPT, and yet, here we are. So what have you learned from that already?

So we work closely with the model providers. I think this is something that we work closely on with them, with respect to that. We do talk to them often about what the plans are for the future, with respect to this. But I think what is clear is that these are still early days, right? It is still new for us to discover. I’m sure that there will be concerns or issues that will come about, and evolving what’s happening for technology is something that we do.

Now, maybe it’s even a hardware lock that we need to put in. We don’t know, right? Or it’s more software guardrails that we have to put into place at this point in time. That’s one of the reasons why we decided to put it as a concept first out there, to get the feedback. And we’re not gonna be able to think of everything, but we would like to be able to get as much thought, concern, and care into the product before we actually launch it, which is why we’ve also intentionally, in a very intentional and deliberate manner, said, “We don’t know when we’re gonna launch this.” We really do not.

I would suspect, for us, it will be a phased approach to a certain extent, with dev kits out there first to be able to discover more. Someone’s gonna be able to do more with it, perhaps, to load up different models and to have it say things that we may not necessarily want it to say, and we’ll find out. And then, accordingly, we’ll just grow the product.

I understand all this, but you’re taking the money, right? You’re taking the pre-orders. Why take pre-orders if you don’t think you’re ready?

So what we have actually said is that these are reservations. They’re not pre-orders, per se. So, ultimately, when we do launch the product, and it could be a long way out, by then, because of the specs… We have not disclosed the actual specs of the product, and even, for example, which character models, or even which model it’s gonna be running at this point in time. We’re leaving that absolutely open.

And of course, at the end of the day, if somebody says, “Look, this isn’t the product that I thought it was going to be,” that’s fine. Cancel the reservation, and we’ll remain open and see how the product evolves at that point in time.

Are you ready for a customer, a few years from now, falling in love with their hologram on your desk that you have provided?

I don’t think that’s how we would want to design the product.

That’s what happens with all these tools.

I suppose we literally do not know, right? I use the example when I play a game, and I’m really invested in the game, I really enjoy it, and I feel a sense of loss... Well, I wouldn’t call it unhappiness, but loss when I finish a game. But it’s a great game. I’m fully invested in a movie, I’m fully invested in a game. Is that how we see it? Perhaps, right?

We want to create products that people care about, whether that’s a gaming mouse, a laptop, or whatever software platforms. We want people to care about it. I don’t necessarily think that we want somebody to fall in love with one of our products and marry them. It might happen. Who knows? It could.

There are other CEOs who come on this show, they’re like, “You should marry my AI,” and straightforwardly say these things to me.

The reality is, some people are having their romantic lives rocked because a cloud service got deprecated, and then you’re gonna have to deal with that. I’m just saying, these are the questions that are coming for you once you put a character that people can have an emotional relationship with.

Well, I would say that potentially that could happen, but that’s definitely not something we plan to build the product toward. I mean, we have, for example, people really passionate about Razer products, right? Some of them have come to me, and they have said, “Look, I’m so passionate about this product, it’s part of my life. I’m gonna tattoo the product on myself,” and things like that. We didn’t plan to do that.

But we did, however, plan to make the best possible product. We put incredible amounts of care and concern, I think, in terms of design. And that’s what we plan to do with Ava at the same time, or Motoko, or Madison, or any of the products that we bring to the market.

One more question on this, and then I’m gonna ask you the Decoder questions and talk about the rest of your AI investment, which is pretty substantial. You said you’re working with the model partners, and that is how you’re thinking about trust and safety. Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety, as it relates to Grok? Because I’m looking at the product you’re shipping today, and I would say, “No.”

Sure. So I think, and I speak broadly, I think, for all of the partners that we’ve got. I think for the vast majority of all the models out there, I think there’s, of course, a lot of focus in terms of intelligence, really trying to get to that point, but trust and safety really is one of the things that pretty much all our partners really do care about. And that’s one of the reasons why… Each model, I think, excels in different ways at the same time. And I think for us, we really wanna find the best possible model. And ultimately, in what shape or form we ship at the end of the day, that’s one of the things that we will take into consideration.

Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety?

Specifically, I don’t really like to comment on that at this point in time because I don’t have enough information, I think, right now. I really don’t. My focus to date has been more in terms of what’s the best conversational model that we’ve got, and they’re great, they’re fantastic.

Again, I suspect we’ll be undressed within the next 45 minutes. They’ve got one idea, and they’re good at it.

Let me ask you the Decoder questions. If you’ve got a trick, you gotta play the hits, you know? Let me ask the Decoder questions ‘cause I think that’s gonna lead into some of the big investments you’re making, and the change that’s coming to Razer as a company over the next few years. You’re really invested in design. You’re a product designer, that’s some of your background. How is Razer structured in a way that lets you stay focused on design?

So I focus on product at the company. We’ve got a really pretty flat structure at Razer. I’ve got about 40, 50 direct reports. We really work as a team. And the entire company is really focused, I think, in terms of product first. You know, that has always been the mantra for the organization, but we’ve got a really great team, very talented team members. And everyone has worked together for a while. We’ve got team members who have been there for the last 20 years together with us, growing alongside us.

I would say that the guiding north star for us is just about the gamers. We’ve been consistent in that respect, despite the fact that in the very early days, gaming or gamers were not considered a big industry or demographic. But we’ve been laser-focused in terms of that as we’ve grown. Even with the industry growing at this point in time, the opportunities for us to go like, “Hey, why don’t you do productivity at the same time? Why don’t we go into this other area?” And stuff like that. We’ve just said, “Look, we know what we’re good at.” We remain focused on it. We align the team members all the time, and that’s how we are structured.

When I say structure, I mean literally organized. Does everybody report to you? Where do all those 2000 people go?

No. In the traditional structure, we’ve got our operations and supply chain. We’ve got legal, so on and so forth. But we’ve got a pretty flat, I think, management team structure, and we don’t have multiple layers from that perspective. And we consistently keep a very single-minded focus to say that, “Look, the product’s always the most important. The customer, in our case, the gamer, is always the most important for us.” And pretty much we ask ourselves the question, right? If there’s no direction or management mandate when it comes down to this, just figure it out. Like, what would the customer want, what would the gamer want? That’s what we do.

You’re primarily based in Singapore. I know you come back and forth a lot. Where is most of the company based?

Well, we’re everywhere. A third of our business is in the US, a third in Europe, and a third in Asia at this point in time. So we’ve got team members spread out. We’ve got close to 20 offices worldwide. We’re dual headquartered in Irvine and Singapore.

When I think about the market of gamers, we’re here, obviously, in the United States. It’s very obviously focused on what this market wants. Gaming is growing in China at a high rate, right? We’re adding more gamers in other places. When you say, “We’re focused on the gamers,” the gamers in different regions want different things. How do you make those decisions? How do you decide which needs are gonna drive your roadmaps or your design ideas?

Exactly that. You know, the gamers from, or the needs from, every country or region that we’ve got… We’ve got team members from design in each of the various regions, and we do focus on pretty much two constituents, the way that we see it. The first of which would be the game developers. That’s who we work with, very closely with. And then on the other end of the spectrum, we’ve got the gamers. And what we do is focus on what the gamers want, what the game developers want, and we see ourselves as the link in between. And we keep both as happy as we can.

This brings me to the other Decoder question I ask everybody on the show. How do you make decisions? Do you have a framework? Do you have an organized way of making decisions?

I think we are dictated by what we feel the customer wants. That’s what dictates our decisions at any point in time. We talk to the gamers, and when we say “talk to the gamers,” it could be directly through social media, it could be through our customer base, it could be through our sales and marketing team, and things like that. And anecdotally, we figure out, is this what we want? And if this is something that they are keen or passionate about, we then make the decision to say, “Okay, cool.” And we have a very quick, flexible, and… We’re very nimble, I would say, at Razer, wherein we try to do as little as possible, but to scale as fast as possible just for our customer base.

This is gonna lead me to the big decision. You have announced you’re investing $600 million into AI over the next few years. You’re gonna hire 150 AI engineers, I think. The gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms. Certainly, developers are very worried about what’s gonna happen to software development. We’ve seen game studios rocked by AI.

That’s a pretty big disconnect. Even, I think, in the announcement of the CES tag line for Razer at CES, which is, “AI is the future of gaming.” I looked at the Instagram comments. If you’re listening to the gamers, you’d be like, “Well, we’re done with this.” How are you reconciling that gap?

So, I would say that the question is, “What are we unhappy with?” When I say we, I mean us as gamers. I think we’re unhappy with generative AI slop, right? Just to put it out there. And that’s something that I’m unhappy with. Like any gamer, when I play a game, I want to be engaged, I wanna be immersed, I wanna be able to be competitive. I don’t want to be served character models with extra fingers and stuff like that, or shoddily written storylines, so on and so forth. I think for us, we’re all aligned against gen AI slop that is just churned out from a couple of prompts and stuff like that.

What we aren’t against, at least, from my perspective, are tools that help augment or support, and help game developers make great games. And I think that’s fundamentally what we are talking about at Razer, right? So if we’ve got AI tools that can help game developers QA their games faster, better, and weed out the bugs, I think, along the way, we’re all aligned, and we would love that. If we could get game developers to have the opportunity to create better, to check through typos and things like that, to create better games, I think we all want that. So I think that’s the way that we see it.

One of the things that we’re building, for example, at Razer is what we call a QA companion. So QA tends to be an expensive endeavor. Like the gamer doesn’t see it at the end of the day, but it can take up like 30 to 40 percent of the cost, or delay games for the longest time. Now, what we’ve done is create a companion, a tool that works with the human QA tester to be able to automatically fill in forms, to say, “Okay, if this is…” Say the form is a Jira ticket, to say “this is a bug that is identified, there’s a graphical bug, there’s a performance bug.” All that’s logged very quickly, so it’s sent to the developer at the same time. The developer then can go in and say, “Okay, this is how I’ll fix the bug,” or, “These are suggestions on how I fix the bug.”

The way that we see it is that AI is a tool to help game developers make better games. In this case, rather than replacing human creativity — and that’s something I personally feel very passionately about — we want to figure out how we use AI in the gaming industry to get AI to do things better. In the broader scheme of things, I think that’s what we have been focused on. But there are other reasons why I think gamers are unhappy with AI, and I agree with them. I don’t like slop either, right? That’s one. Two, is it raising the cost of RAM? It is also raising the cost of RAM. I don’t like that at the same time.

Back in the day, there was the GPUs versus crypto situation and things like that, and this is the same thing. So I do think, however, that all gamers would love better games, more fun games, more engaging games, and if AI can help create that by doing better QA, I mean, I’m all for it.

I want to poke at that a little bit harder, but let me just ask you: is Razer feeling the RAM crunch and the GPU crunch like everybody else?

Oh, yes, absolutely. Because we make laptops and things like that.

I mean, we haven’t announced the prices for the next round of laptops, for example, and this is something that concerns me because the RAM prices are going up, and we want to be able to make sure our laptops remain affordable and within the reach of gamers out there. But it has been moving. It is such a volatile situation at this point in time that it’s hard for us to even figure out what the pricing is at this junction.

Do you think you’ll be able to pick a number and be confident in that number by the time the laptops have to come out?

I don’t know if I can pick a number right now as I speak with you, and by the end of the podcast.

You have competitors in the PC industry like Apple, Microsoft, and others. They can move their margins around. They have services, businesses, and stuff that attach to these laptops. Maybe they’ll take a hit on the RAM because you’re gonna have to pay for iCloud for the rest of your life, or whatever it is you’re gonna do. You don’t have that kind of secondary business. Is that more of a danger to you?

Well, we do have a secondary business of sorts. So hardware is a big part of our business. We actually have a services payments business where we do payments for a lot of the game companies out there, and that’s one of the strategies that we use to try to make our products more available to everyone. That’s the way that we kind of see it.

We are an ecosystem of sorts. We do great hardware, I think, for game developers and the gamers out there. But we’ve got a software platform that we are able to bring across to all the gamers out there. And of course, it’s a services business at the same time. But the RAM situation, at the end of the day, is still an evolving situation right now.

Do you think it will cap out, and do you think we’ll have enough data center capacity, and things will go back to normal?

Is there a point at which the price of RAM, or the price of a marginal Nvidia GPU, becomes too high for you to sustainably do laptops at your scale?

I would say I’m hoping that it doesn’t come to that, right? I think, in short, we’ve seen this happen with the industry multiple times in the past, spiked in terms of pricing. What’s great is that as long as manufacturing kicks in, and we are able to kind of keep up, it’s just economics at the end of the day. There is a spike in terms of pricing. We believe that at some point it will come down. What goes up must come down, and what goes down at some point goes up, too.

Let me come back to what you’re saying about AI and development. AI is the future of gaming. You’ve announced products here, and we’ve talked about Ava, the headset with the cameras and the AI stuff in it. That’s consumer AI products, right? Those are consumer products. And you’re saying your bet is on AI helping developers make better games faster. There’s a gap there, right?

AI is the future of gaming is an all-encompassing tag line. It means a lot of things to a lot of people, but it sounds like your bet is very specifically in sort of the more enterprise side of the house, helping developers do games better. Is it correct that it’s much narrower than what people are perceiving?

Well, I think the tag line’s very broad, but it’s easier to do a catchier tag line when it’s a broad tag line, as opposed to when it’s hardware we look at or software and stuff like that. But in short, for us, we run an ecosystem. We’ve got hardware, we’ve got software with services. Starting with the hardware, I think we do see that AI is going to be part of the whole kind of conversation. The way that we look at it would be things like whether it’s AI companions, or whether it’s making smart headphones, like with Motoko. We see all of this as augmenting what’s happening today, not replacing it.

So it’s not a gen AI conversation that we’ve got. It’s about how we bring the smarts, where we design products, and how we bring additional value to our users. For example, using our gaming headphones, all of a sudden, we can provide additional AI capabilities. Is that great? Absolutely. So, that’s one of the things that we’re looking at from a hardware perspective.

Now, from a software and services perspective, as we work with the game developers and publishers, and so on and so forth, we look at additional tools that can make their games better. We can work closely with them on a QA companion basis, for example. And then some of these core technologies, as we provide for them, can then make better games, over and above. So I believe that at some point, it’s not just games, but AI is just gonna be so prevalent or ubiquitous that every single vertical, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, is gonna have some elements of AI there. And we are just going along with it.

I’ve heard this pitch a lot, and I have a lot of reactions to it. But I guess the simplest way of asking this question is, what have you seen that makes the bet worth it? Because I’ve evaluated a lot of these AI products, the merch team has reviewed a ton of them. We have literally just tried to do the things that Microsoft says you can do in the ads, and the products don’t work. Right? There’s this massive gap between what everyone says is gonna happen, or should be happening, and what is actually happening in the products.

You know, to be a cynic about it for the sake of getting a laugh out of this audience, I will tell you the products are best at convincing you that you should love them, and doing crimes, and they’re not so good at identifying what’s on your screen and helping you get a task done. They are really good at that in the domain of software development, right?

I can see why you’re pushing there with game developers. It’s obvious that Claude Code has ushered in some kind of revolution, and Cursor has ushered in some kind of revolution. In your vertical, you have something to offer that is different. But in the broad sense, this belief that it’s all just gonna happen, I think, has come up against the reality of what the products can do today. So what have you seen that suggests we will overcome that gap that makes you so confident?

Well, occasionally I go on podcasts where the guy is more concerned that someone’s gonna fall in love with my product in the long run. And I think maybe there’s something there. No, but you see, it’s early days. It could completely be the worst possible idea. It could completely go off the rails and become off the spectrum, where it’s just the most phenomenal product that somebody completely falls in love with, so on and so forth, right? And I think the reality is gonna be something in between. The way that we see it, it’s probably closer to bringing more value to people, and that’s what we want to be able to do.

We want to be able to get to the point where AI is going to be helpful to all customers, all users. And that’s also one good example where, at CES… I was just looking at some of the stats, and they said, “What’s the biggest buzz at CES?” And there were a lot, like Ava, Motoko, and things like that. And for what it’s worth, we’ve literally just put vision capabilities, audio capabilities on a headphone, and combined it with AI. It’s not a quantum leap from a hardware design perspective, but it has captured so much imagination at this point in time. People are going, “Oh, wow. Now I can bring AI on the go with me at any point in time.” It’s truly something revolutionary at this juncture. So the way that we see it, and maybe that’s something that–

Can we just hit pause on that? What specifically do you think is revolutionary about having the AI and the cameras in the headphones with you all the time?

Well, I would say that, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.

I think the whole industry is looking for this one factor, right? This is like when I hear about the platform shift, you suddenly had this massive input device paradigm shift, right? We’re going from touchscreens or mice to voice and vision. I get that. No one has sorted out that form factor, so your bet is headphones.

Our bet is on headphones in the sense that we don’t necessarily have to retrain human beings as a whole with an entirely new form factor. And so I don’t have to change any behavior of sorts. Boom, tomorrow we can get you AI smarts immediately. And that, I think, is the promise. There’s a disconnect today with the possibility of AI and what it could be, and that’s where we see ourselves as designers, having that responsibility, or the opportunity, so to speak, to be able to design in such a way that we don’t necessarily have to change the entire behavior.

For what it’s worth, in the very early days, it could be, for that matter, a mouse. It’s just a mouse. Why is a mouse so important that today we’ve brought it from a mouse all the way to a gaming mouse, and now the gaming mouse is a broader category than productivity, right? Gaming mice right now dominate the mouse category at this point in time. And right now, we can call it a smart headphone, and that’s the way we see it. We don’t necessarily have to retrain everybody to say, “Oh, you’ve gotta put on glasses. You’ve gotta be able to bear with the weight,” and things like that.

So that is one of the things that we’re doing with Motoko, and a lot of the work that we do is actually on the software side of things, right? How do we ensure that we get context faster? How do we ensure that we are able to do all of that? So it’s both hardware/software fusion and a sense of fusion at the same time, that we are really focused on in terms of bringing the experience over. That’s something that we believe is the reason why people go, “Oh, I absolutely get it, right now, why I would want something like that.”

So the model in the Motoko that I saw is ChatGPT.

Why’d you pick ChatGPT for the headphones and Grok for Ava?

So, ChatGPT for the headphones was primarily more from the premise that we think it’s a good assistant, in terms of CV capabilities, identifying things, and being able to give very quick feedback at the same time. But it could very well run Grok also at the same time. And the way that we are kind of presenting this is that whether it’s for Ava, or whether it’s for Motoko, or any of our other products, we are multi-model.

That was one of the things that we wanted to be able to do. We believe that at some point in time, you see Gemini doing really well. We see Grok doing really, really well. We see ChatGPT having advances in various aspects. This race to intelligence is just great for all of us as consumers, right? When I mention that Grok has great conversational AI, I think it is the best for conversational AI at this point in time. ChatGPT’s doing great, I think, in terms of it as an assistant, for reasoning and things like that. And that’s what we see ourselves. We see ourselves as owning the vertical from a gaming perspective, being able to work with all the best intelligence or the AI out there, and then bringing and designing a product or service tailored for our users, and within the gaming vertical.

So the vision is that I’m wearing headphones that have cameras, microphones, and speakers. I’m walking through the airport, and I’m just asking it, “Where is my gate?” and it’s telling me the answer from ChatGPT. Or is it more that I’m sitting at my desk playing a game and it’s helping me through the game?

All of the above. You can literally do that with Motoko at this point in time.

But this is what I mean about the capability gap. I think if I walk through the airport and I ask ChatGPT where my gate is, it would not get that right at this point in time. Like, there’s a model capability gap there.

I believe that if you use ChatGPT today and you’re providing snapshots with some context, like, let’s say, location, to a certain extent, you could. I would be messaging on my phone with ChatGPT, for example, and it could give me the reasoning to be able to bring me there, to a great extent. I’ll give an example, right? I would literally use ChatGPT for a whole bunch of day-to-day tasks and stuff like that. It’s got great reasoning; it’s able to do that. And now we are layering on vision capabilities, and that’s just another level of input.

Over and above, we’ve got far-field microphones. So audio capabilities also come to bear. With all of this, we’re able to give a lot more information across to ChatGPT, which does all the reasoning, I think, for us. And that’s where we see it coming through. So constantly, the smart or intelligence is part of how we see us designing AI hardware, at this point in time.

It seems like you have a pretty big reliance on the models themselves, right? You’re obviously not training your own models. You wanna be multi-model, you wanna let people choose. Are you thinking of yourself more as being the best at the hardware, the form factor, and having the best microphones and cameras, and that will let people use the models more conveniently?

Well, we are an ecosystem, but I think for gamers. It’s not just, I think, in terms of the hardware, but most of our work is actually done at the software side. If I use CES as an example, if I’ve got Ava, when I wake up, it’s giving me information like what’s happening in the day and what my day is gonna be today, so on and so forth. When I get out of my apartment, and I go out into the street, to the subway, et cetera, then I’ve got Motoko at the same time. But with persistent memory, it will know exactly what has been happening in the home. Ava is somewhat following me everywhere in my day. I’m not gonna fall in love with it yet.

But in short, it’s following my day, I’m going around, I’m looking at it, I’m asking for directions. When I get to the office, I could literally still be with Motoko, which is another form factor. So the way that we see it is that the intelligence is persistent, and it follows you. The form factors that are presented are hardware form factors. It’s a little bit like how we’ve designed our product at this point in time. We have a singular software platform where we are able to give you a great gaming experience, over and above. You could be using one of our mice, our keyboards, and so on and so forth, a laptop. These are just representations, at the end of the day. And that’s how we designed it, and there are particular problems that we need to solve that the models don’t provide for us. You know, context.

So that’s one of the things that our AI scientists do really well. We’ve got advanced retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we’ve got context, and we really focus on that. Persistent memory is something that we are very good at, at the same time. And these are fundamental problems that AI scientists need to solve. These are the things that our team does, so we work with the best models out there. And we also have the capabilities of creating physical representations, and that’s something that we’ve got a huge advantage at.

Doesn’t a lot of the value here just accrue back to these models? And yet, even if you’re building all this stuff above the models and around the models to make them work the way you want, it seems like, “Okay, my Ava is gonna be powered by ChatGPT no matter what.” If I want that unified experience, I’m just kind of, at the end of the day, talking to an instantiation of ChatGPT all day long, right?

Because then I have Grok over here and ChatGPT in the headphones, you can’t unify that. So at the end of the day, it’s all Gemini, or whatever model I choose. So, can you provide enough value to charge a premium on top of the ChatGPT subscription to make that work?

So that’s, I think, where our angle is, from the software perspective. We believe that we can bring enough value of persistence across to the user, and progressively we will see even more users who will say, “Look, this is what I want, to be able to go from one model to another,” for example. Or if I’m happy with just a single model, and if I’m a techie and I’m happy to just go directly and play around with it, we provide that open platform. So being open is one of the things that we truly believe in.

One of the things you notice when you cover AI enough is the idea that the AI startups are just wrappers on OpenAI, and then eventually OpenAI will just eat them as the models get more incapable. We’ve seen that play out already a little bit.

You obviously have hardware. Razer’s a different business, but you can see that dynamic here, where the core model capability might start to get the memory you’re talking about, where the core model capability might start to get the persistent personality across devices that you’re talking about. OpenAI is making hardware, we are told. There’s a competition with the core provider that is coming in different dimensions. How are you thinking about that?

Well, I think the entire tech industry has always been wrappers, for that matter, not necessarily from an AI perspective, but it’s the question of when you build a wrapper, do you provide enough value from the wrapper that you build? And that’s the thing, where it’s also very hard for anyone to be all things to all people. And I don’t think OpenAI wants to be all things to all people. I don’t think Grok wants to be all things to all people.

For us, we tend to be very focused on our vertical. We are not tempted to try to produce something else different at any point in time. And our vertical is really for the gamers. This is something we’ve got huge domain knowledge in terms of what the gamers want, what the game developers want. We’ve got distribution; we’ve got about 70,000 game developers using our SDK. We’ve got 150 million gamers on our software platform. We’ve got distribution, I think, across to that. Can the models go out there and try to build the distribution? Yes, but do they prefer to partner?

And I think the answer is they do prefer to partner. Fundamentally, we have a huge amount of data, I think, on the gamers, their preferences, what they want, what they like, and that we can bring that across to the models at the same time, which is our IP, for that matter. I think with that in mind, as I say, having all these verticals, you may call it building wrappers of sorts, but these are very deep wrappers that we have to build. A lot of customization, a lot of building, and it’s more than just hardware, right? It’s not hardware.

As I say, the hardware is just part of the equation. It’s the software part that we need to do. It’s the R and D work that we need to do, for example, to get persistence in this space and context. So to get the context for our users, that’s where our data comes in at the same time, to be able to kind of pivot and focus on that.

I think one of the reasons people like companies like Razer, and like dealing with products that Razer makes, is that you just buy them and you’re done. Like you can just buy the mouse, and then you own it, and it’s fine. You can just buy the laptop. I’m not in an ongoing subscription relationship with you, unless I want to be.

One of your competitors, Hanneke Faber from Logitech, came on the show a year or two ago, and she was like, “I wanna build a forever mouse,” and what she meant was a subscription mouse, and she’s never coming back on the show again, I think, based on the reaction to that. That’s my understanding of how they felt about that interview.

All the things you’re talking about are ongoing relationships, ongoing development costs. I hear it, and I hear the promise. I also hear, “I’m gonna have to pay a fee every month.” Like this is where that comes from. You need to pay the developers, you need to pay for cloud uptime to make the AI system alive. How much are you gonna charge for all of that?

Well, we’ve always had an ongoing relationship with our customer. That’s the thing, right? The way that we see it from Razer is that when somebody buys a Razer mouse, they tend to buy another Razer mouse in the future. They expand the devices that they own from us. So we’ve always had a long-term relationship with our customer, from that perspective. At some point in time, as we think through the whole AI uptime, so on and so forth… I mean, we’ve had cloud costs also in the past, maintaining profiles in clouds. For us, I think that’s one of the things that we want to figure out. What can we do to ensure that we bring value?

I think that’s our obsession. If there is no value, our customers won’t pay for it, we won’t pay for it ourselves, right? So to that end, that’s our focus, I think, in respect of it. And it could be through… We build into the hardware cost, for that matter, if that makes sense, and I’ll be candid: We have literally not thought through this in great detail. But the way that we see it is, how do we identify that value to the user? And from there we are very clear, we message this. This is the value that we see out of this, and we’ll let the market decide.

I look at that reaction from gamers, probably, to AI in the industry. There’s slop. I think there’s a lot of reaction to slop, and there’s a lot of reaction to game studios being in whatever amount of crisis the game studios appear to be in. There’s whatever reaction to consolidation. And then there’s the relentless fee seeking from the games industry, that everything is gonna be a subscription, everything is gonna be free to play with DLC, everything is gonna be an ongoing, recurring cost, over and over and over again.

The industry’s really moved to that model across the board, and I think people are feeling that pain. So then they hear AI, and they say, “Okay, someone else is gonna ask me for 10 bucks a month, or 20 bucks a month.” Can you avoid that? Can you just price it into the hardware? Is that going to be inevitable?

So, as I mentioned, I don’t know if we’re gonna price it into the hardware. We are still figuring it out. But I would say that, at the end of the day, the question is how much value are you getting on it, right? I mean, I pay for Spotify because I see the value in paying for Spotify. I get a whole library of music, and so on, and with Xbox Game Pass, so on and so forth.

There are times when I would prefer... I mean, I look back, and I go like, “Oh, I wish I could just pay one time for this title.” There are microtransactions, there are subscription fees. But at the end of the day, I think, myself as a consumer, myself as a gamer, I would say… I would just look at anything. I would say if it’s worth that amount of money to me, I would pay for it. Otherwise, I’ll vote with my wallet. That’s the way I see it.

Are you seeing signs that the AI stuff is gonna be worth paying for that way? I mean, this is the bubble. We’re gonna spend all this money, we’ll forward invest in all this infrastructure. We’re gonna skyrocket the price of RAM and GPUs, and then at the end of the day, people are going to say, “That’s not actually worth the 20 bucks a month.”

I don’t necessarily see it as AI, per se, but I see the kind of value that I get out of it. So, for example, a ChatGPT subscription, or a Grok subscription, for that matter. I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it. And that’s the way I see it. I don’t see myself as paying for AI, per se. I see it as what am I getting out of a chatbot, for example, that can advise me on travel matters, health matters, whatever it is, my day-to-day, and stuff like that. Is that worth 20 bucks to me?

I’m just saying, the marginal cost is meaningless to you.

20 bucks is still 20 bucks, that’s right.

I think for a lot of people, that is meaningful, especially stacked on top of all the other money they pay. Basically, I’m saying, do you see that critique of AI as a bubble? That the investment has not yet delivered the value that will make it so obvious that the investment’s worth it?

So I see that. I mean, huge amounts of investments are going into it. We are investing in AI, I think, as we speak. But I do see the potential at this point. In many cases, I mean, look at the number of paid subscribers for ChatGPT, for example. People do see the value in terms of whether it’s a chatbot AI, so on and so forth. I do think the potential is going to be realized.

Now, in many cases, I think there will be AI slop. I mean, I’ve paid for subscriptions that, at the start, I thought were gonna be great, but I’ve canceled them. But I do believe that in many cases, and in some cases that we have not even envisaged yet, the potential will be realized.

Let me ask you broadly, I mean, you obviously talk a lot to game developers. You and I actually were just talking backstage about the nature of art in the age of AI, and the nature of craft. That industry is going through an enormous amount of turmoil right now. What do you think the outcome looks like? What do you think makes that all feel good at the end?

I would say that the outcome that we see, and I think it’s gonna be the likely outcome, is that AI tools are gonna be helping human developers develop faster and better. And I think that’s the natural outcome, where we’re talking about graduating, whether it’s an analog kind of way of creating art versus digital. And I think it’s gonna be the same thing.

We’re going to see human artists use AI tools to kind of really bring their vision to life. We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout. So that’s, I think, what’s going to happen, where we will see even more human creators, now with the help of more tools.

Maybe I’m an optimist, but I really, truly see that AI tools will come to fall, because at some point in time, we’re going to see so much slop out there that we’re going to crave for really great art, really great design. And that’s what’s gonna happen. We’ve seen a cycle go over and over and over again.

So, with the amount of slop out there, we’re going to see some level of art rise to the top, and that kind of art may still be created with the same tools that created the slop, but with great care, with great discernment, to be able to do something truly different. The difference will come from human ingenuity, not from countless prompt mashing, so to speak.

So I feel like I have to ask you this now. What games are you playing right now?

What meets the bar? I play a lot of single-player games at this point in time, like Civilization and stuff like that. I still do a lot of that. I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre. So things like that.

You just named genres. What games are you playing that meet the bar?

You’re talking about human ingenuity and creativity. What games are you playing right now that meet the bar?

Oh, well, I play random stuff. If you’re talking about human ingenuity… I even play some of the Roblox games at this point in time, right? But a lot of the games, and maybe I talked broadly in terms of genres primarily because I appreciate the human ingenuity that’s gone into the genres themselves.

One hundred people dropped on an island with a circle that comes through. I mean, while I enjoy the game itself, I also appreciate the mechanics, the thought that has gone into them, and the premise that the designer has figured out. In PUBG, for example, it’s this primal instinct of humans to be the last man standing, so to speak. So it’s things like that that I appreciate, and I think it’s art.

Okay. What’s next for Razer? What should people be looking for?

More of the same, I would say, in the sense. When I say more of the same, I’d say nothing has changed from day one for us, and that has always been our mantra. And we used to say, all the time, that the mantra for us… Our “for gamers, by gamers” mantra has really followed us from day one, where the gaming industry didn’t really exist as an industry, even the hardware industry or software, and so on and so forth.

We believe that we’ve designed products for ourselves that we enjoy, that I enjoy using at any point in time, and that tomorrow, when the gaming industry grows dramatically, we will still be focused on games. Even though there are multiple opportunities for us to kind of expand out there. And even now, when we talk about the gaming industry in somewhat of a doldrums at this juncture, I believe that we’re gonna see the next great genre come through, right? Whether it’s MMOs in the early days, MOBAs, and then battle royales, we’re gonna see the next great genre. We’re hoping to see Grand Theft Auto VI at some point in time, right?

So all that, we look forward to, but we’re just pretty much laser-focused. It’s just that the demographic has really changed. The word gamer has also changed through the years. The games have changed through the years, right? For us, we’re just sitting here, very focused, and designing great products for ourselves.

Min, this has been great. Thank you so much for joining us on Decoder.

Seletti, an Italian design brand known for everything from furniture to tableware, has debuted an unusual tribute to an icon of design: the Bic Cristal pen. To celebrate its 75th anniversary, Seletti has supersized the pen and replaced its ink cartridge with a long LED-filled tube to illuminate your living room, office, or that closet where they keep all the stationery at work.

The Bic Lamp, as it’s simply called, was introduced at the 2026 Maison&Objet show in Paris – think CES, but for interior designers. Seletti says it was created at a 12:1 scale, which makes it just shy of six feet long given the Bic Cristal pen typically measures around 5.8 inches with its cap. Aside from its larger dimensions and the LED tube producing up 2,400 lumens of light, the Bic Lamp is a near identical clone, in red, black, and blue color options.

You can hang it from a ceiling as a pendant lamp but Mario Paroli also designed the Bic Lamp to mount to a wall or stand alone as a floor lamp. It will launch in the US later this year where it’s expected to cost $350, according to Fast Company.

The company is reportedly exiting the Android market.

Asus chairman Jonney Shih told Taiwan’s Inside that the company is done making phones for now, marking the end of its Zenfone and ROG Phone lines.

“Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future,” Shih reportedly said (translated with Google Translate). He didn’t entirely rule out a return though, instead saying the company is entering a state of “indefinite observation” of the market, and that it will “continue to take care of the brand’s mobile phone users.”

Asus’s own-brand phones haven’t been particularly exciting since the teeny-tiny Zenfone 10 in 2023, though its ROG Phone line has more or less been the gold standard for premium gaming phones. It only released two phones in 2025, the big but boring Zenfone 12 Ultra and the ROG Phone 9 FE. Neither came out in the US.

We’ve reached out to Asus for confirmation that it is exiting the smartphone market, but hadn’t heard back in time for publication.

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/games/863747/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-3-0-switch-2-quality-of-life">Visit Original Website</a>

Quality-of-life tweaks, strafing, and a hotel make the 3.0 update worth checking out.

Animal Crossing has always been anti-instant gratification. By design, you have to take your time, wait for days to pass in real time, and complete a seemingly endless list of chores to build a meaningful life with your animal friends. The slowness is part of its appeal. But with New Horizons, some of that slowness became tedious: crafting its many items one at a time, painstakingly building cliffs and rivers by hand, picking up and placing objects one by one.

As I gathered when I previewed it last month, the newly released, free 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons addresses those issues with quality-of-life fixes that still fit the spirit of Animal Crossing. It’s a small update in terms of content — there’s just enough here to give you a reason to revisit the game if you’ve been looking for one, and not much more than that — but major in reducing friction where there wasn’t meant to be any.

Separately, there’s also the new Switch 2 Edition, which noticeably improves New Horizons’ performance and ups its resolution. Otherwise, it doesn’t add anything that important — but for $4.99, it doesn’t really have to.

The main appeal of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is the performance upgrade. On the original Switch, New Horizons would start to struggle as you placed more and more decorations around your island, sometimes to the point of severe frame rate drops. It meant that building out your island could also make it progressively less playable. My island is a pretty bare construction zone, so when I downloaded the Switch 2 upgrade, I visited several highly decorated Dream Addresses to test it out.

Anecdotally, I can say that there’s a significant improvement in how New Horizons runs, at least to my eye. All the Dream Addresses I visited were so busy with decor, from thickets of trees to loads of furniture covered in custom designs, that there were completely inaccessible areas — and I didn’t see any significant lag or choppiness like I’d expect on the original Switch version. It’s a boon for maximalist decorators, especially those of us who still want our islands to be functional amid chaotic and cluttered builds.

For me, that alone is worth the $5 upgrade. (If you don’t own the game already, the Switch 2 version is $65 to the original Switch’s $60.) Otherwise, the Switch 2 Edition doesn’t add anything you need to have. Nintendo did show a side-by-side comparison of the game’s improved resolution in the trailer for the upgrade, but I didn’t really notice the difference (with the caveat that simple visual fidelity is not particularly important to me in most games). The new megaphone, which lets you use the Switch 2’s microphone to call the names of villagers and locate them, didn’t work well for me; I saw Fuchsia, walked a short distance away so she was out of frame, and called her name, but got no reply.

And then there are the Joy-Con mouse controls, which are available when decorating interiors, creating custom designs, and writing messages on the bulletin board. I’m sure there’s someone out there who will find the mouse controls useful or intuitive, but I am not that person. First of all, I originally played this game on a tiny Switch Lite screen and I’m really enjoying this new world of playing it on a TV, so forgoing my Pro Controller to slide the right Joy-Con around on my couch cushions is not a compelling proposition. But I also found that the sensitivity of the mouse controls actually made it harder for me to be precise about item placement.

The free 3.0 update, which is available on both the Switch and the Switch 2, feels like the bigger upgrade on the merits of the quality-of-life tweaks alone. I wrote last month that this update might actually get me to finish decorating my island, and I’ve already spent hours doing exactly that.

The most impactful change is one so minor, it wasn’t even called out in the update’s announcement trailer: you can strafe.

Before, when you were decorating or terraforming or even gardening, you’d have to constantly reorient yourself. If you were building a cliff while facing north, for example, you’d have to build one block of the cliff, move a little bit to the right, then turn to face north again without accidentally walking too far north and missing your mark. I would usually do a little circle to position myself and make sure I was aiming the tool in the right place, and even then, I’d frequently be a little bit off and accidentally destroy the bit of cliffside I’d just built. It was so awkward and clunky that I cleared out my entire island in order to redesign it and then… stopped playing the game for four years.

Now, you can press L and your character will hop into place in the grid, and while holding L, you can move in any direction without changing the direction you’re facing. You still have to do all your terraforming by hand, but the process has been completely streamlined. Press L to line yourself up, build the cliff, move one space over to build the next piece. That’s it. I’ve used it to build and destroy cliffs and rivers, dig up rows of plants, lay down new paths, and even count how many spaces in the invisible grid I would need for a particular project. I’m actually having fun with construction now that the act of doing it isn’t a massive pain.

On top of that, Resetti is here to help you clean up your island in what’s possibly the only process in this game that can be described as instantaneous. He can “reset” the entire island, just the beaches, or individual areas you walk to and designate for him, sending the furniture to your storage so long as you have room. (And you will have room, since there are two new storage upgrades to unlock with a new max of 9,000 items.) I used his services to instantly pick up and put away the dozens of copies of the “wheat field” furniture item I’d used to decorate a rural area of my island, which I’d wanted to change but didn’t have the willpower to do manually.

Plants can now be stored, which allowed me to finally dig up and put away a bunch of bushes that were in my way. And while Resetti doesn’t clean up trees, bushes, or planted crops, he does pick up and put away flowers (or he’ll throw them away if you ask), which in my case saved me from what would’ve been an hour or more of digging up and moving flowers around. Resetti is now my best friend.

The 3.0 update is a designer’s dream, really. And it’s mostly thanks to those small changes and additions; the new Slumber Island feature, with which you can create up to three separate islands in a dream world, is a sandbox for hardcore decorators to play around in without having to demolish their main islands after all this time.

Outside of that, the new content is mostly just an excuse to revisit the game, rather than anything as groundbreaking as, you know, strafing. The main addition is a hotel on the pier. It isn’t novel; you’re tasked with decorating some hotel rooms, it introduces a handful of new furniture and clothing items to collect, and the hotel itself attracts tourists to your island to provide a bit of variety. It feels like an extension of the 2021 Happy Home Paradise DLC, which I really enjoyed.

A few days ago, some of my islanders informed me it had been three years and 11 months since I’d spoken to them. At that time, I really didn’t think I’d be back. But with the hotel, 3.0 gave me just enough of an excuse to return to New Horizons, and the quality-of-life updates are giving me a reason to stay a while.

Elon Musk’s platform still dominates for daily web visits.

After launching almost three years ago, Meta’s Threads is now reportedly attracting more daily mobile users than rival platform X. According to Similarweb data shared by TechCrunch, Threads has 141.5 million daily active iOS and Android global app users as of January 7th, compared to 125 million users for Elon Musk’s mobile platform.

Similarweb reports that Threads actually overtook X sometime between late October and early November after a consistent period of growth, meaning this milestone wasn’t suddenly achieved in reaction to recent Grok-related controversies. X still has more mobile users than Threads in the US, according to Similarweb, but notes that Threads is catching up, and that X has half as many daily active mobile users in the US now as it did last year.

Web traffic is another story, however. As of January 13th, X was attracting 145.4 million daily web visitors, compared to just 8.5 million on Threads. Meta may have won the mobile battle, according to these new estimates, but with only 150 million daily users combined, it has an uphill struggle to catch up with X’s more than 270 million.

            <div id="article-text">These eldritch horrors presented a mundane community radio updates are the best of fiction podcasting.

These eldritch horrors presented a mundane community radio updates are the best of fiction podcasting.

It’s relatively rare for a podcast to last 14 years, especially a fiction one. In fact, as far as I can tell, Welcome to Night Vale is the longest continually running fiction podcast out there. (Some will argue it’s actually We’re Alive, but that has taken a few significant breaks between seasons.) The story of Night Vale, the titular desert town, now spans 12 seasons, over 280 episodes, three books, and at least 10 live standalone shows. While dedicating several hundred hours of your life to listening to every episode might seem like a big ask, I believe you’ll be hooked once you dive in.

The show is written by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor, who draw heavily on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. Every season has its own arc, but broadly, the show tells the story of a town that exists in an alternate version of Earth. In this town Angels are real, but acknowledging their existence is illegal; librarians are dangerous creatures with “thousands of spiny legs” and “pincers”; and there is a Faceless Old Woman who secretly lives in your home.

These are clearly unsettling concepts when taken at face value. But rather than trying to scare the listener, Cranor and Fink lean into the natural absurdity of cosmic horror and refuse to take themselves too seriously. They also routinely subvert the bigotry of their inspiration, using Lovecraftian creations to tell stories rich with LGBTQ+ characters.

Of course, having well-written scripts and telling a compelling story is only part of the equation. What elevates Welcome to Night Vale to true greatness is the cast, especially narrator Cecil Baldwin, who plays the host of the central radio show, Cecil Palmer. Cecil’s voice has the gravitas to tell ominous stories of secretive government agencies and ancient gods. But he has the range to deliver light-hearted banter with a sentient patch of haze (her name is Deb, in case you were wondering).

Cecil Baldwin has the charisma to make even the reading of a repair manual for a toaster compelling. He can be creepy, funny, or soothing, often all within the same episode. (For this reason, I don’t suggest listening to Night Vale at night. I have fallen asleep to the dulcet sounds of Baldwin’s voice several times, only for the more unsettling parts of the show to make their way into my dreams.)

Every episode also features a musical interlude in the guise of “The Weather.” The show mostly features lesser-known artists, but alumni include Jason Isbell, The Mountain Goats, Waxahatchee, Angel Olsen, Open Mike Eagle, and Sylvan Esso.

Welcome to Night Vale is also a great way to introduce younger listeners to horror. I would never suggest my eight-year-old read H.P. Lovecraft. Partly because the man’s unrepentant racism is baked into the very fabric of his stories, but also because the violence is often too much for children. Night Vale, on the other hand, takes those horrors and exposes them for what they are: entertainment. I can put the podcast on, bond with my kid over their burgeoning love of all things creepy and weird, and trust that they’ll walk away with a good message.

Welcome to Night Vale is available on most podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Pocketcasts, YouTube, and Spotify.

Just before Christmas the Trump administration dramatically escalated its war on digital rights by banning five people from entering the US. One of them, Josephine Ballon, is a director of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. The organization is a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, and so finds itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject these accusations. Ballon told us that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. But their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. Read the full story.

Chatbots are skilled at crafting sophisticated dialogue and mimicking empathetic behavior. They never get tired of chatting. It’s no wonder, then, that so many people now use them for companionship—forging friendships or even romantic relationships. 72% of US teenagers have used AI for companionship, according to a study from the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But while chatbots can provide much-needed emotional support and guidance for some people, they can exacerbate underlying problems in others—especially vulnerable people or those with mental health issues.

Although some early attempts to regulate this space are underway, AI companionship is going nowhere.

It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling.

Gavesh’s journey started, seemingly innocently, with a job ad on Facebook promising work he desperately needed.

Instead, he found himself trafficked into a business commonly known as “pig butchering”—a form of fraud in which scammers form close relationships with targets online and extract money from them. The Chinese crime syndicates behind the scams have netted billions of dollars, and they have used violence and coercion to force their workers, many of them trafficked like Gavesh, to carry out the frauds from large compounds, several of which operate openly in the quasi-lawless borderlands of Myanmar.

Big Tech may hold the key to breaking up the scam syndicates—if these companies can be persuaded or compelled to act. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today marks an inflection point for enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in generative AI, only 5% of integrated pilots deliver measurable business value and nearly one in two companies abandons AI initiatives before reaching production.

The bottleneck is not the models themselves. What’s holding enterprises back is the surrounding infrastructure: Limited data accessibility, rigid integration, and fragile deployment pathways prevent AI initiatives from scaling beyond early LLM and RAG experiments. In response, enterprises are moving toward composable and sovereign AI architectures that lower costs, preserve data ownership, and adapt to the rapid, unpredictable evolution of AI—a shift IDC expects 75% of global businesses to make by 2027.

AI pilots almost always work, and that’s the problem. Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.

“PoCs live inside a safe bubble” observes Cristopher Kuehl, chief data officer at Continent 8 Technologies. Data is carefully curated, integrations are few, and the work is often handled by the most senior and motivated teams.

The result, according to Gerry Murray, research director at IDC, is not so much pilot failure as structural mis-design: Many AI initiatives are effectively “set up for failure from the start.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was early evening in Berlin, just a day before Christmas Eve, when Josephine Ballon got an unexpected email from US Customs and Border Protection. The status of her ability to travel to the United States had changed—she’d no longer be able to enter the country.

At first, she couldn’t find any information online as to why, though she had her suspicions. She was one of the directors of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. As the organization has become a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, it has increasingly found itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship.

It was only later that she saw what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had posted on X:

For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.Today, @StateDept will take steps toâ€¦

Rubio was promoting a conspiracy theory about what he has called the “censorship-industrial complex,” which alleges widespread collusion between the US government, tech companies, and civil society organizations to silence conservative voices—the very conspiracy theory HateAid has recently been caught up in.

Then Undersecretary of State Sarah B. Rogers posted on X the names of the people targeted by travel bans. The list included Ballon, as well as her HateAid co-director, Anna Lena von Hodenberg. Also named were three others doing similar or related work: former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who had helped author Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA); Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which documents hate speech on social media platforms; and Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, which provides risk ratings warning advertisers about placing ads on websites promoting hate speech and disinformation.

It was an escalation in the Trump administration’s war on digital rights—fought in the name of free speech. But EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject the accusations of censorship. Ballon, von Hodenberg, and some of their clients tell me that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. And their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. They almost certainly won’t be the last people targeted in this way.

Ballon was the one to tell von Hodenberg that both their names were on the list. “We kind of felt a chill in our bones,” von Hodenberg told me when I caught up with the pair in early January.

But she added that they also quickly realized, “Okay, it’s the old playbook to silence us.” So they got to work—starting with challenging the narrative the US government was pushing about them.

Within a few hours, Ballon and von Hodenberg had issued a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations: “We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they wrote. “We demand a clear signal from the German government and the European Commission that this is unacceptable. Otherwise, no civil society organisation, no politician, no researcher, and certainly no individual will dare to denounce abuses by US tech companies in the future.”

Those signals came swiftly. On X, Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, called the entry bans “not acceptable,” adding that “the DSA was democratically adopted by the EU, for the EU—it does not have extraterritorial effect.” Also on X, French president Emmanuel Macron wrote that “these measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.” The European Commission issued a statement that it “strongly condemns” the Trump administration’s actions and reaffirmed its “sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values.”

Ahmed, Melford, Breton, and their respective organizations also made their own statements denouncing the entry bans. Ahmed, the only one of the five based in the United States, also successfully filed suit to preempt any attempts to detain him, which the State Department had indicated it would consider doing.

But alongside the statements of solidarity, Ballon and von Hodenberg said, they also received more practical advice: Assume the travel ban was just the start and that more consequences could be coming. Service providers might preemptively revoke access to their online accounts; banks might restrict their access to money or the global payment system; they might see malicious attempts to get hold of their personal data or that of their clients. Perhaps, allies told them, they should even consider moving their money into friends’ accounts or keeping cash on hand so that they could pay their team’s salaries—and buy their families’ groceries.

These warnings felt particularly urgent given that just days before, the Trump administration had sanctioned two International Criminal Court judges for “illegitimate targeting of Israel.” As a result, they had lost access to many American tech platforms, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Gmail.

“If Microsoft does that to someone who is a lot more important than we are,” Ballon told me, “they will not even blink to shut down the email accounts from some random human rights organization in Germany.”

“We have now this dark cloud over us that any minute, something can happen,” von Hodenberg added. “We’re running against time to take the appropriate measures.”

Founded in 2018 to support people experiencing digital violence, HateAid has since evolved to defend digital rights more broadly. It provides ways for people to report illegal online content and offers victims advice, digital security, emotional support, and help with evidence preservation. It also educates German police, prosecutors, and politicians about how to handle online hate crimes.

Once the group is contacted for help, and if its lawyers determine that the type of harassment has likely violated the law, the organization connects victims with legal counsel who can help them file civil and criminal lawsuits against perpetrators, and if necessary, helps finance the cases. (HateAid itself does not file cases against individuals.) Ballon and von Hodenberg estimate that HateAid has worked with around 7,500 victims and helped them file 700 criminal cases and 300 civil cases, mostly against individual offenders.

For 23-year-old German law student and outspoken political activist Theresia Crone, HateAid’s support has meant that she has been able to regain some sense of agency in her life, both on and offline. She had reached out after she discovered entire online forums dedicated to making deepfakes of her. Without HateAid, she told me, “I would have had to either put my faith into the police and the public prosecutor to prosecute this properly, or I would have had to foot the bill of an attorney myself”—a huge financial burden for “a student with basically no fixed income.”

In addition, working alone would have been retraumatizing: “I would have had to document everything by myself,” she said—meaning “I would have had to see all of these pictures again and again.”

“The internet is a lawless place,” Ballon told me when we first spoke, back in mid-December, a few weeks before the travel ban was announced. In a conference room at the HateAid office in Berlin, she said there are many cases that “cannot even be prosecuted, because no perpetrator is identified.” That’s why the nonprofit also advocates for better laws and regulations governing technology companies in Germany and across the European Union.

On occasion, they have also engaged in strategic litigation against the platforms themselves. In 2023, for example, HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students sued X for failing to enforce its terms of service against posts that were antisemitic or that denied the Holocaust, which is illegal in Germany.

This almost certainly put the organization in the crosshairs of X owner Elon Musk; it also made HateAid a frequent target of Germany’s far right party, the Alternative für Deutschland, which Musk has called “the only hope for Germany.” (X did not respond to a request to comment on this lawsuit.)

For better and worse, HateAid’s profile grew further when it took on another critical job in online safety. In June 2024, it was named as a trusted flagger organization under the Digital Services Act, a 2022 EU law that requires social media companies to remove certain content (including hate speech and violence) that violates national laws, and to provide more transparency to the public, in part by allowing more appeals on platforms’ moderation decisions.

Trusted flaggers are entities designated by individual EU countries to point out illegal content, and they are a key part of DSA enforcement. While anyone can report such content, trusted flaggers’ reports are prioritized and legally require a response from the platforms.

The Trump administration has loudly argued that the trusted flagger program and the DSA more broadly are examples of censorship that disproportionately affect voices on the right and American technology companies, like X.

When we first spoke in December, Ballon said these claims of censorship simply don’t hold water: “We don’t delete content, and we also don’t, like, flag content publicly for everyone to see and to shame people. The only thing that we do: We use the same notification channels that everyone can use, and the only thing that is in the Digital Services Act is that platforms should prioritize our reporting.” Then it is on the platforms to decide what to do.

Nevertheless, the idea that HateAid and like-minded organizations are censoring the right has become a powerful conspiracy theory with real-world consequences. (Last year, MIT Technology Review covered the closure of a small State Department office following allegations that it had conducted “censorship,” as well as an unusual attempt by State leadership to access internal records related to supposed censorship—including information about two of the people who have now been banned, Medford and Ahmed, and both of their organizations.)

HateAid saw a fresh wave of harassment starting last February, when 60 Minutes aired a documentary on hate speech laws in Germany; it featured a quote from Ballon that “free speech needs boundaries,” which, she added, “are part of our constitution.” The interview happened to air just days before Vice President JD Vance attended the Munich Security Conference; there he warned that “across Europe, free speech … is in retreat.” This, Ballon told me, led to heightened hostility toward her and her organization.

Fast-forward to July, when a report by Republicans in the US House of Representatives claimed that the DSA “compels censorship and infringes on American free speech.” HateAid was explicitly named in the report.

All of this has made its work “more dangerous,” Ballon told me in December. Before the 60 Minutes interview, “maybe one and a half years ago, as an organization, there were attacks against us, but mostly against our clients, because they were the activists, the journalists, the politicians at the forefront. But now … we see them becoming more personal.”

As a result, over the last year, HateAid has taken more steps to protect its reputation and get ahead of the damaging narratives. Ballon has reported the hate speech targeted at her—“More [complaints] than in all the years I did this job before,” she said—as well as defamation lawsuits on behalf of HateAid.

All these tensions finally came to a head in December. At the start of the month, the European Commission fined X $140 million for DSA violations. This set off yet another round of recriminations about supposed censorship of the right, with Trump calling the fine “a nasty one” and warning: “Europe has to be very careful.”

Just a few weeks later, the day before Christmas Eve, retaliation against individuals finally arrived.

Digital rights groups are pushing back against the Trump administration’s narrow view of what constitutes free speech and censorship.

“What we see from this administration is a conception of freedom of expression that is not a human-rights-based conception where this is an inalienable, indelible right that’s held by every person,” says David Greene, the civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based digital rights group. Rather, he sees an “expectation that… [if] anybody else&#39;s speech is challenged, there&#39;s a good reason for it, but it should never happen to them.”

Since Trump won his second term, social media platforms have walked back their commitments to trust and safety. Meta, for example, ended fact-checking on Facebook and adopted much of the administration’s censorship language, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling the podcaster Joe Rogan that it would “work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” if they are seen as “going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”

And as the recent fines on X show, Musk’s platform has gone even further in flouting European law—and, ultimately, ignoring the user rights that the DSA was written to protect. In perhaps one of the most egregious examples yet, in recent weeks X allowed people to use Grok, its AI generator, to create nonconsensual nude images of women and children, with few limits—and, so far at least, few consequences. (Last week, X released a statement that it would start limiting users&#39; ability to create explicit images with Grok; in response to a number of questions, X representative Rosemarie Esposito pointed me to that statement.)

For Ballon, it makes perfect sense: “You can better make money if you don’t have to implement safety measures and don’t have to invest money in making your platform the safest place,” she told me.

“It goes both ways,” von Hodenberg added. “It’s not only the platforms who profit from the US administration undermining European laws … but also, obviously, the US administration also has a huge interest in not regulating the platforms … because who is amplified right now? It’s the extreme right.”

She believes this explains why HateAid—and Ahmed’s Center for Countering Digital Hate and Melford’s Global Disinformation Index, as well as Breton and the DSA—have been targeted: They are working to disrupt this “unholy deal where the platforms profit economically and the US administration is profiting in dividing the European Union,” she said.

The travel restrictions intentionally send a strong message to all groups that work to hold tech companies accountable. “It’s purely vindictive,” Greene says. “It’s designed to punish people from pursuing further work on disinformation or anti-hate work.” (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.)

And ultimately, this has a broad effect on who feels safe enough to participate online.

Ballon pointed to research that shows the “silencing effect” of harassment and hate speech, not only for “those who have been attacked,” but also for those who witness such attacks. This is particularly true for women, who tend to face more online hate that is also more sexualized and violent. It’ll only be worse if groups like HateAid get deplatformed or lose funding.

Von Hodenberg put it more bluntly: “They reclaim freedom of speech for themselves when they want to say whatever they want, but they silence and censor the ones that criticize them.”

Still, the HateAid directors insist they’re not backing down. They say they’re taking “all advice” they have received seriously, especially with regard to “becoming more independent from service providers,” Ballon told me.

“Part of the reason that they don’t like us is because we are strengthening our clients and empowering them,” said von Hodenberg. “We are making sure that they are not succeeding, and not withdrawing from the public debate.”

“So when they think they can silence us by attacking us? That is just a very wrong perception.”

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated.”

—Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tells attendees at a healthcare conference this week his feelings about the anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been implementing, Bloomberg reports.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <h2>Three technologies that will shape biotech in 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/16/1131363/three-technologies-shape-biotech-in-2026-gene-editing-embryo-scoring/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

            <h2>Sequoia’s big bet on Anthropic</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.

            <h2>Europe’s €307 million AI funding call</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/europes-e307-million-ai-funding-call">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the European Commission announced on 15th of January a €307.3 million funding call for AI and related tech under Horizon Europe earlier this year, the press materials presented it as a strategic push toward trustworthy AI and European digital autonomy. The funding targets trustworthy AI, data services, robotics, quantum, photonics, and what Brussels calls “open strategic autonomy.”

Viewed in isolation, the number itself isn’t eye-popping. By global standards, where the private sector alone pours hundreds of billions into AI, €307 million is barely a rounding error. Yet this sum matters less for its scale and more for what it reveals about Europe’s longstanding dilemma: how to balance ambitious tech leadership with a cautious, value-driven regulatory culture.

What the EU has done here is consistent with a long-running pattern. Brussels has been building an AI ecosystem that explicitly prioritises ethics, safety , and strategic autonomy over raw capability. The “Apply AI Strategy,” which this funding supports, is designed to ensure AI systems are trustworthy and aligned with European values.

This contrasts sharply with the Silicon Valley model, where scale, speed , and commercial dominance often trump wider social aims.
There’s value in that distinction. Too much focus on growth alone can produce outcomes that benefit a few platforms while leaving society to manage the fallout from algorithmic bias , misinformation , and opaque decision-making systems.

Europe’s regulatory framework, including the Artificial Intelligence Act, embeds risk-based guardrails that aim to prevent harm without halting innovation entirely.

But here’s the rub: principle without productivity can feel like good intentions in a vacuum.

Three years into the AI revolution, the EU’s cumulative investments from this €307 million pool to broader programs under Horizon Europe reflect ambition on paper. But across hard metrics like proprietary model development, commercial AI exports, and infrastructure scale, Europe still lags the US and China. In 2025, reports noted Europe produced far fewer notable AI models than its global competitors, a symptom of a deeper ecosystem gap.

Investing in trustworthy AI is laudable; it’s also inherently longer-term, often without the immediate returns that lure commercial capital. By contrast, the US innovation model embraces iterative risk and market experimentation, which helps explain its dominance in foundational model research and deployment.

Here, Europe’s regulatory heft of the AI Act and related oversight mechanisms both help and hinder. Responsible frameworks can build trust and alignment with public values, but if they become too cumbersome, they risk slowing the very innovation they are meant to guide. Bosch’s leadership in Europe has cautioned against “regulating itself to death,” arguing that excessive bureaucracy deters research and deployment.

The €307 million funding explicitly aims to strengthen strategic autonomy and the ability of European innovators to develop AI technologies without dependency on external tech giants.

That’s a worthy goal. Yet autonomy is easier to declare than to realise. Achieving it requires not just funding research but building scale, infrastructure, talent, and market pull simultaneously. Europe’s efforts on AI gigafactories and high-performance computing centres signal long-term intent, but critics still see fragmentation in infrastructure and business support.
In other words, strategic autonomy without substantial ecosystem maturity can feel like sovereignty in theory, not practice.

The question isn’t whether Europe should fund AI research. The question is whether Europe can translate normative leadership into technological leadership.

If the goal is to lead in ethical, human-centric AI that serves public interest first, then this funding fits a broader philosophy. If the goal is to rival the scale and velocity of global tech powers, then incremental investments like this, however well-intentioned, are positions in a longer, incomplete race.

The EU’s approach to AI will succeed only if it pairs principled regulation with bold bets on infrastructure, startups and commercial pathways that scale quickly. That won’t happen through selective research grants alone.

Europe can still carve a distinctive niche in global AI. Its regulatory clarity, public-interest focus and collaborative innovation structures give it moral authority and, over time, competitive strength if it can channel them into meaningful technological outcomes.

For now, the €307 million is a marker on a long road, not a finish line. It signals where Brussels stands: committed to values, cautious by design, and eager to shape the trajectory of AI, even if it’s not yet setting the pace.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s decision to introduce advertisements inside ChatGPT for free users and its new $8 “Go” tier is already shaping up to be one of the most consequential pivots in generative AI’s short history. It’s not a simple business tweak. It’s a reframing of where digital intent, attention, and commercial influence intersect in an age where conversations increasingly replace search bars.

Yet, this moment will be remembered not as the day ads arrived in ChatGPT, but as the day two decades of assumptions about search and digital advertising broke open.

Read that again: ads won’t sit beside or above a list of links, as they do on Google. They will appear inside the conversational flow, at the moment a user has just received a helpful answer.

This is not incremental. It’s a new interface for intent.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

For years, OpenAI developed ChatGPT as an ad-free oasis in a web saturated with promotions, pop-ups, and sponsored results. Now it’s embracing the oldest monetization strategy on the internet: advertising.  The company insists ads will be clearly labeled, won’t influence AI responses, and won’t depend on selling individual user data. Ads will appear below answers when relevant, and paid tiers like Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise remain ad-free.

To understand why this matters, you need to see it not as an ad insertion, but as a shift in how commerce enters human intent, at the moment of decision, not distraction.

In a classic Google search, thoughtful queries turn into ranked links and ad slots beside them. In a ChatGPT conversation, a user asks a question, gets an answer, and stays in context; the frame never changes. An ad beneath that response isn’t an interruption; it’s an extension of the thought process. This subtle repositioning changes how brands can engage a user: they’re not chasing clicks after a search, they’re walking up with the answer itself.

That’s a paradigm shift. Brands are no longer competing for top billing on a results page; they are competing to be part of the narrative that unfolds between a question and a resolution. It’s a level of semantic proximity to intent that search ads never capture, because even the best keywords are guesses at nuance. ChatGPT sees nuance first.

Let restaurants, retailers, and SaaS companies imagine that: not just showing an ad after someone searches “best CRM tools,” but appearing contextually right when someone asks “what CRM features matter to small teams.” That changes where conversion flows start.

This isn’t happening. OpenAI’s infrastructure costs are enormous, and its free user base dwarfs its subscriber base. Only a small fraction of ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly active users currently pay. Advertising offers a scalable revenue path that could subsidize free access and help the company balance long-term costs.

It’s striking that OpenAI once positioned ads as a “last resort.” Now they’re a strategic mainstay. That tells you two things: the scale of AI compute bills is real, and the company is trying to find a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on subscription fatigue.

ChatGPT’s value isn’t just utility; it’s credibility, the feeling that the answer isn’t trying to sell you something. Introducing ads atop or below answers may be technically neutral, but perception is sticky. Once a user notices “Sponsored” within the thoughtful flow of a conversation, trust becomes negotiable. Academic research on ads in AI interfaces shows that even labeled ads can reduce perceived trust and make users feel manipulated, especially if they blur with responses.

OpenAI recognizes this. It’s promising to avoid showing ads in sensitive contexts, like health, politics, or personal advice, and won’t target minors. It’s also pledging that ads won’t twist the model’s answers.

Yet trust isn’t a function of code; it’s a feeling users develop over time. One poorly placed ad recommendation, even if accurate, can make people wonder whether the answer was shaped by commercial rather than objective logic.

From a creative standpoint, this is both exciting and fraught. The ads we’ve long tolerated have trained us to think of marketing as interruption: banners, pop-ups, pre-roll videos. ChatGPT’s approach suggests something closer to contextual dialogue, where an ad feels like a part of exploration. The brands that succeed here won’t be the loudest; they’ll be the most relevant, most resonant, and most human. They’ll read like answers, not impositions, because they’re embedded in answers.

That opens a new creative demand: marketers will need to think less about clickbait hooks and more about narrative relevance, how to be helpful within a user’s question, not beside it.

Is this the end of Google? No. Google’s advertising machine is vast, integrated, and highly optimized. Its AI integration in search, including AI summaries, already blends insight with ads in ways that are more sophisticated than many realize.

But the rise of ads in ChatGPT signals that intent has multiple layers now. There’s traditional search intent tied to links and pages, and there’s conversational intent captured in natural language interactions. These layers will coexist, sometimes reinforce, sometimes compete.

Advertisers and creators today often optimize for keywords. Tomorrow, they’ll optimize for conversational moments, the semantic cues that signal purchase interest within a dialogue.

The rollout now is just the beginning. If AI systems evolve into multi-modal, interactive assistants that help people plan trips, make purchases, write essays, plan budgets, and solve problems of every sort, the point at which commerce enters that interaction becomes crucial.

The question is no longer “Will people see our ad?” but “Will they trust our recommendation when it pops up next to an AI answer?”

That’s the real test, and the real frontier.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bizzynow-opens-mamacrowd-equity-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <h2>What AI is actually doing to jobs in Europe</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.
