            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.26 of the Rocket Report! The past week has been one of advancements and setbacks in the rocket business. NASA rolled the massive rocket for the Artemis II mission to its launch pad in Florida, while Chinese launchers suffered back-to-back failures within a span of approximately 12 hours. Rocket Lab’s march toward a debut of its new Neutron launch vehicle in the coming months may have stalled after a failure during a key qualification test. We cover all this and more in this week’s Rocket Report.

Australia invests in sovereign launch. Six months after its first orbital rocket cleared the launch tower for just 14 seconds before crashing back to Earth, Gilmour Space Technologies has secured 217 million Australian dollars ($148 million) in funding that CEO Adam Gilmour says finally gives Australia a fighting chance in the global space race, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The funding round, led by the federal government’s National Reconstruction Fund Corporation and superannuation giant Hostplus with $75 million each, makes the Queensland company Australia’s newest unicorn—a fast-growth start-up valued at more than $1 billion—and one of the country’s most heavily backed private technology ventures.

Homegrown rocket… “We’re a rocket company that has never had access to the capital that our American competitors have,” Gilmour told the newspaper. “This is the first raise where I’ve actually raised a decent amount of capital compared to the rest of the world.” The investment reflects growing concern about Australia’s reliance on foreign launch providers—predominantly Elon Musk’s SpaceX—to put government, defense, and commercial satellites into orbit. With US launch queues stretching beyond two years and geopolitical tensions reshaping access to space infrastructure, Canberra has identified sovereign launch capability as a strategic priority. Gilmour’s first Eris rocket lifted off from the Bowen Orbital Spaceport in North Queensland on July 30 last year. It achieved 14 seconds of flight before falling back to the ground, a result Gilmour framed as a partial success in an industry where first launches routinely fail.

Isar Aerospace postpones test flight. Isar Aerospace scrubbed a potential January 21 launch of its Spectrum rocket to address a technical fault, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. Hours before the launch window was set to open, the German company said that it was addressing “an issue with a pressurization valve.” A valve issue was one of the factors that caused a Spectrum to crash moments after liftoff on Isar’s first test flight last year. “The teams are currently assessing the next possible launch opportunities and a new target date will be announced shortly,” the company wrote in a post on its website. The Spectrum rocket, designed to haul cargoes of up to a metric ton (2,200 pounds) to low-Earth orbit, is awaiting liftoff from Andøya Spaceport in Norway.

Geopolitics at play... The second launch of Isar’s Spectrum rocket comes at a time when Europe’s space industry looks to secure the continent’s sovereignty in spaceflight. European satellites are no longer able to launch on Russian rockets, and the continent’s leaders don’t have much of an appetite to turn to US rockets amid strained trans-Atlantic relations. Europe’s satellite industry is looking for more competition for the Ariane 6 and Vega C rockets developed by ArianeGroup and Avio, and Isar Aerospace appears to be best positioned to become a new entrant in the European launch market. “I’m well aware that it would be really good for us Europeans to get this one right,” said Daniel Metzler, Isar’s co-founder and CEO.

A potential buyer for Orbex? UK-based rocket builder Orbex has signed a letter of intent to sell its business to European space logistics startup The Exploration Company, European Spaceflight reports. Orbex was founded in 2015 and is developing a small launch vehicle called Prime. The company also began work on a larger medium-lift launch vehicle called Proxima in December 2024. On Wednesday, Orbex published a brief press release stating that a letter of intent had been signed and that negotiations had begun. The company added that all details about the transaction remain confidential at this stage.

Time’s up... A statement from Orbex CEO Phil Chambers suggests that the company’s financial position factored into its decision to pursue a buyer. “Our Series D fundraising could have led us in many directions,” said Chambers. “We believe this opportunity plays to the strengths of both businesses, and we look forward to sharing more when the time is right.” The Exploration Company, headquartered near Munich, Germany, is developing a reusable space capsule to ferry cargo to low-Earth orbit and a high-thrust reusable rocket engine. It is one of the most well-financed space startups in Europe. Orbex is one of five launch startups in Europe selected by the European Space Agency last year to compete in the European Launcher Challenge and receive funding from ESA member states. But the UK company’s financial standing is in question. Orbex’s Danish subsidiary is filing for bankruptcy, and its main UK entity is overdue in filing its 2024 financial accounts. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

A bad day for Chinese rockets. China suffered a pair of launch failures January 16, seeing the loss of a classified Shijian satellite and the failed first launch of the Ceres-2 rocket, Space News reports. The first of the two failures involved the attempted launch of a Shijian military satellite aboard a Long March 3B rocket from the Xichang launch base in southwestern China. The Shijian 32 satellite was likely heading for a geostationary transfer orbit, but a failure of the Long March 3B’s third stage doomed the mission. The Long March 3B is one of China’s most-flown rockets, and this was the first failure of a Long March 3-series vehicle since 2020, ending a streak of 50 consecutive successful flights of the rocket.

And then… Less than 12 hours later, another Chinese rocket failed on its climb to orbit. This launch, using a Ceres-2 rocket, originated from the Jiuquan space center in northwestern China. It was the first flight of the Ceres-2, a larger variant of the light-class Ceres-1 rocket developed and operated by a Chinese commercial startup named Galactic Energy. Chinese officials did not disclose the payloads lost on the Ceres-2 rocket.

Neutron in neutral. Rocket Lab suffered a structural failure of the Neutron rocket’s Stage 1 tank during testing, setting back efforts to get to the inaugural flight for the partially reusable launcher, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. The mishap occurred during a hydrostatic pressure trial, the company said Wednesday. “There was no significant damage to the test structure or facilities,” Rocket Lab added. Rocket Lab last year pushed the first Neutron mission from 2025 to 2026, citing the volume of testing ahead. The US-based company said it is now analyzing what transpired to determine the impact on Neutron launch plans. Rocket Lab said it would provide an update during its next quarterly financials, due in a few weeks.

Where to go from here?… The Neutron rocket is designed to catapult Rocket Lab into more direct competition with legacy rocket companies like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance. “The next Stage 1 tank is already in production, and Neutron’s development campaign continues,” the company said. Setbacks like this one are to be expected during the development of new rockets. Rocket Lab has publicized aggressive, or aspirational, launch schedules for the first Neutron rocket, so it’s likely the company will hang onto its projection of a debut launch in 2026, at least for now.

Falcon 9 launches NRO spysats. SpaceX executed a late night Falcon 9 launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base on January 16, carrying an undisclosed number of intelligence-gathering satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office, Spaceflight Now reports. The mission, NROL-105, hauled a payload of satellites heading to low-Earth orbit, which are believed to be Starshield, a government variant of the Starlink satellites. “Today’s mission is the twelfth overall launch of the NRO’s proliferated architecture and first of approximately a dozen NRO launches scheduled throughout 2026 consisting of proliferated and national security missions,” the NRO said in a post-launch statement.

Mysteries abound… A public accounting of the agency’s proliferated constellation suggests it now numbers nearly 200 satellites with the ability to rapidly image locations around the world. The NRO has dozens more satellites serving other functions. “Having hundreds of NRO satellites on orbit is critical to supporting our nation and its partners,” the agency said in a statement. “This growing constellation enhances mission resilience and capability through reduced revisit times, improved persistent coverage, and accelerated processing and delivery of critical data.” What was unusual about the January 16 mission is it may have only carried two satellites, well short of the 20-plus Starshield satellites launched on most previous Falcon 9 launches, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and expert tracker of global space launch activity.

Long March 12B hot-fired at Jiuquan. China’s main space contractor performed a static fire test of a new reusable Long March rocket Friday, paving the way for a test flight, Space News reports. The test-firing of the Long March 12B rocket’s first stage engines occurred on a launch pad at the Dongfeng Commercial Space Innovation Test Zone at Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China. The mere existence of the Long March 12B rocket was not publicly known until recently. The new rocket was developed by a subsidiary of the state-owned China Aerospace Science Technology Corporation, with the capacity to carry a payload of 20 metric tons to low-Earth orbit in expendable mode. It’s unknown if the first Long March 12B test flight will include a booster landing attempt.

Another one… The Long March 12B has a reusable first stage with landing legs, similar to the recovery architecture of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. The booster is designed to land downrange at a recovery zone in the Gobi Desert. The Long March 12B is the latest in a line of partially reusable Chinese rockets to reach the launch pad, following soon after the debut launches of the Long March 12A and Zhuque 3 rocket last month. Several more companies in China are working on their own reusable boosters. Of them all, the Long March 12B appears to be the closest to a clone of SpaceX’s Falcon 9. Like the Falcon 9, the Long March 12B will have nine kerosene-fueled first stage engines and a single kerosene-fueled upper stage engine. Chinese officials have not announced when the Long March 12B will launch.

Artemis II rolls to the launch pad. Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward last weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad, Ars reports. The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth.

Key test ahead… “This is the start of a very long journey,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “We ended our last human exploration of the Moon on Apollo 17.” The Artemis II mission will set several notable human spaceflight records. Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen will travel farther from Earth than any human in history as they travel beyond the far side of the Moon. They won’t land. That distinction will fall to the next mission in line in NASA’s Artemis program. This will be the first time astronauts have flown on the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The launch window opens February 6, but the exact date of Artemis II’s liftoff will be determined by the outcome of a critical fueling test of the SLS rocket scheduled for early February.

Blue Origin confirms rocket reuse plan. Blue Origin confirmed Thursday that the next launch of its New Glenn rocket will carry a large communications satellite into low-Earth orbit for AST SpaceMobile, Ars reports. The rocket will launch the next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellite “no earlier than late February” from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. However, the update from Blue Origin appears to have buried the real news toward the end: “The mission follows the successful NG-2 mission, which included the landing of the ‘Never Tell Me The Odds’ booster. The same booster is being refurbished to power NG-3,” the company said.

Impressive strides… The second New Glenn mission launched on November 13, just 10 weeks ago. If the company makes the late-February target for the next mission—and Ars was told last week to expect the launch to slip into March—it will represent a remarkably short turnaround for an orbital booster. By way of comparison, SpaceX did not attempt to refly the first Falcon 9 booster it landed in December 2015. Instead, initial tests revealed that the vehicle’s interior had been somewhat torn up. It was scrapped and inspected closely so that engineers could learn from the wear and tear.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every spring, raptors return to nesting sites across northern Michigan. The smallest of these birds of prey, a falcon called the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), flies through the region’s many cherry orchards and spends its days hunting for even tinier creatures to eat. This quest keeps the kestrels fed, but it also benefits the region’s cherry farmers.

Fruit farmers have been working symbiotically with kestrels for decades, adding nesting boxes and reaping the benefits of the birds eliminating the mice, voles, songbirds, and other pests that wreak havoc by feeding on not-yet-harvested crops. In addition to limiting the crop damage caused by hungry critters, new research suggests kestrels also lower the risk of food-borne illnesses.

The study, published in November in the Journal of Applied Ecology, suggests the kestrels help keep harmful pathogens off of fruit headed to consumers by eating and scaring off small birds that carry those pathogens. Orchards housing the birds in nest boxes saw fewer cherry-eating birds than orchards without kestrels on site. This translated to an 81 percent reduction in crop damage—such as bite marks or missing fruit—and a 66 percent decrease in branches contaminated with bird feces.

“Kestrels are not very expensive to bring into orchards, but they work pretty well” at deterring unwanted bird species, said Olivia Smith, lead study author and assistant professor of horticulture at Michigan State University. “And people just like kestrels a lot, so I think it’s an attractive strategy.”

Finding a good strategy for managing pests is essential for cherry farmers. Pests cause expensive damage that worsens yields already impacted by other threats to the cherry industry, such as climate change, labor shortages, and the vagaries of international trade. To stop the added damage from pests, growers have turned to nets covering their trees, noisemakers, scarecrows, pesticides, and even the removal of natural habitats around crop-growing areas.

However, these options can be expensive and aren’t always effective. Even with these management strategies in place, birds like starlings, robins, and crows cost farms in some top cherry growing states—including Michigan, New York, Oregon, Washington, and California—about $85 million annually. For many growers, this is where the kestrels come in.

It may seem counterintuitive to solve a bird problem by bringing in more birds, but kestrels are skilled hunters whose presence drives off songbirds afraid of being eaten. Habitat loss, competition for food, and climate change are leading to slow and steady population declines for the American kestrel, losses of about 1.4 percent annually. Still, these birds are abundant enough that, in many areas of the continental United States, all farmers need to do to attract them is add a nesting box to their land.

“I’ve noticed a difference having the kestrels around, hovering over the spring crops,” said Brad Thatcher, a farmer based in Washington state who has housed kestrels on April Joy Farm, an organic fruit and vegetable farm, for over 13 years. “There’s very little fecal damage from small songbirds at that time of year versus the fall.”

With farmers who already had kestrels on their land reporting fewer songbirds and less crop damage, study authors hypothesized that food safety risks associated with pathogens birds carry may also be lower for farms harboring kestrels. To test this, the researchers evaluated 16 sweet cherry orchards in Michigan’s Leelanau and Grand Traverse counties (the latter of which is considered the “Cherry Capital of the World”). Eight of the orchards studied had nesting boxes for kestrels and eight did not.

The study authors randomly selected two areas of each orchard to search for crop damage and fecal contamination. The orchards frequented by kestrels saw the amount of damaged fruit drop from 2.5 percent to 0.47 percent. The number of crops contaminated by bird droppings also saw a three-fold decrease, falling from 6.88 percent to 2.33 percent. When researchers tested this excrement, they found that more than 10 percent contained campylobacter, a type of bacteria that is common in birds and causes food-borne illness in humans.

Campylobacter is a common cause of food poisoning and is on the rise in Michigan and around the world. It spreads to humans through food products made from, or that come into contact with, infected animals, primarily chickens and other birds. So far, only one outbreak of campylobacteriosis has been definitively linked to feces from wild birds. Still, because it causes milder symptoms than some other types of bacteria, the Centers for Disease Control considers campylobacter a significantly underreported cause of food-borne illness that may be more common than current data indicates.

“Trying to get more birds of prey would be beneficial to farmers,” Smith said. “If you have one predator, versus a bunch of prey, you have fewer birds overall. If you have a lot fewer birds, even if the ones that are there are carrying bacteria, then you can reduce the transmission risk.”

The study’s findings that kestrels significantly reduce physical damage and food safety risks on Michigan cherry farms demonstrate that managing crops and meeting conservation goals—by bolstering local kestrel populations and eliminating the need to clear wildlife habitat around agricultural areas—can be done in tandem, study authors say. They recommend farmers facing pest-management issues consider building kestrel boxes, which cost about $100 per box and require minimal maintenance.

Whether nesting boxes in a given region will be successfully inhabited by kestrels depends on whether there is an abundance of the birds there. In Michigan’s cherry-growing region, kestrels are so abundant that 80 percent to 100 percent of boxes become home for kestrels rather than other nesting birds, said Catherine Lindell, avian ecologist at Michigan State University and senior author of the study.

“It seems like this is just a great tool for farmers,” Lindell said, suggesting interested farmers “put up a couple boxes and see what happens.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Life as a startup carmaker is hard—just ask Lucid Motors.

When we met the brand and its prototype Lucid Air sedan in 2017, the company planned to put the first cars in customers’ hands within a couple of years. But you know what they say about plans. A lack of funding paused everything until late 2018, when Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund bought itself a stake. A billion dollars meant Lucid could build a factory—at the cost of alienating some former fans because of the source.

Then the pandemic happened, further pushing back timelines as supply shortages took hold. But the Air did go on sale, and it has more recently been joined by the Gravity SUV. There’s even a much more affordable midsize SUV in the works called the Earth. Sales more than doubled in 2025, and after spending a week with a model year 2026 Lucid Air Touring, I can understand why.

There are now quite a few different versions of the Air to choose from. For just under a quarter of a million dollars, there’s the outrageously powerful Air Sapphire, which offers acceleration so rapid it’s unlikely your internal organs will ever truly get used to the experience. At the other end of the spectrum is the $70,900 Air Pure, a single-motor model that’s currently the brand’s entry point but which also stands as a darn good EV.

The last time I tested a Lucid, it was the Air Grand Touring almost three years ago. That car mostly impressed me but still felt a little unfinished, especially at $138,000. This time, I looked at the Air Touring, which starts at $79,900, and the experience was altogether more polished.

The Touring features a less-powerful all-wheel-drive powertrain than the Grand Touring, although to put “less-powerful” into context, with 620 hp (462 kW) on tap, there are almost as many horses available as in the legendary McLaren F1. (That remains a mental benchmark for many of us of a certain age.)

The Touring’s 885 lb-ft (1,160 Nm) is far more than BMW’s 6-liter V12 can generate, but at 5,009 lbs (2,272 kg), the electric sedan weighs twice as much as the carbon-fiber supercar. The fact that the Air Touring can reach 60 mph (98 km/h) from a standing start in just 0.2 seconds more than the McLaren tells you plenty about how much more accessible acceleration has become in the past few decades.

At least, it will if you choose the fastest of the three drive modes, labeled Sprint. There’s also Swift, and the least frantic of the three, Smooth. Helpfully, each mode remembers your regenerative braking setting when you lift the accelerator pedal. Unlike many other EVs, Lucid does not use a brake-by-wire setup, and pressing the brake pedal will only ever slow the car via friction brakes. Even with lift-off regen set to off, the car does not coast well due to its permanent magnet electric motors, unlike the electric powertrains developed by German OEMs like Mercedes-Benz.

This is not to suggest that Lucid is doing something wrong—not with its efficiency numbers. On 19-inch aero-efficient wheels, the car has an EPA range of 396 miles (673 km) from a 92 kWh battery pack. As just about everyone knows, you won’t get ideal EV efficiency during winter, and our test with the Lucid in early January coincided with some decidedly colder temperatures, as well as larger ($1,750) 20-inch wheels. Despite this, I averaged almost 4 miles/kWh (15.5 kWh/100 km) on longer highway drives, although this fell to around 3.5 miles/kWh (17.8 kWh/100 km) in the city.

Recharging the Air Touring also helped illustrate how the public DC fast-charging experience has matured over the years. The Lucid uses the ISO 15118 “plug and charge” protocol, so you don’t need to mess around with an app or really do anything more complicated than plug the charging cable into the Lucid’s CCS1 socket.

After the car and charger complete their handshake, the car gives the charger account and billing info, then the electrons flow. Charging from 27 to 80 percent with a manually preconditioned battery took 36 minutes. During that time, the car added 53.3 kWh, which equated to 209 miles (336 km) of range, according to the dash. Although we didn’t test AC charging, 0–100 percent should take around 10 hours.

I’ll admit, I’m a bit of a sucker for the way the Air looks when it’s not two-tone. That’s the Stealth option ($1,750), and the dark Fathom Blue Metallic paint ($800) and blacked-out aero wheels pushed many of my buttons. I found plenty to like from the driver’s seat, too. The 34-inch display that wraps around the driver once looked massive—now it feels relatively restrained compared to the “Best Buy on wheels” effect in some other recent EVs. The fact that the display isn’t very tall helps its feeling of restraint here.

In the middle is a minimalist display for the driver, with touch-sensitive displays on either side. To your left are controls for the lights, locks, wipers, and so on. These icons are always in the same place, though there’s no tactile feedback. The infotainment screen to the right is within the driver’s reach, and it’s here that (wireless) Apple CarPlay will show up. As you can see in a photo below, CarPlay fills the irregularly shaped screen with a wallpaper but keeps its usable area confined to the rectangle in the middle.

The curved display floats above the textile-covered dash, and the daylight visible between them helps the cabin’s sense of spaciousness, even without a panoramic glass roof. A stowable touchscreen display lower down on the center console is where you control vehicle, climate, seat, and lighting settings, although there are also physical controls for temperature and volume on the dash. The relatively good overall ergonomics take a bit of a hit from the steeply raked A pillar, which creates a blind spot for the driver.

For all the Air Touring’s power, it isn’t a car that goads you into using it all. In fact, I spent most of the week in the gentlest setting, Smooth. It’s an easy car to drive slowly, and the rather artificial feel of the steering at low speeds means you probably won’t take it hunting apices on back roads. I should note, though, that each drive mode has its own steering calibration.

On the other hand, as a daily driver and particularly on longer drives, the Touring did a fine job. Despite being relatively low to the ground, it’s easy to get into and out of. The rear seat is capacious, and the ride is smooth, so passengers will enjoy it. Even more so if they sit up front—Lucid has some of the best (optional, $3,750) massaging seats in the business, which vibrate as well as kneading you. There’s a very accessible 22 cubic foot (623 L) trunk as well as a 10 cubic foot (283 L) frunk, so it’s practical, too.

Our test Air was fitted with Lucid’s DreamDrive Pro advanced driver assistance system ($6,750), which includes a hands-free “level 2+” assist that requires you to pay attention to the road ahead but which handles accelerating, braking, and steering. Using the turn signal tells the car to perform a lane change if it’s safe, and I found it to be an effective driver assist with an active driver monitoring system (which uses a gaze-tracking camera to ensure the driver is doing their part).

Lucid rolled out the more advanced features of DreamDrive Pro last summer, and it plans to develop the system into a more capable “level 3” partially automated system that lets the driver disengage completely from the act of driving, at least at lower speeds. Although that system is some ways off—and level 3 systems are only road-legal in Nevada and California right now anyway—even the current level 2+ system leverages lidar as well as cameras, radar, and ultrasonics, and the dash display does a good job of showing you what other vehicles the Air is perceiving around it when the system is active.

As mentioned above, the model year 2026 Air feels polished, far more so than the last Lucid I drove. Designed by a refugee from Tesla, the car promised to improve on the EVs from that brand in every way. And while early Airs might have fallen short in execution, the cars can now credibly be called finished products, with much better fit and finish than a few years ago.

I’ll go so far as to say that I might have a hard time deciding between an Air or an equivalently priced Porsche Taycan were I in the market for a luxury electric four-door, even though they both offer quite different driving experiences. Be warned, though, like with the Porsche, the options can add up quickly, and the resale prices can be shockingly low.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The world’s oldest surviving rock art is a faded outline of a hand on an Indonesian cave wall, left 67,800 years ago.

On a tiny island just off the coast of Sulawesi (a much larger island in Indonesia), a cave wall bears the stenciled outline of a person’s hand—and it’s at least 67,800 years old, according to a recent study. The hand stencil is now the world’s oldest work of art (at least until archaeologists find something even older), as well as the oldest evidence of our species on any of the islands that stretch between continental Asia and Australia.

Archaeologist Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency, and his colleagues have spent the last six years surveying 44 rock art sites, mostly caves, on Sulawesi’s southeastern peninsula and the handful of tiny “satellite islands” off its coast. They found 14 previously undocumented sites and used rock formations to date 11 individual pieces of rock art in eight caves—including the oldest human artwork discovered so far.

About 67,800 years ago, someone stood in the darkness of Liang Metanduno and placed their hand flat against the limestone wall. They, or maybe a friend, then blew a mixture of pigment and water onto the wall, covering and surrounding their hand. When they pulled their hand carefully away from the rock, careful not to disturb the still-wet paint, they left behind a crisp outline of their palm and fingers, haloed by a cloud of deep red.

The result is basically the negative of a handprint, and it’s a visceral, tangible link to the past. Someone once laid their hand on the cave wall right here, and you can still see its outline like a lingering ghost, reaching out from the other side of the rock. If you weren’t worried about damaging the already faded and fragile image, you could lay your hand in the same spot and meet them halfway.

Today, the stencil is so faded that you can barely see it, but if you look closely, it’s there: a faint halo of reddish-orange pigment, outlining the top part of a palm and the base of the fingers. A thin, nearly transparent layer of calcite covers the faded shape, left behind by millennia of water dripping down the cave wall. The ratio of uranium and thorium in a sheet of calcite suggests that it formed at least 71,000 years ago—so the outline of the hand beneath it must have been left behind sometime before that, probably around 67,800 years ago.

That makes Liang Metanduno the home of the oldest known artwork in the world, beating the previous contender (a Neanderthal hand stencil in Spain) by about 1,100 years.

“These findings support the growing view that Sulawesi was host to a vibrant and longstanding artistic culture during the late Pleistocene epoch,” wrote Oktaviana and his colleagues in their recent paper.

The karst caves of Sulawesi’s southwestern peninsula, Maros-Pangkep, are a treasure trove of deeply ancient artwork: hand stencils, as well as drawings of wild animals, people, and strange figures that seem to blend the two. A cave wall at Liang Bulu’Sipong 4 features a 4.5-meter-long mural of humanlike figures facing off against wild pigs and dwarf buffalo, and a 2024 study pushed the mural’s age back to 51,200 years ago, making it the second-oldest artwork that we know of (after the Liang Metanduno hand stencil in the recent study).

Archaeologists have only begun to rediscover the rock art of Maros-Pangkep in the last decade or so, and other areas of the island, like Southeast Sulawesi and its tiny satellite islands, have received even less attention—so we don’t know what’s still there waiting for humanity to find again after dozens of millennia. We also don’t know what the ancient artist was trying to convey with the outline of their hand on the cave wall, but part of the message rings loud and clear across tens of millennia: At least 67,800 years ago, someone was here.

The hand stencil on the wall of Liang Metanduno is, so far, the oldest evidence of our presence in Wallacea, the group of islands stretched between the continental shelves of Asia and Australia. Populating these islands is “widely considered to have involved the first planned, long-distance sea crossing undertaken by our species,” wrote Oktaviana and his colleagues.

Back when the long-lost artist laid their hand on the wall, sea levels were about 100 meters lower than they are today. Mainland Asia, Sumatra, and Borneo would have been high points in a single landmass, joined by wide swaths of lowlands that today lie beneath shallow ocean. The eastern shore of Borneo would have been a jumping-off point, beyond which lay several dozen kilometers of water and (out of view over the horizon) Sulawesi.

The first few people may have washed ashore on Sulawesi on some misadventure: lost fishermen or tsunami survivors, maybe. But at some point, people must have started making the crossing on purpose, which implies that they knew how to build rafts or boats, how to steer them, and that land awaited them on the other side.

Liang Metanduno pushes back the timing of that crossing by nearly 10,000 years. It also lends strong support to arguments that people arrived in Australia earlier than archaeologists had previously suspected. Archaeological evidence from a rock shelter called Madjedbebe, in northern Australia, suggests that people were living there by 65,000 years ago. But that evidence is still debated (such is the nature of archaeology), and some archaeologists argue that humans didn’t reach the continent until around 50,000 years ago.

“With the discovery of rock art dating to at least 67,800 years ago in Sulawesi, a large island on the most plausible colonization route to Australia, it is increasingly likely that the controversial date of 65,000 years for the initial peopling of Australia is correct,” Griffith University archaeologists Adam Brumm, a coauthor of the recent study, told Ars.

Archaeologists are still trying to work out exactly when, where, and how the first members of our species made the leap from the continent of Asia to the islands of Wallacea and, eventually, via several more open-water crossings, to Australia. Our picture of the process is pieced together from archaeological finds and models of ancient geography and sea levels.

“There’s been all sorts of work done on this (not by me), but often researchers consider the degree of intervisibility between islands, as well as other things like prevailing ocean currents and wind directions, changes in sea levels and how this affects the land area of islands and shorelines and so on,” Brumm said.

Most of those models suggest that people crossed the Makassar Strait from Borneo to Sulawesi, then island-hopped through what’s now Indonesia until they reached the western edge of New Guinea. At the time, lower sea levels would have left New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand as one big land mass, so getting from New Guinea to what’s now Australia would actually have been the easy part.

There’s a sense of deep, deep time in Liang Metanduno. The cave wall is a palimpsest on which the ancient hand stencil is nearly covered by a brown-hued drawing of a chicken, which (based on its subject matter) must have been added sometime after 5,000 years ago, when a new wave of settlers brought domesticated chickens to the island. It seems almost newfangled against the ghostly faint outline of the Paleolithic hand.

A few centimeters away is another hand stencil, done in darker pigment and dating to around 21,500 years ago; it overlays a lighter stencil dating to around 60,900 years ago. Over tens of thousands of years, generations of people returned here with the same impulse. We have no way of knowing whether visitors 21,500 years ago, or 5,000 years ago might have seen a more vibrantly decorated cave wall than what’s preserved today—but we know that they decided to leave their mark on it.

And the people who visited the cave 21,500 years ago shared a sense of style with the artists who left their hands outlined on the wall nearly 40,000 years before them: both handprints have slightly pointed fingers, as if the artist either turned their fingertip or just touched-up the outline with some paint after making the stencil. It’s very similar to other hand stencils, dated to around 17,000 years ago, from elsewhere on Sulawesi, and it’s a style that seems unique to the island.

“We may conclude that this regionally unique variant of stencil art is much older than previously thought,” wrote Oktaviana and his colleagues.

And Homo sapiens wasn’t the first hominin species to venture as far as Indonesia; at least 200,000 years earlier, Homo erectus made a similar journey, leaving behind fossils and stone tools to mark that they, too, were once here. On some of the smaller islands, isolated populations of Homo erectus started to evolve along their own paths, eventually leading to diminutive species like Homo floresiensis (the O.G. hobbits) on Flores and Homo luzonensis on Luzon. Homo floresiensis co-discoverer Richard Roberts has suggested that other isolated hominin species may have existed on other scattered islands.

Anthropologists haven’t found any fossil evidence of these species after 50,000 years ago, but if our species was in Indonesia by nearly 68,000 years ago, we would have been in time to meet our hominin cousins.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As of today, the US is no longer a member of the World Health Organization—and it leaves the United Nations health agency with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills, according to reporting by Stat News.

A year ago today, the US informed the WHO of its intent to exit, setting the clock for a one-year withdrawal period mandated in a 1948 joint resolution of Congress. But, in practice, the withdrawal was immediate, with the Trump administration cutting all ties with WHO upon the announcement. In explaining his reasoning for leaving the WHO, Trump referenced his long-standing complaints about the agency’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, dues payments, and alleged protection of China. Trump had attempted to extract the US from WHO during his first term, but the Biden administration rescinded the withdrawal on the first day in office, well before the one-year notice period was reached.

The joint resolution also stipulated that the US would have to pay its financial obligations in full before departing. But, that too has not been honored by the Trump administration. According to Stat, the US owed the WHO $278 million in dues, which are a percentage of each member state’s gross domestic product. That dues payment covered the country’s 2024–2025 membership, as WHO runs on a two-year budget cycle.

In the past, such payments were made through the State Department’s international agencies bureau. A spokesperson for the department told Stat that there was no way the US would pay its debt.

“The United States will not be making any payments to the WHO before our withdrawal on January 22, 2026,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “The cost [borne] by the US taxpayer and US economy after the WHO’s failure during the COVID pandemic—and since—has been too high as it is. We will ensure that no more US funds are routed to this organization.”

In addition, the US had also promised to provide $490 million in voluntary contributions for those two years. The funding would have gone toward efforts such as the WHO’s health emergency program, tuberculosis control, and the polio eradication effort, Stat reports. Two anonymous sources told Stat that some of that money was paid, but they couldn’t provide an estimate of how much.

The loss of both past and future financial support from the US has been a hefty blow to the WHO. Immediately upon notification last January, the WHO began cutting costs. Those included freezing recruitment, restricting travel expenditures, making all meetings virtual, limiting IT equipment updates, and suspending office refurbishment. The agency also began cutting staff and leaving positions unfilled. According to Stat, the WHO staff is on track to be down 22 percent by the middle of this year.

In a recent press conference, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the US withdrawal is a “lose-lose situation” for the US and the rest of the world. The US will lose access to infectious disease intelligence and sway over outbreak responses, and global health security will be weakened overall. “I hope they will reconsider,” Tedros said.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/overrun-with-ai-slop-curl-scraps-bug-bounties-to-ensure-intact-mental-health/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The project developer for one of the Internet’s most popular networking tools is scrapping its vulnerability reward program after being overrun by a spike in the submission of low-quality reports, much of it AI-generated slop.

“We are just a small single open source project with a small number of active maintainers,” Daniel Stenberg, the founder and lead developer of the open source app cURL, said Thursday. “It is not in our power to change how all these people and their slop machines work. We need to make moves to ensure our survival and intact mental health.”

His comments came as cURL users complained that the move was treating the symptoms caused by AI slop without addressing the cause. The users said they were concerned the move would eliminate a key means for ensuring and maintaining the security of the tool. Stenberg largely agreed, but indicated his team had little choice.

In a separate post on Thursday, Stenberg wrote: “We will ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports.” An update to cURL’s official GitHub account made the termination, which takes effect at the end of this month, official.

cURL was first released three decades ago, under the name httpget and later urlget. It has since become an indispensable tool among admins, researchers, and security professionals, among others, for a wide range of tasks, including file transfers, troubleshooting buggy web software, and automating tasks. cURL is integrated into default versions of Windows, macOS, and most distributions of Linux.

As such a widely used tool for interacting with vast amounts of data online, security is paramount. Like many other software makers, cURL project members have relied on private bug reports submitted by outside researchers. To provide an incentive and to reward high-quality submissions, the project members have paid cash bounties in return for reports of high-severity vulnerabilities.

Last May, Stenberg said the number of low-quality AI-generated reports was putting a strain on the cURL security team and was likely to metastasize, hampering other software developers.

“AI slop is overwhelming maintainers *today* and it won’t stop at curl but only starts there,” he said at the time.

The lead developer has also posted a page listing some of the specious reports submitted in recent months. In response to one such report, a cURL project member wrote: “I think you’re a victim of LLM hallucination.” The member continued:

The text has some similarities to the (bogus) CVE-2020-19909 and other reports. There are plenty of clues that Bard has manufactured bogus information: that code snippet of “curl_easy_setopt” doesn’t match the actual signature of the function (and wouldn’t even compile), a changelog that don’t match reality, and more indications that this is completely bogus. I’m curious to hear what your exploit does against a made-up vulnerability. Care to share it?

After the bug reporter complained and reiterated the risk posed by the non-existent vulnerability, Stenberg jumped in and wrote: “You were fooled by an AI into believing that. In what way did we not meet our end of the deal?

Stenberg isn’t critical of AI-assisted bug reports in all cases. In September, he publicly applauded a researcher for sending a “massive list” of bugs that were found using a set of AI-assisted tools. The report had resulted in 22 bug fixes at the time.

In an interview, Stenberg said that the reporter, Joshua Rogers, mostly used AI-powered code analyzer ZeroPath.

“A clever person using a powerful tool,” Stenberg wrote. “I believe most of the worst reports we get are from people just asking an AI bot without caring or understanding much about what it reports.”

Unfortunately, such cases seem to be the exception. AI slop has already flooded music-streaming services with so many songs—often misattributed to real artists—that the platforms are slowly becoming unusable for music discovery. cURL’s move may be an early indication that something similar is happening to bug bounty programs.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Last year saw the highest vinyl record sales since 1984, signaling a strong desire among music enthusiasts to return to a simpler time of physical media.

Even cassette tapes are making a comeback, with major artists including Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift releasing their material on the iconic plastic, four-inch audio reels.

Now, self-described “party slam” metal band Party Cannon is taking the nostalgia play — often framed as an act of defiance against greedy and AI-slop-infested streaming platforms — to a new level.

The Scottish outfit announced that its new EP, “Subjected to a Partying,” will launch on a Nintendo N64 cartridge. Inventory, however, will be limited to just 100 copies.

“We are going where no slamming death metal band has gone before — Nintendo 64,” the band wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. “That’s right, it’s time to get N or get out.”

“To celebrate Daryl ‘The Frogman’ Boyce’s first release as our new vocalist, we decided to make it something truly special, and there’s nothing more special than a console that’s lifespan ended in 2001,” the band wrote.

The band appears to have touched a nerve, selling out its US inventory of the unique cartridges in less than a day.

It’s not exactly an ideal format for a new music release. Nintendo’s 64 Game Pak can hold up to just 64 megabytes, and the earliest versions were limited to a paltry 12 megabytes. Besides, you’ll need an N64 console and a TV with the right input to play the record.

As a result of those technical limitations, Party Cannon had to get creative, limiting the cartridge release to just four songs, while the full release will feature eight, including live tracks and remixes. However, the ROMs will also feature live video of a recent festival appearance at an era-appropriate resolution of just 320 by 240 pixels.

“Load up your N64 and have an IQ-lowering blast from the past,” reads the band’s tongue-in-cheek description on their website.

The audio quality has also taken a hit, judging by the band’s colorful description.

“[Vocalist] The Frogman sounds like unfettered pressurized sewerage pouring all over these tracks, and we couldn’t be happier with how disgusting these vocals are, it’s a new era of Party Slam,” the band gloated in its announcement.

It’s not the first time the metal band has released its music on an outdated gaming system. Last year, the band released a single on the Sega Genesis cartridge, a 16-bit console that was discontinued in 1999.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, a University of Alaska, Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained by police after ripping off pieces of AI-generated art that were hung up at a student art exhibit — and chewing them up in protest.

As the school’s student newspaper The Sun Star reported, undergraduate student Graham Granger was arrested for criminal mischief after masticating at least 57 of the 160 images that had been carefully arranged by fine arts student Nick Dwyer.

The incident was an eyebrow-raising illustration of the collective exhaustion with being surrounded by the outputs of generative AI, a fierce debate that has gripped the art world. Some, like Dwyer, see it as a powerful tool for self-expression. Others, like Granger, argue it’s quite the opposite, undermining human authorship and taking away from artists who don’t use AI for their work.

Now, in an interview with The Nation, Granger, a film and performing arts major, has spoken out about what motivated him to turn his teeth into weapons against the AI onslaught.

“It’s a protest against the school’s AI policy specifically and it’s performance art because I needed something that would elicit a reaction,” he told the publication. “So this could reach more people.”

It’s unclear which policy Granger was referring to exactly. The University of Alaska’s academic misconduct policy states that “work that is created by an artificial intelligence engine is covered by the student code of conduct.”

“Work submitted for credit that was created by AI-engines can be addressed using the academic misconduct portion of the student code of conduct,” the policy reads.

However, whether arts students are allowed or encouraged to make use of the tech remains unclear.

Granger also revealed that his act wasn’t premeditated, admitting that he didn’t even “know about the exhibit before that day.”

But once he spotted Dwyer’s work, a series of AI-generated images that explore “AI psychosis” and the crafting of false memories, he was appalled at what he saw, particularly when contrasted with other, non-AI art displayed at the exhibit.

“And then I saw the AI piece and it was just — as an artist myself, it was insulting to see something of such little effort alongside all these beautiful pieces in the gallery,” Granger told The Nation. “It shouldn’t be acceptable for this ‘art,’ if you will, to be put alongside these real great pieces.”

“It’s art that takes away from its own substance by not being made by the artist himself,” he argued.

“I think artificial intelligence is a very valuable tool,” Granger said. “I think that it has no place in the arts. It takes away a lot of the human effort that makes art.”

Dwyer appears to have a very different take on the matter. His defaced exhibit was meant to explore his own struggles with “AI psychosis,” a recently-coined term used by health professionals to describe the experience of people experiencing delusional episodes after using AI tools like ChatGPT.

Before they were chewed up by Granger, the pictures depicted Dwyer and his AI chatbot, which he says he fell in love with.

The incident left a bad taste in Dwyer’s mouth — sorry — comparing it in his remarks to The Nation to slashing someone’s tires to protest the oil industry.

However, Dwyer has since decided to drop the charges against Granger, admitting that he’s been trying to rely on generative AI less.

“I’m trying to wean myself off,” he told The Nation.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With a major winter storm about to blast pretty much every US state east of the Rocky Mountains, many are scrambling to prepare for the cold, ice, and snow.

And according to popular meteorology influencer Max Schuster, there’s yet another winter-weather hazard to watch out for: trees exploding in the frigid air.

On a viral post on X-formerly-Twitter, Schuster — who holds a meteorology degree and goes by “Max Velocity” on social media — declared an area of “exploding tree risk” across the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and northern Michigan.

“Exploding trees are possible in the Midwest and Northern Plains on Friday and Saturday, as temperatures are forecasted to fall 20 degrees below zero!” Schuster warned.

While the claim may sound far fetched, a number of legitimate publications have come out of the woodwork to back the assertion, suggesting that sap and moisture from within the trees can indeed expand so rapidly that the tree’s structure simply can’t hold it.

As with anything originating from the internet, the reality is more mundane than viral post suggests. Yes, it can and does happen — though midwestern forests aren’t about to start popping like corn kernels.

In an attempt to clear things up, Bill McNee, a forest health specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it’s not unheard of for rapid temperature drops to cause “frost cracks” in trees, which can be accompanied by a loud and unsettling “bang.”

“It’s going to get cold enough that this sap may actually finally freeze. And when it does that, like ice cubes in your freezer, they expand very quickly,” McNee told the Sentinel. “That just creates a lot of physical pressure that can lead to the frost cracking appearing suddenly, branches can fall off, and people hear this really loud crack from their tree, almost like it’s a gunshot.”

While these frost cracks can be large enough to cause a tree’s exterior tissue to literally explode, McNee says it’s “extremely rare.”

“I’ve never seen the damage of it,” McNee continued, “but from what I have seen and what I read online is that it is rare for there just to be so much pressure that is suddenly released inside this tree that it almost does explode.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If we were a top executive at X-formerly-Twitter, a social media site used by hundreds of millions of people which is known for its incredible levels of toxicity and ruthless trolling, we’d probably avoid sharing too many details from our personal lives on there — but that’s just us.

Anyway, on Wednesday, X’s head of product Nikita Bier shared some of the grueling tribulations inflicted on him by an uncooperative chunk of chicken, earning him instant ridicule.

“Ate a piece of fried chicken tonight. It somehow tore part of my throat going down,” Bier wrote in a now-deleted tweet. “Now I can barely swallow (or speak.)”

Adding to his woes, Bier said the doctor told him he couldn’t get an endoscopy for at least four to six weeks.

“This feels like a Kafka novel,” Bier added. (Is it just us, or is Kafka in the air this week?)

It certainly sucks to not be able to see a doctor for what could be a serious medical issue. But Bier’s tale earned little sympathy — and heapings of mockery — from X users. And it became a newsworthy enough item on there that it earned an official Grok-edited summary in the site’s trending tab, which also includes dozens of viral tweets roasting Bier’s (in)ability to chew food.

Much of the jeering centered on how culinary blockages appeared to be a recurring problem for Bier. In late December 2023, for example, Bier posted about how he had to go to the emergency room after getting a “piece of steak” stuck in his throat for four hours, which was dislodged within minutes after he was given a glucagon injection. (“Doctors are Gods,” Bier enthused at the time.)

Weeks later, Bier made another post complaining about the $1,400 bill he was slapped with after visiting a doctor for yet another piece of steak that got stuck in his throat, which just so happened to dislodge itself before the doctor could actually treat him.

A consultant who’s worked for numerous tech adjacent firms and has been hailed as a “king of virality,” Bier was appointed as head of product by Elon Musk in June last year, amid X losing advertisers and bleeding users. At the time, Bier joked he had “posted my way to the top.”

Before joining, Bier had also served as an adviser for the app Protector, a rent-a-mercenary service that allows you to hire a private detail of armed guards and drivers. Bier bluntly called it “Uber with guns.”

His time at X so far doesn’t appear to have really moved the needle much, as the site’s user base continues to be in steady decline over half a year on, with some data suggesting it’s been overtaken by Threads, Meta’s Twitter clone. But at least the users who’ve stuck around like him, right?

“The only man keeping this site afloat is someone who doesn’t seem to realize he needs to chew his food,” mocked one user. Another patronizingly described him as if he were a snake. “Nikita Bier dislocates his jaw and swallows food unchewed, relying on his powerful gastric acid to break down the meals over several weeks,” the user wrote. Brutal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX is facing a one-two punch of personal injury lawsuits after two different workers have sued the Elon Musk-owned company this month over being injured on the job, the San Antonio Express-News reports, adding to the poor safety track record at its Starbase facility in South Texas.

The latest suit, filed in Cameron County on Monday, was leveled against SpaceX and the steel firm W&W Erectors LLC by a subcontractor named Julian Escalante, who was working on one of the launchpads used by Starship — the largest rocket in the world, whose development is under massive pressure for being behind schedule.

According to the suit, Escalante’s right arm got “entangled and pinched” by a metal bucket holding “approximately 200 pounds” of industrial-sized bolts after it tumbled from a pallet.

“As the bucket fell, (Escalante’s) right arm was dragged downward with (the bucket),” the suit said, per the Express-News “The downward force pulled (his) right shoulder, and (he) fell with the bucket as it hit the ground.”

Just as concerning as the accident, which took place in November, was his higher ups’ alleged response to it. When Escalante reported it to his supervisor, the supervisor told him “not to report the injury and instructed him to return to work,” the suit claims, and his foreman, Joe Pedroza, had basically the same advice: “Just don’t tell anyone.”

But Escalante wanted medical care for his injury. His inquiries into where management stood on his request allegedly didn’t fly well with the General Foreman, identified only as “Wero,” who told Escalante to “be a man” and “stop crying,” according to the suit. His lawyers say that SpaceX was negligent in maintaining a safe job site.

A similar lawsuit was filed earlier this month by a worker named Sergio Ortiz, the Express-News reported, who says that in 2024 he was struck by falling debris while working in an elevator shaft at Starbase. According to the suit, the heavy cables used by welding machines called welding leads, which can weigh up to 80 pounds, fell from above and slammed his head.

The suits are the latest to put the safety track record of SpaceX under the microscope. For years, it’s faced suits for accidents and even deaths, including a botched rocket test that left one employee in a permanent coma when a piece of one of Starship’s engines flew off and fractured his skull. A Reuters investigation in 2023 found at least 600 cases of workplace injuries at SpaceX that went unreported.

The company is under intense pressure to perfect Starship, which NASA has selected to perform a lunar landing in its upcoming Artemis III mission — a role that’s now under some doubt.

The company also allegedly has a track record of retaliating against employees. It has faced several lawsuits over sexual harassment, including some that implicated CEO Musk. In a 2024 lawsuit, eight former employees accused the company of illegally firing them after raising concerns over sexual harassment.

It’s not the only Musk-owned venture facing similar legal allegations, either. His automaker Tesla has also been hit with numerous lawsuits over brutal working conditions and workplace accidents, joined by widespread accounts of Musk impulsively firing employees in fits of rage, and allegedly threatening to deport an engineer for raising a critical safety issue.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/white-house-ai-protester">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The White House published an image on X in which the face of a protester had been altered using AI to depict her weeping during her arrest — instead of striking a stoic pose, as she actually looked during the event.

The woman in the image, civil rights attorney and organizer Nekima Levy Armstrong, was arrested this week after interrupting a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota. The protesters were calling for the resignation of a pastor at the church, whom they say is the acting director of an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in St. Paul, Minnesota. Levy Armstrong and other protesters are now being charged with federal conspiracy and intimidation charges, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump Administration officials have repeatedly characterized the protest as a “riot” and an attack on Christian worshipers; speaking to CNN on Wednesday before her arrest, Levy Armstrong defended the action as a “peaceful nonviolent demonstration.”

On Thursday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem published a photo on X of Levy Armstrong’s arrest. Levy Armstrong appears to be handcuffed as she was escorted through an office space by a federal agent. In this image, Levy Armstrong isn’t crying. She’s also wearing bright pink lipstick, and her mouth is closed.

Roughly 30 minutes later, things got decidedly more bizarre when the official White House X account also published an image on X purportedly depicting Levy Armstrong’s arrest. But in this version of the photo, Levy Armstrong is pictured sobbing, with visible tears streaming down her cheeks and her mouth open. Her pink lipstick, notably, is gone.

“ARRESTED,” reads large, bolded text, inserted over the image of Levy Armstrong allegedly sobbing. “FAR LEFT AGITATOR NEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG FOR ORCHESTRATING CHURCH RIOTS IN MINNESOTA.”

Everything else about the image, however, is the same, including the positioning of Levy Armstrong’s body, the agent, and the background.

As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale soon confirmed, the image had been altered to make it look as though Levy Armstrong was crying during her arrest.

Can you please provide comment on why this image was manipulated using AI to make it appear that the woman was crying? pic.twitter.com/Z2anIsoLan

Journalists and lawyers, among others, were quick to point out the discrepancy, taking to social media to show the stark difference between the two images.

The White House posted an edited photo of the activist involved in the Minneapolis church protest, made to look like she was crying.

Futurism contacted both the White House and the Department of Homeland Security to ask whether generative AI was used to alter the image, but hasn’t immediately received a reply.

According to Dale, when reached for comment, the White House responded with a link to a post from an administration spokesperson reading: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”

In its initial post, however, the White House made no attempt to clarify that the photo had been altered, nor did its presentation suggest in any way that it wasn’t real. It was presented as exactly that: a photo. In this context, to categorize this action — the undisclosed and unflattering altering of a photo of the arrest of an American citizen who has been charged with a federal crime but not yet tried or convicted in court, published on an official White House information channel — as a “meme” is, at best, disingenuous. At worst, it’s a revisionist lie intended to influence public opinion and the information ecosystem.

To that end, it’s unclear why the White House would feel the need to alter an arrest photo in this way, other than to portray a different reality of Levy Armstrong’s detainment — that is, if the reality of the photo published by Noem didn’t suit the administration and its aims.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google Photos will now let you make memes with your own images. On Thursday, Google introduced a new generative AI-powered feature called “Me Meme,” which will allow you to combine a photo template and an image of yourself to generate an image of the meme.

The new addition, which will be first available to U.S.-based users, was originally spotted in development last October by the blog Android Authority. It was formally announced by Google via its Photos Community site on Thursday.

The &quot;Me meme&quot; feature which I spotted back in October 2025 is finally announced by Google. This is an experimental feature which will be available first for users in US only 😐Here is the announcement forum posts- https://t.co/7P2JgJhoBk https://t.co/E60prcqcie pic.twitter.com/sFICxzVIPU

According to Google, the feature is experimental, so generated images “may not perfectly match the original photo.” It suggests uploading well-lit, focused, and front-facing photos to get the best results.

The addition is meant to just be a fun way to explore your photos and experiment with Google’s Gemini AI technology, and specifically Nano Banana. Google’s popular AI image model powers other AI features in the Google Photos app, like the ability to re-create images in new styles, such as cartoons or paintings.

Though a fairly unserious addition, all things considered, these types of features help remind users to return to the Photos app whenever they want to play around with AI tools, rather than going to a competitor’s product.

Plus, users tend to gravitate toward features that show themselves in AI edits, as OpenAI found with its successful launch of the Sora app, which lets you make AI videos that can include yourself and your friends.

“Me Meme” isn’t fully rolled out, so you may not see it in your updated Google Photos app just yet. When available, it will appear under the “Create” tab, Google says.

To use the feature, you’ll select a template or upload your own, then tap “add photo” and “Generate.” Google notes that more templates are being added over time.  After the AI creates the image, you can save the photo, share it on other platforms, or tap “regenerate” to have it re-imagine the image a second time.

            <h2>Meta pauses teen access to AI characters as it develops a specially tailored version</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/meta-pauses-teen-access-to-ai-characters-as-it-develops-a-specially-tailored-version/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta today said that it is pausing teens’ access to its AI characters globally across all its apps. The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts, but wants to develop a special version of an AI character for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.

The move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go on trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of a lack of effort in protecting kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. Wired reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media’s impact on teen mental health, along with stories

In October, Meta rolled out new parental control features, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps. These new features, which were inspired by the PG-13 movie rating, restricted teen access to certain topics like extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.

Days later, the company also previewed controls for AI characters, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said at that time parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters as well. These features were set to release this year, but Meta is now taking a hardened approach of turning off AI characters altogether. Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, and it decided to pause the access.

“Starting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready. This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,” the company said in an updated blog post.

Meta added that when it finally rolls out the new teen-specific AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.

Social media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is also facing a trial next week, accusing the platform of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.

Besides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18. In November, the startup said it would build interactive stories for kids. In the last few months, OpenAI added new teen safety rules for ChatGPT and also started predicting a user’s age to apply content restrictions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.

On Thursday, January 22, 2026, TikTok announced that the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC had officially been established to comply with President Trump’s executive order that approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. Now, ByteDance will own less than 20% of the new entity, with the rest of it falling into non-Chinese ownership.

Over the years, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension, facing uncertainty about how their access to the app would change — for creators who use TikTok to make a living, the stakes were even higher. Last year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store on February 2, 2025.

A number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after President Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle finally ceased. In December 2025, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.

Earlier in 2025, President Trump had announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.

ByteDance will retain nearly a 20% stake in the company, while non-Chinese investors will hold the remaining 80% of ownership of the TikTok USDS Joint Venture.

The managing investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. These three investors will each hold 15% of the U.S. operation, or 45% collectively.

Other investors, which include existing ByteDance investors, make up another 35% of the venture’s ownership. This includes the Dell Family Office (Michael Dell’s investment firm), Susquehanna affiliate Vastmere, Alpha Wave Partners, and several more, which are listed in TikTok’s press release.

Reports estimate that TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion — a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.

The newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.

Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to a memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.

A White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.

ByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.

Since the deal was only just finalized, it’s not clear exactly how the 200 million American TikTok users will be impacted.

While earlier reports suggested that U.S. users might need to transition to a new platform, more recent reports have denied this claim, assuring users that they will not need to download a new app.

It’s also unclear how users’ algorithmic feeds will be impacted at this time.

To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.

The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.

A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.

Things began to progress even more following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.

In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.

Fast-forward to 2024: Trump had a change of heart since his first term and sought to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.

There were several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok, a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group had the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters included Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.

Another group, called the American Investor Consortium, was led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.

Others in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/this-startup-will-send-1000-peoples-ashes-to-space-affordably-in-2027/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ryan Mitchell, the founder of a startup called Space Beyond, remembers looking at the night sky while camping at a state park and wondering what he should do next.

A manufacturing engineer who worked on NASA’s space shuttle program before spending nearly a decade at Jeff Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, Mitchell was considering his options. In those jobs, he had seen the cost to access space come down dramatically, thanks in large part to Blue Origin’s rival SpaceX. Those stars in the sky, he thought, seemed closer than ever.

Mitchell told TechCrunch that an idea finally clicked when he was attending a family member’s ash-spreading ceremony.

“When it was over, we were kind of like, ‘now what?’ The moment was gone,” he said. He remembered thinking: “How could I do this better?”

That, he said, was the beginning of building Space Beyond and its “Ashes to Space” program, which will use a CubeSat, a class of miniature cube-shaped satellites, to send as many as 1,000 people’s ashes to space in one go. On Thursday, Space Beyond announced it signed a launch services agreement with Arrow Science and Technology, which will integrate the CubeSat on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission scheduled for October 2027.

Sending people’s ashes to space is not a new idea. Companies like Celestis have been doing it since the 1990s. What Mitchell said is different about Space Beyond is that it’s doing it affordably — with its cheapest offering coming in at just $249. Other options typically cost in the thousands of dollars. (That said, customers will need to have the cremation performed elsewhere.)

Mitchell said Space Beyond has achieved this a few ways. Foremost is the rideshare model, which has greatly democratized access to space in general. Companies can now develop small CubeSats that get integrated into larger spacecraft for a fraction of the total price to hitch a ride on a Falcon 9, allowing for all sorts of new science and small-scale commercial missions.

But Space Beyond is also bootstrapped and not trying to generate big returns for investors.

“I’ve been told I’m not charging enough for this service,” he said, especially when considering how the funeral industry is built around over-charging people at one of their most vulnerable moments. “But I’m not looking to take over the world, and I’m not looking to make a billion dollars doing this.”

There are limits to what Space Beyond can offer, given the CubeSat format. For one, customers will only be able to send about one gram’s worth of ashes to space. This allows for the startup to fit enough customers’ ashes on board to make the idea financially viable. But it’s also a result of the fact that — despite the easier access to space — weight is still a huge consideration for launch providers like SpaceX.

Space Beyond’s CubeSat will also only be in orbit for about five years, so this is not a memorial that will last forever.

But Mitchell said there are benefits to this approach. The company’s CubeSat will be in what’s known as a “sun-synchronous orbit,” which is at a very high altitude of around 550 kilometers (or around 341 miles). This allows the satellite to fly over the entire globe. With many modern spacecraft tracking services available, customers should be able to locate the CubeSat and know when it is in the night sky above their home.

A five-year limit also means that the aluminum CubeSat and the ashes onboard will ultimately meet a fiery end as it burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere upon re-entry — a nice symbolic ending, Mitchell said, even if there’s no guarantee that customers will be able to see the resulting fireball.

Space Beyond will also never physically spread a customer’s ashes in space. That would be “almost a nightmare scenario,” Mitchell said, as the particles could create a debris cloud that could doom other spacecraft. But given that customers can only send around one gram per space, they’ll be able to do what they want with the rest of a loved one’s ashes.

When Mitchell left Blue Origin last year, he said he filled “several pages” of a notebook with ideas of what to do next. The range was wide, including options like trying to be a launch director at another space company, or becoming a Kava bartender. Something kept pulling him back to this one, though.

“I tried to talk myself out of [this idea] for a long time. I thought it would be too expensive or too difficult,” he explained. But he said it just made sense to him “every time I put actual engineering rigor to it, figured out what the requirements are, and what the business case is.”

It was also the idea that he was clearly most obsessed with. “My wife said: ‘I could have told you that weeks ago. You can’t stop talking about this,’” he said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/microsoft-gave-fbi-a-set-of-bitlocker-encryption-keys-to-unlock-suspects-laptops-reports/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.

Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.

But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.

The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.

A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.

Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.

“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emily is a college student by day, but she works the night shift at the strip club to pay her tuition – she doesn’t think anyone will find out her secret, until one day, her mysterious English teacher shows up! Did he recognize her? Will her secret get out? Pay 60 “tokens” to see what happens next, or you can watch an ad, or… just buy a VIP pass for $20 per week and skip the ads altogether.

These stories are pulpy and exaggerated, bursting with cringeworthy acting and writing. Yet these “microdramas” – TikTok-like shows with episodes about a minute long – are making billions of dollars a year.

First popular in China, microdrama apps are poised to have a breakout year in the U.S. app market. According to the app intelligence firm Appfigures, ReelShort reached roughly $1.2 billion in gross consumer spending in 2025, up 119% from 2024; another leading app, DramaBox, made $276 million in gross consumer spending last year, more than doubling its 2024 numbers.

The market doesn’t appear to be slowing down. TikTok just launched its own standalone microdrama app called PineDrama, and a new app from Hollywood veterans called GammaTime just raised $14 million, including checks from angel investors like Alexis Ohanian, Kris Jenner, and Kim Kardashian.

It’s surprising to see short-form, scripted drama apps achieve such success when we’re only five years removed from the implosion of Quibi. Quibi wanted to be like Netflix, but with ten-minute episodes that were designed to be watched on the go. Founded by Dreamworks co-founder and former Disney chair Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi raised more than $1.75 billion in funding from major Hollywood studios, then created shows with stars like Liam Hemsworth, Reese Witherspoon, and Anna Kendrick.

No one wanted Quibi, and the app turned into a punchline because of how massively it flopped. But ReelShort –- an app whose top shows are called “My Sister is the Warlord Queen” and “In Love with a Single Farmer-Daddy” –- is a hit.

“How are they succeeding where Quibi failed? They’re basically OnlyFans for the female gaze,” Eric Wei, creator economy expert and CEO of Karat Financial, told TechCrunch. “They do romantasy, where the titles are all like, ‘My Alpha.’ This is like ‘50 Shades of Grey,’ but for vertical video.”

OnlyFans isn’t the best comparison (these shows can be suggestive, though not pornographic), but Wei is right that sex sells. When a story seems like it might be heating up, you’ll be prompted to watch ads or pay money to keep going. But the payoff is never that compelling, so you keep watching, only to see another pop-up asking for more money, or other ambiguous in-app currency.

The business model behind these apps replicates the same dark patterns as mobile games. They’re designed to get users hooked on free content, giving out free in-app currency for logging in each day. As people spend more time on the app – which is designed to be addictive – they need more coins or tokens to unlock more episodes of a show, but there’s no way to earn enough to get their fix without shelling out real money.

Sometimes, a microdrama is interactive, allowing viewers to choose what route the story will take – but the good option (the woman stands up to her abusive ex) will cost tokens, while the less satisfying one (the abusive ex faces no consequences for his actions) is free.

Soon, a hooked viewer may relent and pay for the weekly $20 ad-free pass, which, after a month, would cost more than subscriptions to HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Paramount Plus combined.

As AI enters the picture, these companies will churn out content at an even more alarming pace. LLMs are not capable of writing prestige dramas like HBO’s “Succession,” or even a sitcom like “The Big Bang Theory,” but the most successful microdramas are so predictable and formulaic that they don’t actually require much human wit and creativity. You’d be shocked to learn how many microdramas begin with a scene in which a girl with glasses gets pushed down by a mean classmate, only to be saved by some popular jock, who notices she’s actually really pretty if she just takes off her glasses.

PocketFM, the Lightspeed-backed audio-series platform, has already embraced AI. Last year, it released a tool it calls CoPilot, which was trained on thousands of hours of content to understand the “beats” of a formulaic story, helping writers add cliffhangers or plot twists to their stories that it predicts will make audiences want to watch more. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian company Holywater, which raised $22 million to fund its microdrama app My Drama, calls itself an “AI-first entertainment network.”

While microdrama could fully go the way of AI, Dhar Mann Studios CEO Sean Atkins thinks there’s also an opportunity for creators.

“Think about it – short-form is a little less overhead than long-form, and vertical is even more overhead,” Atkins told TechCrunch. “I think you’ll see a handful of creators start going into that pretty significantly, particularly since they have the experience of low-cost production.”

These companies have a great business model on their hands. But it’s one that thrives on short attention spans, in-app purchases, and content that feels like “Cocomelon” for adults.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In late 1967, a young Nicaraguan American UCLA graduate named Patrick Arguello wrote to a friend about the death of Ernesto “Che” Guevara. The insurgent leader had been killed in Bolivia by CIA-trained Special Forces while trying to raise the rural masses against their right-wing government. Che was a hero of Arguello’s, and he was devastated by the news. But Che’s death did not signal “the end of the struggle,” Arguello wrote. Soon Arguello was running errands for the Sandinistas, and in 1970 he was shot and killed by an Israeli air marshal as he attempted to hijack a plane on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

At almost exactly the same time, the execution of another ideologue inspired another young man to join the cause of revolutionary violence. Ayman al-Zawahiri, an introverted and intense child of a well-to-do family in Cairo, was a teenager when he learned that Syed Qutb, a senior official in the Muslim Brotherhood, had been hanged in prison. Qutb was a melancholic, misogynistic former bureaucrat and literary critic who’d been accused of trying to assassinate the Egyptian president. While behind bars, he had written a book, Milestones, which called for a renewal of faith among Muslims and a purging of Western influences—consumerism, moral decadence, capitalism. This message resonated with al-Zawahiri, who soon formed a cell dedicated to implementing Qutb’s ideas through violence. He went on to become one of the most infamous Islamist militants in the world, eventually leading al-Qaeda until he was killed by a U.S. missile in Kabul in 2022.

From the April 2023 issue: The new anarchy

Many assume that modern Islamist extremism emerged only after the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In fact, it began to gather force 20 years earlier, at a time of much wider revolutionary ferment, when leftist movements were already flourishing. Leftists rejected religion entirely. Islamists reviled Communists and the Soviet Union. Their social conservatism contrasted dramatically with leftists values, particularly about gender.

And yet, the two movements had a surprising—and often overlooked—amount in common. Both worshipped heroic martyrs who had urged the masses to rise up, overthrow their rulers, and transform society. Both called for “armed struggle” against imperialism, capitalism, the U.S., and Israel, and included some who saw terrorist attacks as shortcuts to major change. Followers of each were often encouraged to challenge the authority of parents, professors, mainstream scholars, and governments.

That these two movements shared certain beliefs and strategies was not purely coincidental, the result of small groups trying to take on greatly superior governments. In some cases, the leftists directly influenced the Islamists. (The reverse was not true in any meaningful sense.) Qutb was steeped in the anti-colonial narratives of his time. Youthful clerics in Iran admired “freedom fighters” in Africa. In Lebanon in the 1970s, leftist instructors trained Iranian Islamists dedicated to the overthrow of the shah, passing on techniques that they had refined over a decade or more. Other Iranian Islamists closely studied Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla, a 1969 instructional text by the Brazilian Marxist revolutionary Carlos Marighella. In the ’70s, Islamists took over embassies, and in the ’80s, they hijacked planes—both tactics popularized by secular leftist groups.

Some vocabulary crossed over from the left to the religious right, too, particularly among Iranian thinkers and groups who tried to reconcile Marxist and Islamist language and ideas. The man who established the radical clerical regime in Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini, talked about “revolution,” using the Persian term mostazafin to describe the oppressed, miserable, or exploited—which came, via a key Iranian radical thinker, from a translation of Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth. A smaller opposition group in Iran called the Mojahedin-e Khalq also studied Fanon’s writings, along with those of Che and Lenin. Its members worked hard to meld leftist ideologies with Islamic beliefs, recasting stories familiar to Shiite Muslims as parables of “armed struggle.” A group handbook stated: “We say ‘no’ to Marxist philosophy, especially atheism. But we say ‘yes’ to Marxist social thought, particularly to its analysis of feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism.”

Islamist extremism has become so closely associated with resolutely conservative values that many people don’t realize how much the Islamists borrowed from the leftists. Many Islamists subscribed, explicitly or not, to Che’s doctrine of foquismo, which argued that a small number of committed militants could create the conditions for revolution. A former leader of the Fedayeen-e Khalq, a leftist organisation in Iran that opposed the shah in the ’70s, told me that when its militants tried to launch an insurgent campaign shortly after Che’s death, they followed his playbook, attacking a remote gendarme post in the hopes of sparking a rural insurrection. Similarly, the Islamist extremists who in 1974 sought to overthrow the regime of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat were banking on the fact that a bold, violent action, which they called an “outrage for God,” would provoke a mass uprising, achieving in an instant what would otherwise take decades of preaching and social work.

For all their similarities and convergences, these two movements ultimately followed very different trajectories. In Western Europe, sweeping social and political reforms answered many of the demands of those who had taken to the streets. More effective security measures, widespread revulsion at extremist violence, and the popularity of new causes such as environmentalism meant that violent leftist groups seeking a “revolution” were marginalized by the early ’80s. There was still a great deal of terrorism, of course, but little that aimed at total transformation on a national or global scale.

Leftists in the Middle East were marginalized too—though for different reasons. In the 1960s, many young people across the region had been drawn in by the progressive ideals and anti-imperialism of the left. But without political reforms to address citizens’ grievances, the decade that followed offered little but disappointment, disillusionment, and the brutal repression of leftist organizations and ideas.

This crackdown created a vacuum that allowed Islamism to take hold. In 1973, the U.S. ambassador to Tehran sent a memo to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger describing “a swing toward conservative Islamic principles” in parts of the Arab world that was so pronounced, even leftists were “giving lip-service” to religion. Two years later, the CIA claimed that the major Arab countries were entering a “post-revolutionary era.” This was a miscalculation. One revolutionary ideology was dying, but another had been born. By 1978, the British travel writer Jan Morris was writing in Rolling Stone about “the revolution I find easiest to envisage in Cairo now”—one that would come not from the left but “from the arsenals of Islam.”

From the November 2002 issue: Home thoughts from abroad

Morris proved prescient. In 1979, a radical clerical regime took power in Iran, and a messianic militant group stormed and held the Great Mosque in Mecca. In 1981, Islamist extremist networks killed President Sadat—the culmination of multiple efforts across a decade. A year later, the various factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was broadly secular and nationalist, and included radical leftists, were dispersed by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Not long after, massive suicide bombs launched by new Islamist groups—groups that would eventually merge to form Hezbollah—destroyed the U.S. embassy in Beirut and killed hundreds of Marines at the city’s international airport. Several of those behind the blasts had once belonged to secular, left-leaning factions—though their desire to cause mass casualties and their willingness to sacrifice their own comrades was dramatically new.

The late ’60s to the early ’80s was a period unlike today in many ways—a period when terrorists wanted “a lot of people watching and not a lot of people dead,” in the words of one contemporary commentator; when terrorist groups held press conferences and governments frequently met their demands; when a forged passport was enough to slip through an international frontier; and when wanted militants could disappear for months if not years unless they did something rash or were very unlucky.

But the parallels between then and now are striking. Those decades were a time of rapid and destabilizing change. Technological innovations, particularly in the media, exposed hundreds of millions of people to shocking images, radical ideas, and extreme opinions, sowing distrust and dislocation. Conspiracy theories and paranoia flourished. Great powers struggled for global dominance. The Middle East was mired in conflict and the West faced economic distress. Then, as now, many young people felt that their elders had betrayed them, and that wholesale change was called for. A small number of these people felt that violence was the only way to achieve it.

If we’re to take anything from that earlier period, it’s that violence can be avoided if calls for radical change are given a political outlet. If governments ignore people’s needs and demands, the violence will soon return. It might be perpetrated by different people, with different words, ideas, tactics, and values, but they’re sure to be equally determined to remake their world, whatever the cost.

Three days into 2026, the United States military seized a foreign leader: Nicolás Maduro. Four days after that, the U.S. health department freed a longtime prisoner of war: saturated fats.

At a recent press conference announcing the publication of the government’s new dietary guidelines, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared two different military operations in the span of less than a minute: The nation would be retreating from its war on fatty steaks and whole milk, he said, and redeploying for another war, this one on added sugars. News about a third campaign arrived a few days later, when the White House shared a dark and menacing photo of Kennedy with the caption “WE ARE ENDING THE WAR ON PROTEIN.”

This appears to be what happens when someone who has spent years fighting mainstream medicine suddenly finds himself at the center of it. Like a revolutionary turned generalissimo, Kennedy has transformed the former palace into a military command center. He has promised to defeat his enemies in Big Pharma and to purge conflicts of interest from the agencies he leads, so as to end what he has referred to as a “war on public health.” Elsewhere he has promised to withdraw from the “war on alternative medicine,” the “war on stem cells,” the “war on chelating drugs,” the “war on peptides,” the “war on vitamins,” and the “war on minerals.” Anything that his administration hopes to do may now be put in terms of martial conflict: Under Kennedy, policy making and saber rattling go hand in hand.

Kennedy’s deputies and chief advisers are culture warriors in their own right, and they seem to share their leader’s bellicosity. Jim O’Neill, the second in command at HHS, has talked about the need to fight back against gender-affirming medical care, which he describes as being part of an evil war on biology; Mehmet Oz, now in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, says that he will “wage a war on fraud, waste, and abuse”; and Calley Means, a top Kennedy advisor, points to an admittedly less catchy “war on the American public having transparency,” which the secretary intends to halt.

This repeated phrasing is more than just a rhetorical tic, and it extends far beyond the typical military analogies—like the wars on cancer and smoking—that have long been embedded in health discussions. As Kennedy and his aides press their case in public, they adopt a persistently antagonistic tone not only toward disease but also toward the medical and scientific establishment. It is as if anyone who has disagreed with the administration must be an enemy combatant. The current HHS regime has already taken shots at supposedly corrupt pediatricians, conflicted ob-gyns, “fake news” science journalists, and “sock puppet” regulators. (In response to questions about the department’s aggressive posture, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard asserted that Americans’ trust in public health has been declining, and that Kennedy is restoring it.)

RFK Jr. has, in this regard, been a rather effective secretary of war. He has quickly put the old medical establishment on the defensive. My colleagues in academia and medicine are worried about what might happen to them if they write one of the government’s newly forbidden words in a scientific grant or provide the wrong sort of medical care to their transgender patients; venerable scientific outlets such as The New England Journal of Medicine have had to deal with letters from a government lawyer accusing them of bias; and earlier this month, an ex-FDA official nervously joked that he hoped that the IRS wouldn’t audit his taxes as punishment for criticizing agency operations.

When it comes to public-health advice, Kennedy’s agenda has proved to be more focused on attacking previous suggestions than promoting new ones. “Prior guidelines were driven not by health interests,” Kennedy said in a Fox News interview this month, “but by mercantile interests of the food industry.” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary frames his agency’s actions as “setting the record straight” after years of dogma, and NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya—an author of the anti-lockdown “Great Barrington Declaration”—remains engaged in a heated struggle against COVID-related restrictions that ended years ago. On the whole, the administration appears to have adopted a Promethean view of science and medicine: New knowledge is not gradually discovered, but rather rescued from the grasp of special interests by an elite squadron of iconoclasts.

The contrarian brigade sometimes seems to be waging a war on irony itself. Despite the secretary’s repeated promises to wipe out conflicts of interest, some of the experts who advised on the new dietary guidelines have financial ties to the meat and dairy industries. (When those ties were first reported, HHS responded with a statement calling it “absurd to suggest that anything other than gold standard science guided our work on this presidential priority.”) Makary, an avid podcast guest, has used his airtime to issue devastating takedowns of nutrition education, only to be interrupted by advertisements for unproven dietary supplements. Vinay Prasad, another top FDA official and medical provocateur, has joined Makary on the agency’s FDA Direct podcast for what they called a “bashing session” of The Wall Street Journal’s opinion desk—which has a long history of publishing Makary, Bhattacharya, and Kennedy.

Rousing citizens with patriotic calls to battle is a tried-and-true political strategy, but the hostility generated by this public-health administration may not be sustainable. Adrenaline surges don’t last forever, and overreliance on extreme rhetoric will flatten important differences between public-health problems. Repeated attempts to discredit trusted medical experts may also backfire. Earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily prevented the government from terminating millions of dollars in public-health grants awarded to the American Academy of Pediatrics. In her ruling, Judge Beryl Howell cited multiple combative social-media posts made by HHS officials and advisers against the physician group. At the very least, the MAHA strategy of picking fights against the nation’s primary care doctors, news outlets, and career officials is unlikely to inspire a resurgence of the public’s trust. Outrage over skim milk and Froot Loops can only go so far, and Americans may soon grow tired of Kennedy’s forever wars.</div>

Joan Brugge has worked for nearly 50 years as a cancer scientist, studying the earliest signs that someone might become sick. Then the Trump administration canceled her lab’s funding. The administration’s attacks on medicine, culture, and education—which include verbal threats and funding cuts—are about more than just budgeting and bravado. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and the author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present. She argues that this effort is part of a larger autocratic project to maintain power.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Joan Brugge: I was actually at a breast-cancer retreat. And during the coffee break, I looked at my emails to see, you know, if there’s anything that I had to deal with. And I got this email from the university, and it was a real gut punch. My knees basically buckled, and I had to sit down.

Brugge: I never imagined that it would be possible that funding for lifesaving research would be terminated for issues that were totally unrelated to the quality of the work or the progress that we had made in the work.

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I am asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result.

Today’s episode examines the administration’s attacks on science, medicine, culture, and education—a combination of verbal threats and funding cuts that look very much like an attempt to control knowledge. Maybe there’s a broader goal, too: to build distrust, and, ultimately, to reshape all Americans’ perceptions of reality. I know that sounds dramatic, but I spent many years writing about authoritarian regimes, and almost all of them try to undermine admired institutions, in order to radically alter the way people think.

Let’s start with the attacks on science. Joan Brugge was stunned when her research became a target:

Brugge: I’ve been doing cancer research for almost 50 years now, not just at Harvard. When I was at undergrad, my sister was diagnosed with a highly aggressive brain tumor. I’ve been moving forward from that ever since. It’s definitely been a compass that’s been directing my life’s work.

The research projects in our lab involve studies of finding better ways to detect and destroy cells that are the earliest precursors of breast cancer, and to design treatments that can eliminate them so that we could try to prevent them from progressing to cancer. It’s like we’re detectives, like, you go in and there was a bank robbery, and you gotta figure out who did it. We’re trying to figure out what genes are responsible for causing this cancer, and how do they do it?

It was May of 2025 when I found out that both of my research grants were terminated. A few days after we first got the notices, it was like walking through a morgue, because all the faculty and staff from the labs were, just, almost paralyzed by the consequences of this.

It’s shocking and demoralizing to have to deal with this.

One of the impacts of the terminations was that instead of guiding my lab towards the studies to prevent or treat cancer, I’ve been extremely distracted by efforts to try to raise money to support the lab. Since last May, seven people have left the lab, but I only have sufficient funding to be able to replace two of them.

It’s funny; I think it gets emotional here, just ’cause this is what we’re living with and it’s just so difficult. It doesn’t feel right that Americans are going to be deprived of the outcome from this research.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat: We have a very focused and intense effort across the board to set America back a generation, at least, for education, health, research, climate policy.

Applebaum: Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and the author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present.

Ben-Ghiat: The thing many people don’t understand is that autocrats think about governments in a totally different way. Public welfare and accountability are not of interest to autocrats. It’s about amassing power, staying in power as long as you can, and enriching yourself.

Applebaum: Ruth, of all the changes made by this administration, it seems to me that the attack on science is the strangest. I can’t even think of other places where this has happened in recent memory.

Ben-Ghiat: I’ve been trying, since the start of this administration in January 2025, to figure out where it is following the classic autocratic playbook and what, instead, is new or novel. There are two things that stand out as new to me. One is the speed of change, really the speed at which institutions have been destroyed.

Ben-Ghiat: Research has been destroyed. Whole areas of knowledge and policy have been set back. It doesn’t correspond to any other example I know where the leader came to power via elections.

It doesn’t correspond to the first 10 months of Putin, Orbán, Erdoğan—none of them.

Applebaum: To a lot of Americans, it feels like these attacks are coming out of the blue. How do you explain them? How do you explain their origin? Why are these things the focus of Trump or his acolytes’ interest?

Ben-Ghiat: Well, they only come out of the blue if you ignored what was going on during Trump 1.0. Many of these fanatic causes and the people involved in them, such as Stephen Miller and others, were active then. And it was simply that they were only able to push these things so far, and now they feel free and empowered to push this through. The speed at which these parallel wars on American institutions and science and knowledge are happening resemble not the aftermath of an election, but when people come to power via coup. And, in fact, in some areas, like the universities or science, the Trump administration has acted more swiftly than people did, for example, Pinochet’s regime after a coup. They didn’t start a lot of their large-scale changes to the economy and education for a year or two. So here we have something that’s been planned for a long time.

And then the other thing I would mention is that they used their power when they were out of office beautifully. And by partnering with the Heritage Foundation—Project 2025—when he won the election, they were able to hit the ground running.

Applebaum: And is the purpose of this attack to diminish academic institutions themselves, or is it to do with the people who work for them?

Ben-Ghiat: It’s both. If we take the example of education institutions, of course you wanna go after individuals. And so every autocrat ends up purging any kind of critic. Certain fields of knowledge must go, and others are actually replaced. So you have a reform of institutions at the curricular level, such as Italy and Germany under the fascist period, made huge investments in demographics, in eugenics, racial engineering, and other subjects—and people who taught them had to go. But also, at a structural level, you want to change the tenor of the institution. You want to make educational institutions into places where you don’t have free thinking, critical thinking, and curiosity, as you would in democracies. Instead, the education institution itself becomes a place that breeds the values of authoritarianism: suspicion, hostility. And so every regime invests in having student informers.

And when I start my classes now at New York University, the first day, if they’re about authoritarianism or fascism, I look out at the students and I say, If this were an authoritarian state, one of you or two of you would be informing on each other. And another would be assigned to inform on me, as the instructor.

So it’s curriculum; it’s personnel. But the very conception of the institution must change, and it must become realigned and recast to fit in with the larger goals of that state.

Applebaum: And in this case, what do you mean by “larger goals”?

Ben-Ghiat: Well, this is what I call, and others call, personalist rule, under the Trump administration. Under personalist rule, you have, obviously, a very strong leader, and everyone has to pay tribute to him. Some people call this patrimonialism. I use personalism. And so educational institutions have to be compliant to him.

Applebaum: Ruth, several academics have told me that they believe cuts in funding for university-scientific research are really not about science but about the humanities. They fear that the administration thinks it can use federal funding to influence the kinds of courses universities teach, the students they enroll, the people they hire, ultimately the thoughts that they generate. But still, this doesn’t quite explain why an American president would want to destroy the most powerful engine of innovation in our economy, and maybe the world, which is our universities and their research departments. Why would they want to stifle lifesaving cancer research? Also, why would any government want its people not to be vaccinated? I’m not sure there are any other examples in the modern world, or even in recent history.

Ben-Ghiat: I agree. I can’t find any examples either, although we have examples of people such as [Jair] Bolsonaro, when he was president [of Brazil], trying to dissuade people during COVID that—he said, it was just “a little flu.” So this is a way to attack science, most obviously; a way to spread conspiracy theories.

We’ve seen attempts to smear and discredit scientists, librarians, teachers, judges, journalists. Anybody who works with empirical-research protocols, fact-based methods, scientific methods, investigations—all of them must go. And a very terrifying void opens up that is filled by fear, by conspiracy theories, or by nothing, where people don’t have any recourse against disease—creating conditions so that with the CDC and NIH and all the other infrastructure of science, if there is an outbreak of mass disease, we’ll be completely undefended. So it’s really, almost, a totalitarian—I don’t use that word lightly—effort to change the mindset of people away from science and fact-based research, across the board.

Applebaum: Of course, totalitarian leaders in the past did try to use schools and universities and research institutions to create an alternative reality. Stalin wanted to build a world in which everything he said was automatically accepted as true and nobody ever questioned him. Hitler manipulated science to prove his theories about race. But still, both of them were interested in engineering, in nuclear technology, in energy technology. They weren’t cutting research funding across the board.

Ruth, as we heard from Joan Brugge at the top of this episode, huge cuts in federal support have already been impacting research labs across the United States, including labs that don’t have anything to do with politics. Can you think of an example, prior to this administration, of a very advanced society with very advanced scientific institutes, simply threatening to cut off funding?

Ben-Ghiat: The only example I can think of is China, during Mao.

Applebaum: I was just gonna ask about that.

Ben-Ghiat: During Mao’s long-tenured Cultural Revolution, et cetera, science was put back by generations. Scientists were among the intellectuals and researchers who were killed and imprisoned and purged.

And so you had some of this winnowing-out because of loyalty. You had ideological obedience to the party and to the revolution over fact-based knowledge, and fact-based research became the enemy. Universities were destroyed. Experts were sent to the countryside for reeducation.

So really, people who have studied this talk about an entire lost generation of scientists, and engineers as well. And instead, you had institutions, including scientific ones populated with guards and people who were inexperienced, fanatics, reckless. And so even people who were heroes of the nation, they were beaten, tortured, taken for reeducation. It didn’t matter who they were and what kind of contribution they could make. The entire enterprise of science had to be wrecked. That’s the only example I can think of where you have an intention, an intensity. And, of course, the scope was bigger, but this is just beginning in the United States, and it’s really, really frightening.

Applebaum: Why do you think Harvard has been such a focus? What is it about that institution that has attracted the attention not really just of Trump but of the Project 2025 crowd.

Ben-Ghiat: Well here we get into the logic of authoritarian bullying. The more powerful an entity is, the more they must be made an example of. And the higher, more prestigious your target, the more bringing them down, or trying to, sends a message to everybody else.

And so that’s how authoritarian shifts in culture—and I’m talking about culture as turns of behavior, values—that’s how they can be jump-started, because then universities with far smaller endowments and power and clout would say, Oh, if Harvard’s capitulating, well, what can we do?

Applebaum: Yeah, when I saw the attack on Harvard, I also thought: They’re doing this to show that they can do anything. If they can destroy Harvard, they can destroy anyone.

Applebaum: There are quite a lot of people out there who like some of what Trump is doing, and maybe they’re worried by some pieces of it, but they wouldn’t see this as some kind of deliberate destruction. What would you say to them, to convince them of your point of view?

Ben-Ghiat: I think that it’s a question of time. When you take away pandemic planning, when you take away scientific research, when you take away accessibility for vaccines, the results aren’t seen immediately.

It takes time for these things to develop. And so, unfortunately, I believe we’re going to have a reckoning, that eyes will open as things fall apart in America. And then people who did not want to believe who Trump was will see the light.

Applebaum: The erosion of these institutions, the attempt to undermine our faith in the scientific method—these things could be part of a larger autocratic effort to maintain power.

Ben-Ghiat: Why is he militarizing everyday life? He wants to build fear in people about going to vote. There’s both a work of discrediting elections and a work of intimidation that’s going to intensify as the midterms grow closer.

Applebaum: Let’s talk a little bit about cultural institutions. Why would an American president be interested in dictating the content of exhibitions at the Smithsonian, a beloved American institution. It belongs to all of us. Its governing board has all kinds of worthy people on it: the chief justice of the Supreme Court; it’s usually had the vice president; many other important figures in public life—bipartisan, I should say. What is it about the Smithsonian that’s attracting his interest or, again, the interest of the people around him?

Ben-Ghiat: Autocrats engage in a mix of utopia and nostalgia, so the Smithsonian is a perfect target if you truly are aiming big. And authoritarians like Trump, they think big; they think long-term. They’re very obsessed with their legacy.

You purge the content of histories that you no longer want, or people you no longer want featured—and instead, you promote your own sanitized, mythological version of history. It’s not enough to just fire people you are smearing who are “radical left,” even though they’re not. You have to go after the whole thing.

Applebaum: For people listening for whom this is a new idea: Why would a leader be trying to reshape or rewrite history? How does it serve the president to erase Black history, or to eliminate stories of the immigrants who have come from all over the world? What does that do for him?

Ben-Ghiat: So every leader, especially authoritarians, want to situate themselves within the flow of the nation. And they need to show that they are on the right side of history. History itself has to be rewritten. And in this case, we have white-Christian-nationalist history, which in a totalitarian framework does not permit the coexistence with other histories. You can’t read the history of institutionalized racism or slavery. And so the entire history, and this translates down to what’s been banned first in Florida and Oklahoma and other states. All of this has to go. And cultural and political icons—people who might be enshrined in the Smithsonian—have to go. At stake is rewriting the entire history of America as a multiracial, multifaith democracy.

Applebaum: The administration has also halted some federal-government cultural spending—for example, on small museums or monuments, and indeed scholars—and redirected it instead to the upcoming 250th-anniversary celebrations of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Why do you think the Trump administration cares about that anniversary, and what distinguishes that from teaching civics or the history of the American Revolution?

Ben-Ghiat: Well, Trump in particular is a man of spectacle. He knows how to stage a spectacle, and ideally, of course, he is at the center of this.

This is a classic appropriation of what would be a very important national milestone. It will become an excuse to intensify a kind of rewriting of American history, but also remapping of the way that Washington, D.C., looks as the power center. And he’s already done this with the White House. That’s leaving his mark. So it’s never just a superficial transformation when you have authoritarians. They can change countries so that even in the space of just a decade, it can take generations for that country to recover.

Applebaum: Ruth, we know how this worked in the past. Dictators have built monumental palaces, or reconstructed their capital cities, as a way of proving they can defeat death, make their power last forever. Famously, Stalin built skyscrapers in Moscow, as well as in Riga and Warsaw, after he occupied those cities, too.

Ben-Ghiat: Yeah, I agree. What autocrats really want is to feel safe, because they of all people know how hated they are. They know who their enemies are, and the depth of hatred that they foster with their violence and their corruption. And so they build these safe spaces for themselves, both at the level of governance where they have these, they’re called inner sanctums, with sycophants and family members.

And they also put their mark on the capital. I think, in America, because we haven’t had a national dictatorship, it’s hard to envision that autocrats truly don’t care about public welfare. They have totally different priorities.

Applebaum: How does that make sense even from the point of view of the authoritarian? I mean, if they continue to strive to damage America, how long can their destruction continue before it reflects the failure of the leader himself?

Ben-Ghiat: That’s a risk they take. But one thing about authoritarians is—although, as I’ve just described, they’re very fearful—they also come to believe in their own omnipotence. In part, because, all day long, if they’ve done their job and gotten enough sycophants around them—we’ve seen this daily in America—all day long,they’re having praise from people. Without you, we wouldn’t be anything, Mr. President. And after a while of this, and we’ve seen this, they start to believe their own propaganda. And then they take risks, and they exceed; they overreach. And that often is their downfall.

Applebaum: Ruth, finally, how does this change the conversation about the midterms in 2026? Is the rewriting of history or attacks on universities—are these part of an attempt to persuade Americans to think differently about elections? Do you connect these attacks on science, on medicine, on culture to the midterms?

Ben-Ghiat: There’s been a concerted and very relentless attempt to change the way that Americans feel about authorities, to change the way that they feel about American institutions. And elections are the most important of those institutions because it is the way that we express our voice and have our agency in the world.

And so, already, as we well know, with his election denial in 2020, he had managed—he actually pulled off a historic feat—he managed to convince tens of millions of people of a very easily verifiable fact that he lost the election. Instead, he convinced tens of millions that he was the rightful winner. And he kept up the distrust in elections all these years. The churches allied with him; the manosphere; all of his enablers and allies. They’ve done a beautiful job from the autocratic point of view of discrediting not only elections but the whole way you think about democracy. So that’s part of it.

The other is: Why is he militarizing everyday life? He wants to build fear in people about going to vote. There’s both a work of discrediting elections and a work of intimidation that’s going to intensify as the midterms grow closer.

Applebaum: So part of the point of attacking institutions that collect and promote knowledge, whether scientific or cultural, is just to reduce Americans’ trust in everything. If we don’t know what’s true and what’s not true, then when Trump argues that the results of the 2020 election are fake, we believe him. There isn’t any evidence, but we don’t care about evidence. And they might also persuade Americans not to accept the results of elections this year either, if they aren’t favorable to the Republicans.

Ben-Ghiat: Yes.And it’s so nice to speak with you because you’ve studied these things too. That’s a big point. It’s destroying trust, which is really trust in each other, too, because what is an election? It’s everybody casting their vote, their preference, and then based on that collective will, you can change a leadership.

And so by convincing people that, Oh, it’s just all gonna be rigged, you’re really giving up on each other. And when you don’t vote, you’re also kind of giving up on your own voice.

Ben-Ghiat: Ultimately, destroying trust is the currency of autocrats, and it’s one of the saddest things. And we know, when autocracies finally fall, rebuilding that trust is one of the most difficult things to do.

Applebaum: Thank you very much, Ruth Ben-Ghiat.

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

At a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Donald Trump told the crowd that his upcoming speech at the World Economic Forum would tackle one of his core issues: affordability. But the address he delivered in Davos yesterday was not quite what he’d telegraphed.

In what my colleague David A. Graham described as a “stump speech,” the president strayed from that focus, roaming from Arctic defense to the Minnesota fraud scandal to the policies of “Sleepy” Joe Biden. When he returned to the topic of affordability, he claimed that grocery prices are “going down” (they’re not) and that drug prices have declined by “2,000 percent” (they haven’t). Although Trump campaigned on the economy, weak polling has recently spurred new plans to make life in America more affordable.

At one point, Trump plugged a plan to curb predatory lending practices by capping credit-card interest rates at 10 percent—but the deadline (proposed on Truth Social) for the policy to go into effect had passed the day before. Trump also used his speech to promote his plan to lower housing costs, which he recently unveiled in an executive order. The policy is aimed at preventing corporations from buying up single-family homes, and has bipartisan support. These proposals were a blip in his 80-minute speech before he quickly pivoted.

Trump has lately been laser-focused on foreign policy. Nearly three weeks ago, U.S. troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and brought him to New York for trial. Since then, Trump has flirted with military action in Iran and attempted to bully Denmark into giving up Greenland, threatening a sweeping new tariff strategy that—had Trump not reneged yesterday—could have raised costs for Americans.

When Trump and his officials have talked about the economy, their comments have been confusing. The White House’s insistence that consumer goods are, in fact, affordable has so far not connected with many Americans, for whom high prices are still top of mind. In an attempt to underscore how cheap supermarkets have supposedly become, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said last week that “it can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, you know, a corn tortilla, and one other thing.” After being criticized online for appearing out of touch, she clarified that $15.64 was the more accurate figure, based on “almost 1,000 simulations,” for “three full square meals and a snack.” (I have some follow-up questions: What’s that “other thing”? And what constitutes a “square” meal?)

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also faced blowback from observers and Democratic politicians this week after suggesting in an interview that “mom and pop” homebuyers are snapping up “five, 10, 12 homes” for retirement. And at a rally in Ohio earlier today, Vice President Vance compared the American economy to a doomed enterprise: “You don’t turn the Titanic around overnight,” he said. Trump has blamed “bad public-relations people” for failing to sell his affordability message—but the problem could also have to do with these sorts of gaffes.

The president’s inconsistent messaging may play a role too. Before the holidays, he held a rally in Pennsylvania as part of his “affordability tour”—an effort to shift Americans’ perspectives on the economy. His address included a digression about why the Democrats’ emphasis on affordability was a “hoax,” how Representative Ilhan Omar “does nothing but bitch,” and why Americans don’t need so many pencils. His speech at the Detroit Economic Club included a few diversions but was overall more targeted. “The Trump economic boom has officially begun,” he said.

Trump is right that the economy is showing signs of health. Unemployment is low, and the stock market is on a tear. But these metrics don’t reveal the whole picture. The economy is adding fewer jobs even as inflation remains under control. The Atlantic contributing writer John Dickerson recently pointed out that “aggregate gains mask uneven distribution, and many workers really are seeing their purchasing power erode.” If Trump’s attempts to interfere with the Federal Reserve’s independence prove successful, they could unleash even more economic uncertainty. “Trump is hardly the first president to cherry-pick numbers and accentuate the positive,” Dickerson wrote. “But his argument is weak because he has to overcome people’s lived experience.”

Despite his constant jabs at his predecessor, Trump is in some sense following in Biden’s footsteps. “Bidenomics” fell flat as a slogan in part because Biden’s rosy view of the economy didn’t connect with voters facing ever-higher inflation. When Trump and his team aren’t shutting down criticism of the economy, they’re simply distracted. Neither communicates to Americans that their struggles are understood.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

There’s a double helix in my local Sephora. It’s roughly the size and shape of a soda can, and it is accompanied by a placard referencing patents and peptides, as if in a science fair. It’s trying to sell me a hair mask.

Online, the company responsible for this display describes itself as a “biology-first haircare brand, powered by biotech.” It practices “biomimetic hairscience,” and, thanks to “a decade of complex research into the bioscience of hair,” has patented a peptide that repairs hair “at a molecular level across multiple types of bonds including polypeptide chains and disulfide bonds.” I have no idea what any of this means. The mask costs $75.

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

            <h2>What the Greenland Crisis Teaches Europe About Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/greenland-crisis-trump-diplomacy-nato/685715/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump announced that he had “formed the framework of a future deal” with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, raising hopes in Europe that the Greenland crisis may have reached an end. The framework reportedly respects Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland and focuses instead on beefing up America’s military presence in the territory, reaching a deal on crucial minerals, and increasing cooperation on both Arctic security and Trump’s Golden Dome missile-defense system.

The worst of the crisis may have passed, at least for now. But the past few days underscore the extraordinary stakes of a debate among Europe’s leaders that remains unresolved. Should they take a conciliatory approach toward Trump, in the hope of coaxing him to their side? Or should they stand firm when he threatens them, imposing costs on him even if it means risking their relationship with his administration?

The lesson that Europe is likely to draw from the past year—and particularly from the Greenland fiasco—is that it must do both. It needs Trump whisperers who will flatter him, but it also needs to pack its velvet gloves with steel. If Europe’s leaders only praise him, Trump is likely to ignore them when convenient, rip up any deals they have made, and take whatever he can when the opportunity arises. If they show only toughness, they risk prompting him to withdraw from NATO or rupture the transatlantic alliance in other ways.

Vivian Salama: Trump wants to be the new Polk

The past week helps demonstrate these dynamics. Just a few days ago, Trump refused to rule out the use of force in taking Greenland, and he promised to impose tariffs on eight countries that recently sent troops to the territory for a security mission, even though the deployment had been fully coordinated with the U.S. military. Then, in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday morning, Trump lambasted Europe: “If it wasn’t for us, you’d all be speaking German and a little bit of Japanese perhaps.” He reiterated his argument that “no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.” “That’s our territory,” he claimed. But he disavowed the use of force, saying instead that he wanted to acquire Greenland through “immediate negotiations.”

This was seen as a major concession, but it prompted further questions. What happens when Denmark refuses to transfer ownership? Will force be back on the table? Senator Lindsey Graham, who had been meeting with European officials in Davos, stoked further anxiety with a social-media post soon after Trump’s speech, in which he demanded that Denmark give the United States the legal title to Greenland.

Just an hour after his speech, however, Trump rescinded his tariff threat and announced that the aforementioned framework had been reached. The New York Times reported that European officials had discussed granting America sovereignty over Greenland’s U.S. military bases. But a European official with direct knowledge of the negotiations—and who was not authorized to speak publicly—told me this was not part of the deal.

If the framework sticks, it will be a triumph of Danish diplomacy. For the past year, Copenhagen has offered to work with the Trump administration on all of its policy demands. But it imposed two red lines and never wavered: The Danes wouldn’t compromise on territorial integrity or Greenland’s right to self-determination. Otherwise, though, the president had wide latitude to get what he wanted.

Many other European leaders, by contrast, have responded to Trump’s repeated bullying over the past year with nearly unconditional accommodation and praise, while working behind the scenes to moderate his policies. They agreed to his demands to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of their GDP. Their response to his tariffs last year was minimal. Rutte, the NATO leader, even called Trump Europe’s “daddy.”

This soft approach is easy to ridicule, but the Europeans have been able to point to some successes since deploying it. Trump stopped talking about leaving NATO. He agreed to sell weapons to Ukraine and provide intelligence support. And the approach prepared the way for yesterday’s announcement that Rutte himself had been the one to broker the deal with Trump that defused the crisis.

The framework appears to respect Copenhagen’s red lines, which raises the question: Why did Trump suggest he would finally agree to it? After all, it was on offer for most of the past year.

The main answer is that Denmark made clear that it was not going to back down in negotiations, leaving Trump with few options. If he had used force in Greenland, he could find himself in a war with one of America’s closest allies. Such a war would be clearly illegal under U.S. law, and it could trigger a civil-military crisis, presenting military officers with plainly unlawful orders.

Other European countries also played a key role in increasing the potential costs of Trump’s aggression. The European Union agreed to impose $93 billion tariffs on the U.S. if the ones Trump had threatened actually took effect. And some leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, suggested using the Anti-Coercion Instrument, also known as the European “bazooka,” which allows for a unified trade-policy response to coercive behavior like Trump’s. The Europeans were divided on invoking the instrument; some worried that Trump might escalate and pull out of NATO altogether. But their serious discussion of it suggested to the president that he might run a genuine risk.

And then there were the financial markets. According to Treasury Department data, EU members and NATO allies hold more than $3.31 trillion in U.S. debt—more than triple what China holds. On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond reached its highest level since August, sparking concern that investors would sell off U.S. Treasuries if Trump escalated the conflict.

Moreover, the prospect of controlling Greenland is deeply unpopular among Americans. One poll conducted earlier this month found that 75 percent of them oppose any attempt to take over the territory. And more than a dozen Republican senators made public statements warning against it.

The Greenland crisis was in many ways the sum of Europeans’ fears about Trump, raising the specter of an attack on a NATO ally and the dissolution of the alliance. For the moment, the crisis seems to have been averted. But Trump is too fickle a negotiator for Europe to take comfort in yesterday’s announcement. To keep him from reescalating or threatening them on other issues in the future, they may well follow some advice from an unlikely source: J. D. Vance.

“I think a lot of European nations were right about our invasion of Iraq,” Vance said last year. “Frankly, if the Europeans had been a little more independent, and a little more willing to stand up, then maybe we could have saved the entire world from the strategic disaster that was the American-led invasion of Iraq.” Vance continued, “I don’t want the Europeans to just do whatever the Americans tell them to do. I don’t think it’s in their interest, and I don’t think it’s in our interests, either.”</div>

Scientist wanted to know something and decided to perform an experiment and observe the results. He got his results. The experiment was a resounding success.

That he didn&#39;t actually like the results or that he wants to whine about it now, doesn&#39;t really matter in the least.

Indeed. Come to think of, they did run a safety test on Chernobyl Block 4, with equally nice and clear test results.

Idiots with no clue how thigs work are really everywhere and they only learn if things go spectacularly wrong. Sometimes not even then.

On the plus-side, while this person completely failed the IT aspects, he at least did the right thing to publish this so at least some others get a warning.

well, I hope you don&#39;t take part in Design meetings ;-)

&quot;Never lose your users&#39; data&quot; is kinda Rule #1.

And trivially easy for the ChatGPT software to avoid that happening here.

Subject is just the joke I&#39;m looking for in yet another story of the EVIL formerly known as Google.

That&#39;s some grade A gaslighting there. If the scientist was given reasonable indication of the intended action rather than the modern version software gives &quot;Something will disappear, yes/no?&quot; there&#39;s reasonable grounds to assume that he wouldn&#39;t have proceeded with the experiment.

Stop excusing shitty fucking modern software that is opaque to the user to the point of being actively harmful. That goes with Windows &quot;Something went wrong.&quot; error messages.

100%, and I can hear all the comments about backups stampeding towards us. But this is even more straightforward than general backups. If you&#39;re going to pull a switch that you know may be risky and you&#39;re doing it to find out what happens, at least do a quick &quot;cp -a existing_dir new_dir&quot; first! Or take a filesystem or VM snapshot first.

This story could easily have been, &quot;When Two Years of Academic Work Vanished With a Single Drive Failure&quot;.

If you only have one backup, it was likely not important either.

Just ask the AI to hallucinate 2 years worth of research based on the *anonymous* training corpus you&#39;ve been feeding the model.

If it&#39;s important, have multiple backups.

Surprise!  It did what they told it to do.

Put important data in a cloud platform, i.e. someone else&#39;s computer.  Then just decide on a whim to tell the platform it can&#39;t store or access your data anymore.  Don&#39;t bother making copies of anything before clicking...

If turning off the &quot;data consent&quot; option deletes everything without confirmation, that&#39;s maybe mediocre UI design, but not completely unexpected.

Actually it very much is unexpected. Removing historical output on a setting change isn&#39;t obvious. Most software does *not* behave that way. Something this dangerous should not be behind a single prompt.

It actually saddens me to see so many Slashdotters here not criticise OpenAI for this. I thought this site had the *good* programmers, but the way you&#39;re all acting I wonder if you secretly moonlight for Microsoft&#39;s UX design team.

C&#39;mon! That&#39;s your work and you&#39;ve never done a backup in two years? C&#39;mon!

To be *fair*, a lot of the providers have been going out of their way to make it difficult to extract data in a manner amenable to backups.

Making the data both available for their own services and catering to bacup/restore concerns is against their business interest.

When working with AI, the first thing to always do is commit everything to git, then make a branch and see what AI can do. Once it&#39;s done, merge it back in.  While the concept of diffs don&#39;t make as much sense when it comes to spreadsheets and documents[1], git is still a decent framework for managing projects with them in it.  If you use LibreOffice you can store in &quot;flat&quot; versions of the formats (such as .fodt) which are single-file, uncompressed xml files. But the diff won&#39;t be very readable to humans.

[1] I&#39;ve long thought git should be able to better deal natively with modern document formats that are really just xml inside of zip files.  Although a diff of an XML file is probably not too useful for humans.  Still, it would be nice if the parts of the document that didn&#39;t change (style sheet etc) would be stored in a way to avoid duplication.   Can anyone point me at resources to do this better?  Surely there&#39;s a git-based utility out there to make this happen.

There&#39;s nothing like posting to slashdot to get one to do some research after posting!

There&#39;s a utility called ReZipDoc  [github.com] to assist in using git with OpenDocument formats.  By converting the file to an uncompressed zip file, git can deduplicate the parts of the file that didn&#39;t change, even though they are still inside the zip file.  And it sets up git to give you a plain-text diff for human consumption.  Pretty slick.  And on a modern filesystem like ZFS, BtrFS, or BCacheFS, you get get compression at the fi

This is a complete data-management failure on low amateur level. Routinely happens to people thinking they do not need IT experts because it &quot;is all easy&quot;. Zero compassion from me, this amateur did it to himself.

In theory you&#39;re right, but in practice I doubt that they gave the AI a thousand tries. And your optimization approach would need a few orders of magnitude more. If you have an AI that can do self play it will find all kinds of exploits as shortcuts, but it also needs like a million tries for that.

but in practice I doubt that they gave the AI a thousand tries.Why? Gaming benchmarks and lying abut performance is pervasive in the LLM industry.

Reading through some of Don Knuth&#39;s stuff, I&#39;d say he has a pretty good chance of beating the pants of Claude in this one.

Then their business vanishes and we get the next AI Winter. Which will happen anyways. They should never have started lying, but these people have now done the same crap for maybe 10 AI hypes now. I think part of them are simply scammers and part are not capable of learning.

Anyone familiar with AI is painfully aware that AI models are ONLY good at what they&#39;re trained to do.  If you train it to pass your interview, then of course it&#39;s going to be very good at that.  But as soon as you take a step or two away from what it&#39;s been training on, it will be anywhere from bad to horrible.  And what&#39;s worse, they often have an absurdly high level of confidence in their wrong answers when you go off training.

Either they are really stupid in their benchmarks, or they did not train on the test set.

Obviously. But it makes for a nice lie-by-misdirection headline for the clueless.

The point of hiring is not to hire people who know the answers to riddles under a time limit.  The point is to hire people who can get up to speed on the job reasonably quickly, work well in concert with their co-workers, and then grow the position and product and company going forward.  Honestly, the best candidates for most tech jobs won&#39;t be bothered to optimize for your particular interview - I&#39;m not saying they&#39;ll outright fail, but rather they have many opportunities, so for them the interview is a mutual affair.  They are also interviewing you, and if you interview them in your asshat persona, they will likely just move on.

The latest version of Gemini is causing quite a stir in our engineering school.  We&#39;ve been testing it by snapping images of problems from exams on cell phones and asking Gemini to solve them.  The worst exam performance we&#39;ve seen so far is an overall grade of B-, and that includes graduate-level exams.  Gemini even helpfully provides all of its intermediate work to show how it got the solution.

Gemini can even (correctly) find a solution for many simple design problems.  We&#39;re scrambling to adapt to what&#39;s

At this point is Apple being honest, or is it just creating a narrative it knows the current US administration can use to make US-Euro relations even worse, knowing Europe doesn&#39;t want that?

Regardless though, it shouldn&#39;t have taken government action to get Apple to a position where it doesn&#39;t act as a gatekeeper for how people are allowed to use the devices they bought and own.

At this point is Apple being honest, or is it just creating a narrative it knows the current US administration can use to make US-Euro relations even worse, knowing Europe doesn&#39;t want that?The EU probably does want worse relations with the US... the narative that &quot;The US is steamrolling all you helpless tiny European countries&quot; bolsters the EU&#39;s power even further. Honestly, it&#39;s all heading towards authoritarianism at this point; dark times.

Right, because Apple strongly (and programmatically) encourages people NEVER to use anything but their monopoly products. If you even TRY to install a 3rd party app store, the phone will put up a large warning screen claiming how terribly bad this choice would be for the user, their phone, and (probably) their family and pets. Android does as well, but it&#39;s a lot smaller and easier to bypass. Install the free Android dev tools and you can install anything you can find.

The EU commission ordered Apple to drop the $0.59 charge.

Apple responded: OK but can we charge this instead?

The EU is fining Apple for not following the order, to drop the charge. And, by the way, the EU commission hasn&#39;t answered the question.

Apple is saying that it&#39;s not their fault for not dropping it because the EU won&#39;t answer their question.

If this is the case, then Apple doesn&#39;t have a leg to stand on. The crazy girlfriend gambit ain&#39;t gonna work in an EU court.

It&#39;s a common scheme for a big &quot;investment group&quot; to buy up companies with a decent reputation, start shoving ads, snoopware, and/or junk fees on it, giving them short-term profits, and then sell it off at a discount when its now damaged reputation makes it a money-loser.

Even though they sell it at less than they bought it for, the reputation milking between those events often brings in more than enough to cover company sell losses. Or they just may keep it and let it linger until the skinny over-milked cow

By their behaviour I&#39;m guessing Bending Spoons is one of those blood-sucking private equity firms.

When a company is in decline you can either wait until the company is completely broke and it can&#39;t misses payroll (or misses payments on its loans), or it can hit the big red button and get bought out by a company like Broadcom or Bending Spoons that cuts costs and sucks the marrow from the bones. While it sucks for the company to die like that, it&#39;s better than the alternative and nobody should have been caught off-guard. Unless you were specifically paid a retention bonus to see the transaction through,

Hey, maybe they&#39;ve perfected the service, and don&#39;t need any workers to improve or maintain it anymore!

Or maybe this is the beginning of the end, and they&#39;re officially spiraling in toward the drain now.

It&#39;s the second one.  It&#39;s just a matter of how much ruination is left in them before the bare husk of their name is sold off to, oh, let&#39;s say, IBM.

Not sure who you mean by &quot;they&quot;, not sure you do either.

It&#39;s too bad that this has to happen. It was nice having a Video platform that allowed viewers to watch videos and didn&#39;t abuse it&#39;s viewers like YouTube does.

The good news is that video platforms are a solved problem. It should not be too hard for a competitor to launch a viable replacement. The only &quot;problem&quot; is the lost mindshare. It will take a while, or a lot of advertising cash, for a good replacement to benefit form the social networking effect.

Personally I think your comment wins the discussion.

Actually reminds me of teaching basic English debate to Japanese students. Most years I used a debate proposition about smoking cigarettes and killing people off was one of the stronger affirmative arguments that got used pretty often.

Currently reading  T. Rex and the Crater of Doom  and it has me thinking about extinction events again. The book is about a large one provoked by a major disaster, and I actually don&#39;t believe we humans yet have that capability, even with all of our nuclear bombs. However I th

We have 8 billion+ people on the planet. We can afford to lose a billion or so and not affect our ability to advance science.  Having fewer people would definitely enhance wellbeing as there would be less pollution which means cleaner air and water.  Less trash would be produced as well.

Clearly we had no problem with scientific advancements when our population was lower. With what we have now, why would you think fewer people would change that?

Our real problem is longer life spans and people living longer, much longer after they have retired.  In the meantime, birthrates worldwide are imploding, not just in the West, but even in the most populous ones - China, India,....  At this rate, there won&#39;t be enough people for the workforce (which may not be a problem if AI succeeds in filling any gaps in the workload), but there will be more retirees than ever

Maybe we can wait for humanity to go extinct, and then &quot;watch&quot; what happens to the world in te

This comment for the win. It&#39;s important to remember that a hell of a lot of amazing advances were made in the 20th century when the population started out at about 1.75 billion in 1900 and ended at about 6 billion in 2000. I really doubt there&#39;s an advantage to having 8 billion instead of 6, or even 4 - it doesn&#39;t drive markets or innovation any faster, except that perhaps people are suffering *more* due to malnutrition and inability to access medical services; but those calamities don&#39;t appear to be drivi

While we are not heading for some population bomb doomsday scenario, even at current population levels and resource utilization rates, we are headed for a cliff sometime in the next couple of hundred of years, if not sooner.  Much of our farming relies on aquifers that are being drained faster than they are naturally replenished, and fertilizer that uses phosphorus dug up from mines.  Both of these resources are used one and then are basically flushed into the ocean, with very little effort made towards rec

Maybe the rest of the world can step up. Big opportunity to replace the US now. China is a big contributor, maybe they will. The EU should.

It&#39;s unfortunate for Americans that didn&#39;t vote for this nonsense have to live through the experience of knowing our country is now a villain on the world stage. There have always been things to be ashamed of, but until now it&#39;s always been easy to at least convince yourself the US does more good than bad. That is unfortunately the past now.

Speak for yourself, I remember a recent democrat president saying &quot;If you like your health care plan, you&#39;ll be able to keep your health care plan, period&quot;;    This turned out to be false, didn&#39;t it?

It is very difficult for an honest person to foresee the level to which dishonest people will stoop to.  That democrat president was guilty of wishful thinking and that&#39;s about all.

This. Obama said if you like your health-care plan, you can keep it. He couldn&#39;t promise that the health insurance companies would keep it.

Also it would be easy for Obama to make the assumption that people wouldn&#39;t vote against ACA if they wanted it.  His words could be read to mean if they want it, they can keep voting for it and then they would keep it.  It never ceases to amaze me how Americans vote for people who are clearly against their interests.  No one could have predicted that they would have allowed in someone so bad for them.  Because up until now people believed in Democracy.

&quot;our country is now a villain on the world stage&quot;.  Only now.  Yeah... riiiiight.

That&#39;s a rash assumption.  I presume that you think that European, Asian, Oceanic, and African governments aren&#39;t going to make up the monetary and intellectual deficits left by the USA&#39;s withdrawal?

MAGAs&#39; reasoning is often that because subject matter experts are sometimes wrong, their special Jesus-induced gut-feelings are more accurate. But such SJIGF&#39;s have proven even worse than experts in the past. (It was called &quot;alchemy&quot; and &quot;snake-oil&quot;.)

&quot;But those in the past were the wrong sect&quot; or whatnot is given as an excuse. Whether that&#39;s true or not, the current group of SJIGF&#39;s needs to demonstrate their accuracy over a reasonable time before we allow them to override experts. &quot;Just trust us because we

You mean the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. [unroca.org] It&#39;s not a gun registry in the sense I think you&#39;re trying to imply. It&#39;s a database that&#39;s intended to track transfers of military arms (tanks, aircraft, ships, etc.) between countries.

I don&#39;t see the USA withdrawing from either as a Good Thing (TM).

What a screwball point of view to call out Canada as antagonizing the US, when the US started a trade war with Canada and has gone so far as to actually threaten annexation. And you think Canada doesn&#39;t spend money on its military? It has a massive military for a country of its population size, and has an equally massive reputation both for its peacekeeping and participation in major wars. Canada has been the U.S.&#39;s best trading partner since WWII. &quot;Subsidizing&quot; is a bullshit term for trade deficits. The U.

It has a massive military for a country of its population size, and has an equally massive reputation both for its peacekeeping and participation in major warsThat was decades ago.

Canada is doubling its military spending this year, up to over $60B, at 2% of GDP. I don&#39;t know what goalposts you need to keep moving to get from &quot;not having to spend any money on military&quot; to &quot;next to nothing on military&quot; to eventually get to those numbers, but good luck with that.

So much there in that short paragraph.  Saying Canada shouldn&#39;t antagonize Trump is fine, but the problem is there&#39;s *nothing* we can do that *won&#39;t* antagonize him and nothing we can do to placate him, short of inviting him to come be a king.  What can Greenland do to not antagonize him (what can Ukraine do to not antagonize Putin)?  See the problem?

The last trade agreement trump himself signed granted quite a bit of access to the Canadian dairy market up to a certain cap, which has never been reached, so those high diary tariffs have never been levied. Trump is lying about them. But even further, if Canada opened up the the entire dairy market, while it would destroy the entire Canadian dairy industry in one fell swoop it would hardly register as a blip on the scope for the fortunes of American dairy.  A lot of American companies don&#39;t realize how small the Canadian market is compared to the entire US market. Canada is littered with the corpses of US companies who tried to enter completely unprotected markets.  Lowes and Target to name two.  Besides that, to eliminate the trade imbalance Canadians would have to buy 10 times the number of US products.  How many cars does Trump want us to buy? 10 per person?

As far as tariffs go, you want the US to reduce its &quot;subsidization&quot; of Canada by... taxing Americans?  It&#39;s absolutely bonkers to me how GOP voters are so excited about some of the biggest tax raises the US has had in decades.  Yes tariffs hurt Canada and drag our economy down. Congrats on that. But they are a tax on US citizens!

As far as broken relationships go, so many of my friends and relatives in the US think that things will go back to normal after Trump&#39;s done in three years.  But I just don&#39;t see any possible way that&#39;s going to happen.

Canada is also very protectionist of its domestic industries, diary, eggs, meat, lumber, etc. are all highly regulated in Canada in a way to prevent US from entering these markets.If this is true then you have to admit one of Trumps signature policies, one of the few he actually got passed and spent like 1/2 of his first term was a complete failure.  What was the point of spending all that effort to re-negotiate NAFTA just to end up complaining about the same shit 5 years later? All of this shit was already negotiated by Trump himself so why is it a problem now?  United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement [wikipedia.org]

Eventually there will be a sane person leading USA again, unfortunately a lot of time of that term will be needed just to reverse all the current stupidity..As far as the rest of NATO is concerned, especially the UK following Trumps unbelievable insult about our troops in Afghanistan where he said we weren&#39;t near the front line, you&#39;re going to be way longer than one term or even one consecutively twice elected President before those bridges Trump has dynamited get rebuilt. Trump with that one flippant remark in his Fox News interview has managed to piss off pretty much all of the public in the UK, a nation that doesn&#39;t fetishize it&#39;s military like the US does. The Liberal Democrat Party President Josh Babarinde MP even posted on X &quot;Trump can go fuck himself.&quot; The UK public is rapidly turning away from the US and all things US.

The US has never been healthier than during this presidency. It is amazing how good the presidency is. He deserves Nobel Prize in Medicine for that.If anything happens there is 3 level ironclad disease protection:

1. sue anyone complaining about it2. threaten countries with diseases with tariffs3. blame Biden for everything

And don&#39;t forget, he single handedly stopped autism a few months ago. Two Nobel prizes in medicine then.

And yes, that was sarcasm. Poe&#39;s law is very true.

It&#39;s the circuses without the breadI&#39;d say it&#39;s an all-inbred circus.

What&#39;s this about Trump saying NATO didn&#39;t help USA in Afghanistan after 9/11 I hear?

You know how you know he&#39;s lying, his pie hole is yapping or his little fingers are typing.

Primary objective is Israel&#39;s propaganda comes first.  Anything else conservative is just bonus.

So all they have to do is ban TP Link and America will be safe!

Did you know that deliberately conflating criticism of a country with religious bigotry lends you no credibility? But you&#39;re posting as AC so maybe you&#39;re aware of that. After all, only a couple decades ago, Israel was posturing as a land of three religions, and the equation of it with Judaism alone was considered anti-semitic.

First off, the Trump administration was not the primary mover for the Tiktok ban, the democrats were. The bill was dead in the water until after Oct. 7th, when they breathed new life

            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

Over the past few weeks, previously unthinkable horrors have unfolded in Minnesota as federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement have shot Renee Nicole Good in the head, killing her, and arrested a 5-year-old boy just as he was arriving home from school. Erin Maye Quade is a Minnesota state senator who has now witnessed countless instances of federal agents arresting and detaining her constituents. This week, Maye Quade decided it was time to put out a blunt warning for the rest of America in the form of a TikTok video: “There may be people outside of Minnesota who are thinking: When this comes to my state, I’m white, or a U.S. citizen, or I live in a suburb or rural area, or a neighborhood with few or no immigrants, and this is something I won’t experience or see,” the senator said. “I’m here to dispel that myth for you. That is not the case.”

Maye Quade, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Apple Valley, emphasized just how ubiquitous immigration enforcement has become across rural, suburban, and urban Minnesota. ICE presence is so large it surpasses the number of local law enforcement members in the state’s 10 largest metro areas combined. These agents are not working from an organized list of known immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully, let alone a judicial warrant; instead they are operating at random. Maye Quade says she’s observed agents just driving around her town “looking for kidnappings of opportunity,” which she described as agents idling their cars and simply waiting for Black, brown, or Asian Americans to walk by, as they take out the trash, walk their dog, or run into a gas station. “They will swarm that person, kidnap them, and take them away.”

Maye Quade realized she should use what she has witnessed to warn her colleagues in other states, along with friends and family who don’t live in Minnesota. Her video has garnered more than 3 million views. “It sounds like a wartime diary,” Maye Quade said in an interview with Slate, but it wasn’t only that the senator gave a no-frills, boots-on-the-ground perspective that drew so much attention to her video. It was the fact that she simultaneously was offering advice on how to deal with federal immigration agents when they come to your town.

Two days after Maye Quade posted her TikTok, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, the latest state to face an onslaught of federal agents. I asked Maye Quade what advice she would give residents there and across the country as they begin to deal with federal immigration agents.

“The first thing is to either put together your constitutional observer training now, or reach out to folks in Minnesota to get that training.”

That’s a reference to the Handbook for Constitutional Observers, a project by the advocacy groups Immigrant Defense Network and COPAL. It was created in response to Donald Trump’s second term in office and offers guidelines on how to legally observe and document law enforcement interactions and inform people about their civil rights and due process. Francisco Segovia, executive director of COPAL, explained that this training is specifically designed for folks who are not directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, but who can still participate in helping educate people about their constitutional rights.

In Minnesota, Maye Quade explained that communities organized themselves by zones or regions, and established Signal chats to communicate about federal immigration activity. Participants were each assigned a role; some were in charge of vetting people who want to join the group, while others were assigned to commute around the community and report on any immigration enforcement activity. Local mutual aid networks were also stood up to ensure those impacted by federal agents’ immigration enforcement actions had food, medicine, rides to work and school, and safety patrols around them.

“DOPA forms—delegation of parental authority.”

This is a document that gives someone authority to take care of a child when their parents or guardians cannot, for up to one year. The designated adult can make decisions about a child’s care, custody, and medical treatment, but it does not give permission for adoption or marriage. The DOPA form does not take away a parent or guardian’s ability to make decisions for their child. Having this prepared in advance can ensure a child is taken care of in a worst-case scenario, as Maye Quade recounted instances of parents shouting out the names of their children and their school while being arrested by federal agents in hopes that someone will help them.

“Have whistles with you in your car and keep your cellphone charged.”

Maye Quade reaffirmed that it is not illegal to record a federal agent. However, if you do happen to encounter an arrest, it’s important to understand that agents don’t usually differentiate between protestors and observers. Anyone who happens to be around can be targeted, with the senator emphasizing that you should close your car vents and turn off the heat in case you are pepper-sprayed or tear-gassed. It’s also a good idea to keep water or saline spray with you, as both can help remove pepper spray from the eyes.

“Businesses should get very familiar with what their legal rights are.”

Businesses should understand when they have the legal authority to keep people off their private property and how they can enforce a code of conduct. Maye Quade also suggested businesses be prepared for an I-9 audit, when federal agents inspect whether a business has confirmed their workers’ identities and work authorizations. This process does not require a warrant, but agents have to give employers at least three days’ notice.

Here, Maye Quade also emphasized that businesses should become familiar with federal agents’ tactics. In one case, “they used a ruse of a pretend car crash in the parking lot to lure a day care worker out of her house,” she said, while in other instances federal agents have asked passersby for help outside businesses only to arrest them instead.

“The people that are being taken are like us.”

Despite the Trump administration’s insistence that federal agents are targeting “the worst of the worst,” immigrants who have committed crimes or are in the U.S. without permanent legal status, that is not what Maye Quade has witnessed in Minnesota. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and people who have been legally admitted into the country are all being targeted right now. “It’s literally just anyone who’s Black, brown, or Asian. Most of them have status and have broken no law,” she said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

As masked men dressed for war surrounded the car my friend Patty and I sat in, all I could think about were the moments that had led to my neighbor Renee Good’s death. “I’m not mad at you,” she had told her killer. These agents, who I had to assume were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (they never identified themselves), were already banging on our windows and recording us. Then they pepper-sprayed the intake vent of the car. They were definitely mad at us.

“You’re under arrest!” the agents yelled. Terrified, I thrust my hands in the air and waited for instruction. They did not give me any—instead, they shattered our windows and pulled me out. I was roughly handcuffed and shoved into the back of an unmarked Subaru.

I was a recent volunteer to the neighborhood group that had organized to observe and report ICE after Operation Metro Surge began here in Minnesota weeks ago. The efforts had only increased since Good’s killing. In community chats, suspected ICE sightings are reported, their license plates checked against a constantly updated public spreadsheet. If they are confirmed, people in cars drive to the scene to record what the agents are doing and warn people that ICE is in the area with car horns and whistles. Recording, a legally protected action, occurs on public streets.

Most of the time, commuting (as it’s known in activist circles) is boring. You typically drive in circles around familiar streets. Volunteer dispatchers will help coordinate where people should go, but usually they just recommend sticking around areas with lots of brown people: restaurants, community centers, the kinds of places that make Minneapolis vital. Commuting has become so popular as of late that it’s common to hear a dispatcher request that listeners “please leave the call if you are not actively commuting.” Signal calls have limited space.

Occasionally, though, commuting is terrifying. “Have y’all not learned?” an agent provocatively asks a legal observer in a video that’s been circulating among volunteers, two days after Good was killed. Her response, “What’s our lesson here?,” angers him, and he tries to snatch her phone. Agents have also been known to follow commuters to their homes to intimidate them, which means “He’s following me to my house” has become another common refrain on the Signal chat. One time, I suggested that a woman on a call drive to a nearby gas station to meet me because an ICE vehicle was idling outside her home and she was audibly terrified.

I ended up in ICE custody shortly after beginning a commute on Jan. 11. Someone in our neighborhood chat had reported that ICE vehicles were pepper-spraying an observer. Patty and I, not far away, drove there. I was keenly aware of Good’s death when we arrived on the scene—it had been just four days and was a six-minute drive from where she was killed. This was the first time I had ever seen ICE agents in my life (I wasn’t joking when I said some commuter shifts are boring), and that’s when they pepper-sprayed the interior of our car and hauled us out of it. By the time the agents shoved me into that unmarked SUV, three minutes and 30 seconds had elapsed. We didn’t understand why we were being taken in: We hadn’t blocked their cars or done anything beyond routine observing.

Patty, separated from me, was subject to humiliation on her drive in. They called her ugly, took pictures of her, and referred to Renee Good as “that lesbian bitch.” They took us both to the Whipple Federal Building, a place where, the day before, three local lawmakers had been denied access. They had been trying to ascertain the conditions within. As I was being processed, shackled, and led into a cell, I wondered if I would be able to report to the outside world what it was like in there.

In a bare yellow cell, I tried to sleep, but when I closed my eyes, I could hear screaming and crying from deeper inside the facility. My requests to use the bathroom or to drink water were routinely ignored, met only after I banged on the one-way glass in my cell and begged agents directly.

I saw other detainees only when I was finally able to go to the bathroom—presumably, they were the other people that ICE was here to hunt. The looks on their faces horrified me. Through observation glass, I saw more than a dozen people crammed into a cell, seemingly lacking energy. They stared at the ground or at the wall. They didn’t talk to one another. One man pushed his face up against the one-way glass, either trying to see out or just desperate for any kind of stimulation.

Elsewhere, I saw a woman, through an observation glass, using the bathroom. She wore a garment to preserve her modesty, but that could not protect her from three leering agents who stood watching her, making small talk and laughing. She cried on the toilet.

I was lucky—after the eight hours I spent in custody, I was released with no charges. It helped that I had a lawyer, Emanual Williams, whom my family contacted as they tried to piece together what had happened to me.

After I got out, I called Williams to thank him. I asked him if it was difficult to come speak with me. Legal counsel is supposed to always be allowed in the building, even when it’s closed. He told me that things are changing at Whipple. “We’ve started to see a process that’s more dangerous towards U.S. citizens being detained, receiving charges, and being transported to federal jails,” he said.

Often, whether someone in custody gets to see their lawyer simply depends on who is working that day. “Some people at the door have said it’s not possible to see someone unless someone has retained us,” Williams said. “One time, I drove up to the guard post outside of the Whipple building, and they told me it was closed. One of the postmen—I think they were part of the police team—approached my vehicle with pepper spray.”

A video of the arrest of my cellmate, a legal resident named Dennis, shows his body being bent forward into an unmarked van as two agents try to force him in. Dennis’ face is placid. A third agent, trying to be helpful, gropes for pepper spray on his tactical vest.

“Do you want me to spray you?” he demands, thrusting it an inch from Dennis’ eye.

“Don’t spray him, don’t fucking spray him,” the agent in the front of the car scolds his partner, swatting the pepper spray away from Dennis’ face.

“I told him, ‘Go ahead,’ ” Dennis had said to me in our cell, laughing.

Patty and I weren’t the only ones detained for trying to alert people to ICE’s presence and filming agents. We’ve since met four others who had similar experiences. I was never charged with a crime; I now assume that my detention was meant to stop me from recording ICE officers.

The effort to intimidate observers continues, but they haven’t been discouraged. Minneapolis is so organized in its observer responses that increasingly, the agency has spread its activities to the surrounding area, where there aren’t as many residents mobilized, alerted to their presence, and filming them. ICE officers don’t want people to see what they’re doing, which is why it’s more important than ever to document it. My arresting agent stole my whistle. After I got out, I bought a pack of 24 more.

The version of Spencer Pittman visible to the world on social media, at least until last month, was familiar to anyone who has lived in a very Christian part of the country. Pittman, on his Instagram account, posted photos of himself in a baseball uniform in high school and college, action shots on the diamond, and off-field photos of more casual moments with captions such as “God is good. Thankful for my teammates.” On X, he chronicled his college career as an outfielder for Coahoma Community College in western Mississippi, posting his game schedules, his personal records in the gym, and videos of his training captioned with scripture passages. With his gym clothes, cross necklace, floppy hair, and singular fixation on linking all of his efforts and successes to his faith, the 19-year-old Pittman looked like the archetype of the Southern Christian sports bro. In a note accompanying one video of batting practice from late 2024, he wrote: “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Romans 12:18.”

But last week, Pittman confessed to burning down a synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi. It was an act of calculated and ambitious hate, targeting the Beth Israel Synagogue, Jackson’s oldest synagogue and a building that had been firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan back in 1967. Pittman, who was arrested Saturday night after his father contacted the FBI, told investigators he had targeted the “Synagogue of Satan” for its “Jewish ties.” Authorities also say he laughed when his father confronted him and bragged that he “finally got them.” (No one was hurt in the arson.)

The question of how Spencer Pittman was radicalized is, so far, a slightly confounding one. He does not look to be an isolated internet obsessive with overt ties to white nationalists. He appeared to have friends—or at least teammates. He seemed to be from a comfortable suburban background. His life appeared to be a largely offline one, with community in his world of athletics.

There are gaps in our understanding of how Pittman went from a baseball-obsessed teenager to a fanatical antisemite. But he left enough of his digital world visible to the public for us to piece together some clues. Pittman, it seems, had found himself highly active in a strange community on the internet—one of those bizarre new digital spaces where toxic forms of masculinity culture merge with fundamentalist Christianity. This Christian-bro gym culture offers many young men an intoxicating sense of purpose, one in which the pursuit of conventional masculinity is given a kind of divine backing. Depending on who you ask, this culture is part of the manosphere, right-wing purity culture, or reactionary religious politics. But however you categorize this subculture, it may provide some clues to understanding how a gym rat could encounter militant new ideas.

The clearest insight into Pittman’s version of this world came in early January, when he posted a link to a website for a lifestyle brand called “One Purpose.” The site, which according to Mississippi Today was registered to Pittman in December, advertised a kind of wellness subscription service with a mishmash of Gen Z buzzwords and Christian self-help: looksmaxxing (including mewing and “facial aesthetics”), testosterone optimization, scripture memorization, divine schedule optimization, A.I. food scanning, financial tracking, and Bible-based workouts. The brand appeared to take the Bible very literally in its inspiration, scattering Hebrew throughout and promising a diet based on biblical foods (as in those specifically mentioned in scripture, such as figs, olives, and barley) and a health plan that enabled the biblical patriarchs to live for centuries. (“Their secret? Biblical eating patterns, fasting, and walking with God.”) The latter was advertised as a “life-expectancy maxxing protocol.”

If you spend some time on the website, you’ll see signs of how Pittman saw this world—or at least how he was trying to sell it to others. One section of the website explains “Why the World’s Way Has Failed You,” noting that secular diet and workout plans will fail young men because they aren’t pushing them to be disciplined enough. (The site is geared exclusively toward men.) “God’s solution,” on the other hand, asks these men to “build their temple”—their bodies—“for His glory,” giving them proper motivation to hit the gym.

While it may seem baffling to many Christians and non-Christians alike, this kind of exercise-based faith expression is not uncommon among a certain category of young men, experts say. According to Mariel Barnes, a professor who researches gender and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, it offers the same appeal as other factions of the “manosphere”—incels, pickup artists, and male separatists, for example—by emphasizing the power of men and the importance of traditional gender roles.

According to the Rev. Angela Denker, a Lutheran pastor and the author of Disciples of White Jesus: The Radicalization of American Boyhood, that hyperfixation on masculinity is a common element of extreme right-wing Christianity. The vision of a kind of premodern, brutish masculinity provides a comfortingly simple guide for how a young man should act in a complex world—and the religious backing makes him feel more righteous in his belief.

The question of how he got from there to extreme antisemitism is murky. But experts in masculinity and right-wing Christianity noted that the different ideas that fed into this subculture encourage rigid ideology and bold action.

Take, for example, the website’s offer of a “Biblical longevity protocol based on Noah, Moses, and Caleb’s lifespans”—a prominent feature on the page. It sounds like nonsense, but it’s new internet framing of an older idea. The term “life-expectancy maxxing” appears to be original, but some Christians have occasionally claimed that the Bible offers a kind of code to the ideal form of bodily existence. According to Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M University professor who researches technology, religion, and digital culture, in the 1990s, the era of fad dieting, the country saw a revival in biblical dieting, in which people looked through Levitical laws for instruction on nutrition and fasting.

But it’s internet culture that allowed Pittman to package this as a kind of Christian answer to Silicon Valley’s anti-aging movement, in which you can hack your way to a long life with the right interactive tech tool, plus God. There’s nothing hate-oriented about that. Still, it calls on young men to cast off their old interests and influences and remake their lives by embracing a collection of extreme worldviews—in this case, tech’s optimization culture, fundamentalist Christianity, and the manosphere’s aesthetic self-improvement culture. When that level of single-minded intensity is brought to reforming the physical body, Campbell said, it can set the conditions for other kinds of extremism.

“There can be a lot of overlap with different people who tend toward more extremist ideas and behaviors,” Campbell said. “That jump in an extreme in how you treat bodies to an extreme in how you treat culture—that idea of purification—can be twisted to justify certain logic.”

“It’s not just being healthy but resisting anything ‘polluting’ to your body, to your mind, to the culture,” she added.

Pittman clearly saw these things—body, mind, culture—as connected. On Instagram, Pittman posted about what he perceived as the true threats to the world: “How to destroy society: Make discipline cringe. Make truth offensive. Make masculinity shameful.”

These ideas are often articulated in conservative Christian spaces as about being a “warrior” for Christ. The Christian warrior defends society against secular, feminist groups that want to eradicate family values and spread moral confusion. He is not afraid to be strong and fight for what he knows to be Biblical truth.

Usually, pastors advocating for young men to be warriors for Christ don’t mention Judaism. But on the internet, it doesn’t take a lot of searching to find men proclaiming themselves to be devoted Christians who will argue that Jews are behind society’s adoption of feminist and secular values. Pittman was clearly immersed in internet culture. And he appears to have bought into the idea, spread by so many on the Christian right, that it was his duty to stand up against Christianity’s “enemies.”

“It’s a theology of power, of power and dominance, and that does lend itself to antisemitism,” Denker said.

It’s possible that Pittman had become, in some way, confused. We don’t know his mental state before the crime. In December, after years of anodyne baseball photos, he started posting about money and cars. He posted selfies meant to show off his physique, a photo of bloodied knuckles, and videos of him driving at 160 miles per hour. He blasted money as the source of all evil while simultaneously bragging about his sports car and “escaping modern slavery” through stock trading. Finally, the night of the crime, he posted a clip from the Comedy Central show Drawn Together in which an antisemitic character panics about “a Jew in my backyard,” confronting an ugly, yellow-skinned cartoon character with a large nose and money bags. This was a hard swerve from Pittman’s inoffensive baseball posting from just a few weeks before.

It will remain hard to piece together Pittman’s path there because he, like every young man on the internet, could have constructed it from any number of sources. He didn’t need a single pastor or priest or denomination to tell him his views; he could have turned to podcasters, influencers, meme pages, YouTube pastors, and any other number of figures for inspiration. Some observers have been quick to point out that Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes have used the phrase “Synagogue of Satan.” But Pittman just as easily could have picked it up from any antisemite: The phrase, used in the Bible to refer to persecutors, has a long history of misuse, including by the KKK, Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam, the televangelist Billy Graham, and various modern Christian white supremacist groups. Until he tells us where he learned it, we can’t know what his inspiration was.

But what we do know is that for young men like Pittman, the internet is awash in groups ready to prey on their confusion and insecurities and tell them that if they only remake themselves to be strong enough, masculine enough, driven enough, powerful enough, they’ll get the approval they want—whether it’s from women, society, or God.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CISOs must prepare for &quot;a really different world&quot; where cybercriminals can reliably automate cyberattacks at scale, according to a senior Googler.

Heather Adkins, veep of security engineering at the ad and cloud giant, said it probably won&#39;t be for a few years to come, but cybercriminals are already using AI to enhance small parts of their workflows, and it won&#39;t be long before a full, end-to-end toolkit is developed.

In a conversation held on the Google Cloud Security podcast, Adkins pointed out that crooks are already using AI for small tasks - grammar, spell-checking phishing copy and other productivity enhancements.

&quot;It&#39;s just a matter of time before somebody puts all of these things together, end-to-end,&quot; she said. &quot;And what I fear the most is somebody developing the capability to prompt a model to hack any company, and the model being able to come back in a week with a root prompt. If that ends up happening, I think it&#39;ll be a slow ramp over the next six to 18 months.

&quot;We&#39;re also seeing defense pick up the same tools and use them for the same purposes, so it may not feel as shocking. Of course, things could go very differently, but these are the things that should be on everyone&#39;s mind and we should be getting ready for a really different world.&quot;

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) published an overview of the most recent developments in how attackers are experimenting with AI, noting that malware families are already using LLMs to generate commands in order to steal victim data.

Sandra Joyce, VP at GTIG, added that China, Iran, and North Korea are all abusing AI tools to aid different stages of their respective attacks. These include initial network reconnaissance and C2 development, as well as the aforementioned phishing copy and data-stealing commands.

The fear among senior Googlers is that these small components will be chained together and provide similar functionality to today&#39;s exploit kits.

Anton Chuvakin, security advisor at Google&#39;s office of the CISO, said: &quot;To me, the more serious threat isn&#39;t the APT, it&#39;s the Metasploit moment [when exploit frameworks became easily accessible 20 years ago]. I worry about the democratization of threats.&quot;

Exploit kits such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike started out as legitimate pentesting tools, but cracked versions soon made their way into attackers&#39; hands, making their post-compromise lives significantly easier. Experts fear a similar end once AI-powered toolkits are acquired by the wrong people.

For Adkins, a worst-case scenario of an AI-enabled attack could look something like a Morris worm-type event that spreads an autonomously executing ransomware toolkit, encrypting computers en masse, for example.

&quot;Or it could look something like the Conficker worm that didn&#39;t really do anything, but everybody still panicked and wrote thousand-page government reports on it,&quot; she added.

&quot;Maybe an altruistic person unleashes it on the world and it patches a bunch of bugs. It really just depends on who puts the pieces together, and their motives.&quot;

As for now, LLMs are still struggling with the basics. From discerning right from wrong, to more technical wrinkles like being unable to switch from strange thought paths when looking for vulnerabilities, AI requires some progress before we see the best or worst of it.

However, when or if that day comes, attackers may gain an even greater first-mover advantage over defenders. When criminals can prompt an AI tool to compromise a given organization, leaving the victim little time to respond, that could force the good guys to redefine success in the post-AI era.

Post-AI cyber success may not be measured by whether an attacker breaks into a network, but by how long they are inside, and by how little damage they can cause.

Adkins said that in a cloud context, AI-enabled defenses should simply turn off an instance if it detects malicious activity, but implementing these systems will have to be done carefully so as not to cause problems.

&quot;We&#39;re going to have to put these intelligent reasoning systems behind real-time decision-making and disrupt decision-making on the ground, without causing reliability problems,&quot; she said. &quot;Maybe you need human approval. Or you shut down one instance and turn up another one.

&quot;There are options other than just the on/off switch, but we have to start reasoning about real-time disruption capabilities or degradation, and use the whole information operations playbook to change the battlefield to confuse AI attackers. Particularly because they&#39;re stumbling around in the dark a little bit and may be less resilient than human attackers.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft recently announced it will deprecate System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) Management Packs (MPs) for SQL Server Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server,and SQL Server Analysis Services.

While this affects a relatively small subset of SQL Server users, the move could force some organizations into monitoring solutions that expose their server deployments to Microsoft&#39;s licensing auditors, one analyst pointed out.

The affected SCOM management packs will remain available until January 2027, after which they&#39;ll no longer be supported. &quot;No new updates will be released, including no support for SQL Server 2025 or SCOM 2025,&quot; the notice said.

Microsoft said the products would no longer have official SCOM MPs for these products.

SCOM is a popular management tool for Microsoft on-premises server product, supporting not just SQL Server, but also Exchange, Windows and SharePoint to manage updates, security changes, and patches.

Microsoft said the deprecation means existing management packs would continue to function in SCOM 2019 and SCOM 2022, but no new features, fixes, or security updates would be provided. And compatibility with later versions can not be guaranteed.

The software giant recommended affected users plan their migration to Azure-based monitoring solutions using Azure Monitor, Azure Arc and Log Analytics. This creates &quot;a unified alternative that offers centralized telemetry ingestion, alerting, performance monitoring, and dashboarding for hybrid and on‑premises environments,&quot; the vendor claimed.

Andrew Snodgrass, analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said the Windows giant had ignored SCOM for a while, and he was advising clients to move away from it.

&quot;Find a third party if you want to stay on-prem, but Microsoft&#39;s gonna start slowly killing this thing off the way they do,&quot; he told The Reg. With the alternative, customers can no longer download updates directly; they can only do it through Azure Arc, and in the process, they have to register their on-prem servers in Azure.

Snodgrass said the Azure monitoring platform offered some &quot;really cool stuff&quot; for managing a SQL Server estate, especially hybrid users.

&quot;What it requires is that – quite reasonably – you install an agent on your physical server or on your virtual server, whether that&#39;s in AWS, Azure or on-prem. This is the Azure Arc monitoring agent that is going to run locally, and it&#39;s going to connect up to Azure,&quot; he said.

From a management point of view it works well, added Snodgrass, because admins can use a single Azure SQL management system and see all the servers and databases, regardless of their environment.

&quot;But those who don&#39;t want to use Azure, or want to remain on-prem, will need to find an alternative local third-party management tool. SQL Server has been out for decades, so there&#39;s some really lovely management tools. There are also a few that will also manage your Windows Server and your Exchange servers as well.&quot;

Although Microsoft has given no indication that the data could be used for anything other than software management, users should be aware that there is the potential for implications when it comes to license management.

&quot;If you use the Azure SQL to manage all of these deployments, wherever they are, whether they&#39;re on prem or in AWS or Azure, then you&#39;re registering every one of your SQL Servers with Azure. That list is going to be out. Doesn&#39;t mean that Microsoft necessarily would, but if an audit comes along, they certainly could go out there and say, &#39;You know what, you&#39;ve got this whole list here, and we look at the license count that you bought from us, and you don&#39;t have enough licenses to cover all these servers you&#39;ve deployed&#39;,&quot; he said.

Organizations deliberately using unlicensed software do not have much of a defense, but there are grey areas, such as downloading SQL Server for software development using a Visual Studio license.

&quot;If I were monitoring and managing all this stuff through the Azure tools, it can&#39;t delineate between production and development, and it would assume that all for those are production machines, and therefore I should buy licenses for them.&quot;

Snodgrass advises clients to get a clear picture of the number of SQL Servers in production and those used for development before negotiating with Microsoft over licenses.

The Register has asked Microsoft to comment. ®

            <h2>Tesla Full Self Driving subscription to rise alongside its capabilities</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/23/tesla_full_self_driving_subscription/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Having confirmed Tesla will start charging $99 a month for supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD), CEO Elon Musk has told the faithful that the cost will rise &quot;as FSD&#39;s capabilities improve.&quot;

Musk revealed the plan on his social media mouthpiece, X (formerly Twitter), on January 23, a week after stating that the hands-free driving technology would shift from an $8,000 one-off payment to a subscription-only model in February.

Tesla announced the change to a monthly subscription on January 14. It will shift to a subscription model for FSD on February 14, and Musk&#39;s post indicates the $99 per month fee will rise before long, though he did not give a date or amount, just saying it would happen as the technology gets better.

The electric vehicle maker is not averse to fiddling with price lists; the FSD feature reached a high of $15,000 in September 2022 before being reduced to $8,000 in 2024. The $99-per-month option offers better value, though the idea of a subscription can be controversial.

A price increase, however, reduces the value proposition.

&quot;The massive value jump,&quot; wrote Musk, &quot;is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).&quot;

Musk has promised great things of FSD for years, and Tesla has become the target of several sueballs over the technology. Investigations have also opened regarding the safety of the system, which relies on cameras and AI to keep its vehicles on track rather than features including radar and lidar.

Musk did not clarify exactly what increase in FSD capability justifies a subscription payment hike. If Tesla waits until FSD reaches the point where it can be trusted to pilot a vehicle with the driver asleep at the wheel, then it seems unlikely the corporation&#39;s value will increase in time to trigger Musk&#39;s bonus payout.

In addition, modern hands-free systems mean that operating a cellphone is perfectly possible from a moving vehicle.

Tesla is not the only automaker to move its customers to a subscription model and remove a one-off payment option, notwithstanding BMW&#39;s ill-fated heated seat adventure. Musk is, however, notable for saying the quiet part out loud: price rises could arrive faster than an out-of-control car, careening down the highway. ®

            <h2>Devs begin to assess options for MySQL's future beyond Oracle</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/23/mysql_post_oracle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Developers in the MySQL community are working together to challenge Oracle to improve transparency and commitment in its handling of the popular open source database, while considering other options, including forking the code.

At a meeting in San Francisco earlier this month, a group of interested members of the MySQL community met to discuss recent concerns about the handling of the system upon which many had built companies and careers.

Recent job losses at Oracle&#39;s MySQL core development team — the database&#39;s founding developer Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius said he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; on hearing the news — and a dramatically falling number of commits to the project have led some to believe it is reaching a critical crossroads.

Vadim Tkachenko previously worked for MySQL AB, the Swedish company that developed the database before it was bought by Sun Microsystems, which later merged with Oracle. Now CTO at open source consultancy Percona, Tkachenko told The Register that MySQL was at a fork in the road under Oracle&#39;s management, with the developer community now having to choose its future: either under Oracle or as part of a different model.

Peter Zaitsev, Percona co-founder and MySQL performance expert, said Oracle&#39;s treatment of MySQL was like the metaphor of boiling a frog: the critical point for MySQL might not be understood until it is too late.

&quot;They are moving more and more features to their cloud and enterprise software, and then they have been reducing MySQL staff, but they have not done anything drastic. The result for the MySQL community, though, is not great. It&#39;s not really getting MySQL developed to its full potential,&quot; he said.

In response, a group of developers got together in the US to discuss potential options for the future of MySQL. The group included engineers from Percona and PlanetScale, which has built a database service around Vitess, a distributed MySQL-based database.

Sam Lambert, PlanetScale co-founder and CEO, said: &quot;MySQL is critical to the functioning of the web and powers millions of products. PlanetScale is committed to its future. We maintain our own fork of MySQL... We will always back MySQL as a technology and use our engineering resources to ensure its health. It&#39;s our hope that we can do this as part of an open and flourishing community.&quot;

The group meeting was not specifically meant for users, but more for developers who contributed code and companies built around open source MySQL. A representative from Oracle also attended, Zaitsev said.

&quot;I appreciate they actually did that, because it was obviously not an event where they&#39;re going to get a lot of love, so that&#39;s good they came,&quot; he said.

The options on the table were leaving the governance of MySQL with Oracle or creating a fork of the open source database for a community to develop and govern. Such a fork could either be a hard fork or a tracking fork, Zaitsev explained.

A hard fork is exemplified by MariaDB, which Widenius forked in 2009. The database remains open source, governed by a foundation, and is linked to a separate company, MariaDB plc. It has developed separately from MySQL since it was forked.

Zaitsev said Percona&#39;s Server for MySQL, which the company says offers enterprise-grade features in open source packaging, is an example of a tracking fork. &quot;We apply certain patches, and certain other changes, but we are always tracking that [against MySQL]. A tracking fork typically brings more compatibility than a hard fork, far more compatible with MySQL compared with MariaDB,&quot; he said.

The group plans further meetings, including one focused on developers in Europe, set to be held around the Open Source Conference Fosdem 26. Fosdem is happening in Brussels over the last weekend of January. It might take further feedback before deciding the best way forward.

The open source community has a track record of wresting control of projects by forking code from vendor-associated systems. For example, the Linux Foundation launched Valkey in 2024, forking code from popular cache/database Redis. It was backed by AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap, as well as Percona.

Zaitsev said the MySQL group had spoken to major cloud vendors in the US and elsewhere, as well as smaller cloud companies.

He told us: &quot;A lot of them have their customers [that] are feeling the pain from missing features in MySQL, like vector search for example. But I&#39;m not going to disclose any kind of commitment before it goes official.&quot;

Whatever the outcome, it&#39;s likely there is strong feeling in the MySQL developer community that Oracle&#39;s recent approach merits a response. The Register asked Oracle to comment. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/23/fortinet_fortigate_patch/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fortinet has confirmed that attackers are actively bypassing a December patch for a critical FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) authentication flaw after customers reported suspicious logins on devices supposedly fully up to date.

In a new advisory, Fortinet said it had identified a fresh attack path being used to abuse SAML-based SSO in FortiOS, even on systems that had already applied the vendor&#39;s earlier fix.

The disclosure follows reports earlier this week that FortiGate firewalls were quietly reconfigured via compromised SSO accounts, with attackers altering firewall settings, creating backdoor admin users, and exfiltrating configuration files.

Arctic Wolf said the campaign kicked off around January 15, with attackers spinning up VPN-enabled accounts and ripping out firewall configuration files in a matter of seconds – behavior strongly suggesting automation rather than careful, hands-on-keyboard work. The security firm added that the activity closely mirrors incidents it observed back in December, in the wake of Fortinet&#39;s disclosure of the supposedly patched SSO authentication bypass flaw.

&quot;Recently, a small number of customers reported unexpected login activity occurring on their devices, which appeared very similar to the previous issue,&quot; said Fortinet chief information security officer Carl Windsor.

&quot;However, in the last 24 hours, we have identified a number of cases where the exploit was to a device that had been fully upgraded to the latest release at the time of the attack, which suggested a new attack path.&quot;

&quot;Fortinet product security has identified the issue, and the company is working on a fix to remediate this occurrence,&quot; Windsor said. &quot;An advisory will be issued as the fix scope and timeline is available.&quot;

While exploitation has so far only been observed via FortiCloud SSO, Windsor warned that the underlying weakness is not limited to that service.

&quot;It is important to note that while, at this time, only exploitation of FortiCloud SSO has been observed, this issue is applicable to all SAML SSO implementations.&quot; That&#39;s not the sort of detail likely to calm anyone responsible for keeping these boxes locked down.

Fortinet has not yet published technical details of the alternate attack path, though the company says investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, it has advised customers to review authentication logs for any unexpected login activity, restrict exposure of the management interface, and closely monitor changes to administrator accounts.

For now, Fortinet customers are left watching the logs and waiting for another fix — this time hoping it actually closes the door. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon saw his pay packet swell to $29.7 million in fiscal 2025, up from $25.91 million the year before, even as Qualcomm&#39;s full-year net income fell 45 percent.

According to the chip giant&#39;s latest proxy filing [PDF], Amon&#39;s compensation for the year comprised a $1.35 million base salary, $24.16 million in stock awards, $3.19 million in non-equity incentives, and just over $1 million in other compensation.

Salary itself was unchanged year-on-year, with the 15 percent uplift driven almost entirely by equity and incentive pay.

The bump came in a year when Qualcomm reported full-year revenue of $44.3 billion, up 14 percent, but net income plunged 45 percent to $5.5 billion after the company booked a hefty non-cash tax charge tied to changes in US tax law. In other words, sales were up, profits went backwards, and executive pay kept climbing anyway.

Amon was not the only Qualcomm exec enjoying a healthy payday. CFO and COO Akash Palkhiwala took home $13.14 million in total compensation, while EVP and president Alexander Rogers earned $9.7 million. CTO Baaziz Achor received $9.46 million.

By contrast, Qualcomm calculated the annual total compensation of its median employee at $101,639, putting Amon&#39;s pay at roughly 292 times that figure.

Operationally, 2025 gave Qualcomm enough positives to keep investors upbeat. Fourth-quarter revenue climbed to $11.27 billion, up 10 percent year-on-year, driven in part by record quarterly automotive chip sales of $1.1 billion. Amon described that milestone as evidence that Qualcomm is now a serious player in a market long dominated by traditional automotive suppliers.

Amon also used the company&#39;s earnings call to flesh out plans to cautiously push Qualcomm into the datacenter. He confirmed the company is developing both a system-on-chip and an accelerator &quot;card&quot; for AI inference workloads, arguing that datacenter growth is shifting away from energy-hungry training toward more efficient inference at scale.

&quot;AI datacenter growth is moving from training to dedicated inference workloads, and this trend is expected to accelerate,&quot; Amon told analysts, while stressing that Qualcomm does not expect &quot;material&quot; datacenter revenue until 2027.

Not all of Qualcomm&#39;s optimism rests on AI. Amon struck a bullish note on the company&#39;s PC chips, saying there is still room for growth, and pointed to continued strength in modems and communications silicon, even after Apple opted to build its own modems rather than continue buying from Qualcomm.

He also went out of his way to mention Qualcomm&#39;s relationship with Samsung, noting the company expects to supply around 75 percent of the processors used in the Galaxy S26. That comment came shortly after the Korean giant signaled it wants to strengthen its own high-end smartphone processors following its decision to rely exclusively on Qualcomm chips in the Galaxy S25.

As ever, shareholders will get a non-binding say-on-pay vote at Qualcomm&#39;s annual meeting. Whether they view a near-$30 million CEO payday as well-earned in a year when profits fell sharply, and datacenter revenues remain a promise rather than a reality, is likely to be one of the more closely watched signals to come out of the meeting. ®

Marshall has announced a new music streaming hub called the Heddon that can broadcast to multiple speakers using the Bluetooth Auracast feature that’s finally starting to catch on. Similar to Sennheiser’s BTA1 TV Transmitter announced earlier this week, the Heddon doesn’t require wireless audio devices to go through a pairing process to stream audio, as long as they also support Bluetooth Auracast. But while Sennheiser’s transmitter has an HDMI port for broadcasting audio from movies and TV shows, Marshall’s focuses on music.

The Heddon hub includes Wi-Fi which is used to directly connect to streaming services including Spotify Connect and Tidal. Other platforms like Apple Music can be used, but they need to be streamed through other devices like your phone that connect to the hub using AirPlay or Google Cast.

Marshall says the Heddon’s Auracast broadcasting is compatible with its Acton III, Stanmore III, and Woburn III Bluetooth speakers. Assuming it’s using a standard Bluetooth connection and not a proprietary implementation, any wireless speaker, headphones, earbuds, or even hearing aids that support Auracast should be able to access its broadcasts.

Older versions of Marshall’s wireless speakers, including its Acton II and Stanmore II, can only connect to the Heddon using RCA to AUX or RCA to RCA cables, and just one at a time. While the hub has two stereo pairs of RCA ports on the back, only one is for connecting to a speaker. The other two are line in ports for connecting older audio devices like a record player.

The Marshall Heddon is available now for $299.99, which is more than twice as expensive as Sennheiser’s $129.95 BTA1 transmitter. When purchased with an Acton III, Stanmore III, or Woburn III wireless speaker the Heddon will get a half price discount. And if you buy two or more of the aforementioned speakers, Marshall will include the hub for free.

﻿ChatGPT Health promises privacy. All you have is OpenAI’s word.

Every week, more than 230 million people ask ChatGPT for health and wellness advice, according to OpenAI. The company says that many see the chatbot as an “ally” to help navigate the maze of insurance, file paperwork, and become better self-advocates. In exchange, it hopes you will trust its chatbot with details about your diagnoses, medications, test results, and other private medical information. But while talking to a chatbot may be starting to feel a bit like the doctor’s office, it isn’t one. Tech companies aren’t bound by the same obligations as medical providers. Experts tell The Verge it would be wise to carefully consider whether you want to hand over your records.

Health and wellness is swiftly emerging as a key battleground for AI labs and a major test for how willing users are to welcome these systems into their lives. This month two of the industry’s biggest players made overt pushes into medicine. OpenAI released ChatGPT Health, a dedicated tab within ChatGPT designed for users to ask health-related questions in what it says is a more secure and personalized environment. Anthropic introduced Claude for Healthcare, a “HIPAA-ready” product it says can be used by hospitals, health providers, and consumers. (Notably absent is Google, whose Gemini chatbot is one of the world’s most competent and widely used AI tools, though the company did announce an update to its MedGemma medical AI model for developers.)

OpenAI actively encourages users to share sensitive information like medical records, lab results, and health and wellness data from apps like Apple Health, Peloton, Weight Watchers, and MyFitnessPal with ChatGPT Health in exchange for deeper insights. It explicitly states that users’ health data will be kept confidential and won’t be used to train AI models, and that steps have been taken to keep data secure and private. OpenAI says ChatGPT Health conversations will also be held in a separate part of the app, with users able to view or delete Health “memories” at any time.

OpenAI’s assurances that it will keep users’ sensitive data safe have been helped in no small way by the company launching an identical-sounding product with tighter security protocols at almost the same time as ChatGPT Health. The tool, called ChatGPT for Healthcare, is part of a broader range of products sold to support businesses, hospitals, and clinicians working with patients directly. OpenAI’s suggested uses include streamlining administrative work like drafting clinical letters and discharge summaries and helping physicians collate the latest medical evidence to improve patient care. Similar to other enterprise-grade products sold by the company, there are greater protections in place than offered to general consumers, especially free users, and OpenAI says the products are designed to comply with the privacy obligations required of the medical sector. Given the similar names and launch dates — ChatGPT for Healthcare was announced the day after ChatGPT Health — it is all too easy to confuse the two and presume the consumer-facing product has the same level of protection as the more clinically oriented one. Numerous people I spoke to when reporting this story did so.

Even if you trust a company’s vow to safeguard your data… it might just change its mind.

Whichever security assurance we take, however, it is far from watertight. Users for tools like ChatGPT Health often have little safeguarding against breaches or unauthorized use beyond what’s in the terms of use and privacy policies, experts tell The Verge. As most states haven’t enacted comprehensive privacy laws — and there isn’t a comprehensive federal privacy law — data protection for AI tools like ChatGPT Health “largely depends on what companies promise in their privacy policies and terms of use,” says Sara Gerke, a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Even if you trust a company’s vow to safeguard your data — OpenAI says it encrypts Health data by default — it might just change its mind. “While ChatGPT does state in their current terms of use that they will keep this data confidential and not use them to train their models, you are not protected by law, and it is allowed to change terms of use over time,” explains Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in digital health law at the University of Basel in Switzerland. “You will have to trust that ChatGPT does not do so.” Carmel Shachar, an assistant clinical professor of law at Harvard Law School, concurs: “There’s very limited protection. Some of it is their word, but they could always go back and change their privacy practices.”

Assurances that a product is compliant with data protection laws governing the healthcare sector like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, shouldn’t offer much comfort either, Shachar says. While great as a guide, there’s little at stake if a company that voluntarily complies fails to do so, she explains. Voluntarily complying isn’t the same as being bound. “The value of HIPAA is that if you mess up, there’s enforcement.”

There’s a reason why medicine is a heavily regulated field

It’s more than just privacy. There’s a reason why medicine is a heavily regulated field — errors can be dangerous, even lethal. There are no shortage of examples showing chatbots confidently spouting false or misleading health information, such as when a man developed a rare condition after he asked ChatGPT about removing salt from his diet and the chatbot suggested he replace salt with the sodium bromide, which was historically used as a sedative. Or when Google’s AI Overviews wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods — the exact opposite of what they should be doing.

To address this, OpenAI explicitly states that their consumer-facing tool is designed to be used in close collaboration with physicians and is not intended for diagnosis and treatment. Tools designed for diagnosis and treatment are designated as medical devices and are subject to much stricter regulations, such as clinical trials to prove they work and safety monitoring once deployed. Although OpenAI is fully and openly aware that one of the major use cases of ChatGPT is supporting users’ health and well-being — recall the 230 million people asking for advice each week — the company’s assertion that it is not intended as a medical device carries a lot of weight with regulators, Gerke explains. “The manufacturer’s stated intended use is a key factor in the medical device classification,” she says, meaning companies that say tools aren’t for medical use will largely escape oversight even if products are being used for medical purposes. It underscores the regulatory challenges technology like chatbots are posing.

For now, at least, this disclaimer keeps ChatGPT Health out of the purview of regulators like the Food and Drug Administration, but van Kolfschooten says it’s perfectly reasonable to ask whether or not tools like this should really be classified as a medical device and regulated as such. It’s important to look at how it’s being used, as well as what the company is saying, she explains. When announcing the product, OpenAI suggested people could use ChatGPT Health to interpret lab results, track health behavior, or help them reason through treatment decisions. If a product is doing this, one could reasonably argue it might fall under the US definition of a medical device, she says, suggesting that Europe’s stronger regulatory framework may be the reason why it’s not available in the region yet.

“When a system feels personalized and has this aura of authority, medical disclaimers will not necessarily challenge people’s trust in the system.”

Despite claiming ChatGPT is not to be used for diagnosis or treatment, OpenAI has gone through a great deal of effort to prove that ChatGPT is a pretty capable medic and encourage users to tap it for health queries. The company highlighted health as a major use case when launching GPT-5, and CEO Sam Altman even invited a cancer patient and her husband on stage to discuss how the tool helped her make sense of the diagnosis. The company says it assesses ChatGPT’s medical prowess against a benchmark it developed itself with more than 260 physicians across dozens of specialties, HealthBench, that “tests how well AI models perform in realistic health scenarios,” though critics note it is not very transparent. Other studies — often small, limited, or run by the company itself — hint at ChatGPT’s medical potential too, showing that in some cases it can pass medical licensing exams, communicate better with patients, and outperform doctors at diagnosing illness, as well as help doctors make fewer mistakes when used as a tool.

OpenAI’s efforts to present ChatGPT Health as an authoritative source of health information could also undermine any disclaimers it includes telling users not to utilize it for medical purposes, van Kolfschooten says. “When a system feels personalized and has this aura of authority, medical disclaimers will not necessarily challenge people’s trust in the system.”

Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are hoping they have that trust as they jostle for prominence in what they see as the next big market for AI. The figures showing how many people are already using AI chatbots for health suggest they may be onto something, and given the stark health inequalities and difficulties many face in accessing even basic care, this could be a good thing. At least, it could be, if that trust is well-placed. We trust our private information with healthcare providers because the profession has earned that trust. It’s not yet clear whether an industry with a reputation for moving fast and breaking things has earned the same.

The science behind the storm is an active area of study.

Most of the US is bracing for a prolonged stretch of frigid weather and a massive winter storm that could wreak havoc on roads and power grids over the next several days.

At least 170 million Americans are under winter weather alerts. “Bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills” will linger even after the storm is done dumping heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain across the Southern Rockies all the way to New England through Monday, the National Weather Service (NWS) warned Friday. Forecasters expect low temperatures to break numerous records, with wind chills as frigid as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the Northern Plains.

It’s been a bit difficult for forecasters to get a good sense early on of where this storm will be headed and who will be hardest hit. It’s driven by complex factors scientists are still working to better understand, starting with bitter-cold Arctic air set on a collision course with a weather system moving inland from the Pacific Ocean that’s loaded with moisture.

“It’s not setting up like a normal winter storm.”

“It’s not setting up like a normal winter storm,” says Andrea Lopez Lang, an associate professor and atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The effects could be particularly long-lasting. And with such a large swath of the US affected, there is likely to be a wide range of effects from place to place. “Make sure that you’re paying attention to your local forecasts, because the impacts can be very different, even though this is all part of the same system,” Lopez Lang advises.

Parts of the Arctic are enveloped in darkness for months at a time in the winter, allowing the air to get consistently colder. Normally, a current of strong winds called the jet stream keeps that Arctic air from drastically affecting temperatures further south. But a large high-pressure system has allowed the jet stream to dip, letting extremely cold air reach further down into Canada and the US.

When that moisture-packed weather system from the Pacific moves far enough inland to crash into the jet stream, the combination of wet and cold conditions can create a cascade of hazards from snow and freezing rain. The latter, which happens when raindrops freeze upon hitting a surface, allows ice to build up on roads and infrastructure. The persistent cold after the storm prolongs the risk.

“The storm will cause significant to locally catastrophic ice accumulations with the potential for long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions,” NWS says in its forecast. Ice is heavy, which could bring down power lines and leave some homes without electricity or heat in an outage. The deadly cold spell in Texas in 2021 left millions of homes without heat after ice clogged up gas pipelines.

It’s too early to say exactly what role climate change might play in this particular storm. There were unique triggers for this storm, however, that might have been influenced by a shifting climate. For one, the atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which can lead to heavier downpours with storm systems.

The jet stream has also gotten wackier. The difference in temperature between the tropics and the poles historically has kept it relatively consistent. But the Arctic is warming even faster than the rest of the planet. And as the difference in temperature becomes less pronounced, the more the jet stream buckles — allowing Arctic air to penetrate further south when the jet stream meanders.

Severe cold snaps like this one have actually become less common with rising global temperatures. That can pose its own challenges because communities might not be as prepared to cope with them when they do arrive, experts tell The Verge. And they stress that it’s important to understand that climate change can influence extreme events of all kinds, not only heat.

“People say, ‘Oh, well, it’s really cold or we’re getting a lot of snow — how is the world warming?’ Climate change is an increase in the baseline temperatures, but it’s also an increase in extremes from both ways,” says Kaitlyn Trudeau, a senior research associate at the nonprofit Climate Central. “It can make more extreme cold outcomes; it can make more extreme warm outcomes … judging climate change by a cold storm is like judging a baseball season by a single inning.”

Lopez Lang is bracing for the impact of the storm in Wisconsin, both on her home and her work. Weather permitting, she and her colleagues are planning to fly into the storm as it makes its way off the east coast to study how it evolves. They’ll be aboard a NASA aircraft taking measurements of water vapor, temperature, and other factors influencing this event. They want to study the structure of the storm to better understand what happens when a weather system like the one causing trouble this week meets the jet stream.

After all, some of the initial questions over how the storm would unfold this week stem from forecasters trying to figure out when and how that merge would occur. “These mergers [are] big components of the uncertainty in forecasts,” Lopez Lang says. “So we want to make sure that we’re observing them really well so that we can get the best data to make the best forecasts.”

There aren’t many tech companies that can claim Sony’s level of influence in how we live our lives. From the Walkman to the PlayStation to the Trinitron, Sony has been making excellent gadgets in multiple categories for decades, which makes this week’s news just a little sad. Sony’s new joint venture with TCL isn’t the end of Sony TVs — and it might even be good news — but it’s certainly the end of an era.

On this episode of The Vergecast, Nilay and David discuss the Sony / TCL deal, Sony’s legacy in televisions, and what it all might mean for anyone shopping for a new set. The deal isn’t done, and we don’t know all that much about it yet, but it’s already pretty clear what’s in it for both parties.

After that, the hosts wade into the week’s AI news, which all seems to center on a single question: how is anyone supposed to make money from all this technology? OpenAI apparently thinks the answer is ads, because of course it does, because so does everyone else. Apple apparently thinks the answer is hardware, for the same reasons. The hardware discussion leads us to a bigger question about AI gadgets: what is the best form factor for AI? We don’t know. Maybe the answer is none of them. But we rank some ideas anyway.

Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for another installment of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, plus some talk about Netflix’s upcoming mobile redesign, some unimpressive Telly numbers, the Trump Phone, and the latest real estate plans for Nilay’s hometown.

Anbernic has announced its second wireless controller through a teaser video on YouTube highlighting its features. The company’s first gamepad, the RG P01, offered features like Hall effect triggers and joysticks for just $18. Pricing for the new Anbernic RG G01 hasn’t been revealed, but it may be more expensive due to several upgrades, including a curved color display on the front and a heart rate sensor.

The RG G01 won’t be the first controller with a built-in screen. Companies like Turtle Beach already offer them. While a display adds to the cost, it lets gamers adjust settings, program macros that automatically trigger a series of button presses, and remap controls, without having to leave a game and connect to a mobile or desktop app. The RG G01 has four customizable buttons on the back that can be reconfigured using the display.

As for the heart rate sensor that appears to be integrated into the RG G01’s grips? Its functionality is questionable. Nintendo announced a heart rate-tracking accessory for the Wii at E3 2009 called the Vitality Sensor that could have potentially incorporated a player’s pulse into games, but it was cancelled. Anbernic’s RG G01 will display your heart rate on the controller’s screen and it has a pulse alarm, but there’s no details on what exactly it will warn you about.

The RG G01 will include both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, and the option to tether to a device with a USB-C cable. It’s fully compatible with systems running Steam, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, and Nintendo’s various Switch consoles. There’s a six-axis gyroscope for playing games with motion controls, “electro-inductive capacitive joysticks,” and dual-mode triggers with switches that limit their travel for faster response times – a feature that was noticeably missing from the Anbernic RG P01.

Anbernic only says the controller is “Coming Soon!”

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology. Read the full story. This story first appeared in The Spark, our newsletter all about the tech we can use to combat the climate crisis. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Wednesday.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.

            <h2>Can AI replace the humanity of Classical Music?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <h2>Berlin’s Cloover secures over $1.2 Billion to build the “Shopify of Energy”</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/berlins-cloover-secures-over-1-2-billion-to-build-the-shopify-of-energy">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <h2>When corporate knowledge becomes invaluable</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/when-corporate-knowledge-becomes-invaluable">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.
