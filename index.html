            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Guitarists today are spoiled for choice, and that goes doubly true for players who use computer-based amp modeling software. I’m one such player, and I don’t miss the size, weight, deafening volume, or cost of owning an amp and cabinet collection, to say nothing of all those pedals and cables. For clean to mid-gain tones alone, I already have more terrific options than I need, including Neural DSP’s Tone King and Cory Wong and Mateus Asato, Polychrome DSP’s Lumos, and Universal Audio’s new Paradise Guitar Studio. All work slightly differently, but they can each output record-ready tones that are really, really close to the (often incredibly expensive) hardware that they model, and they each give you plenty of great-sounding presets to start from.

So do we really need one amp sim package?

Neural DSP thinks we do, because the Finnish company just dropped a major new release yesterday called Archetype: John Mayer X. It doesn’t model Mayer’s type of gear but his actual hardware units, along with all the actual settings he uses in the studio and on stage. It even has some presets that he designed. Which is great if you want to sound like John Mayer—but what does the software offer for those of us not trying to cover Continuum?

To find out, I spent a few hours playing with Mayer X, and I came away impressed. Neural DSP has released so many metal amp sims in the last few years that I’ve come to associate the company with downtuned chugga-chugga. Don’t get me wrong: I like long hair, skulls, and palm-muted riffs as much as the next person, but it’s nice to have some variety.

Mayer X brings that variety by modeling three of Mayer’s amps: a 1964 Fender Vibroverb, a Dumble Steel String Singer #002, and a not-yet-released prototype Two-Rock. Each amp also comes with a model of its associated speaker cabinet, in front of which you can freely position zero, one, or two microphones to shape the recorded sound and to control the room tone as desired.

This is standard practice for Neural DSP’s “Archetypes” line, but one wrinkle is the new “three-in-one amp” mode that blends the sounds from all amps at once. Here’s the marketing speak: “It merges all three amps and their matching cabinets with Mayer’s exact settings, mic placements, and EQ decisions, creating a unified, dimensional sound that reflects his full signal path without requiring individual amp balancing.” In this mode, each amp gets a single knob, but you are always free to turn this off and use one particular amp instead, which exposes more controls for that unit.

Also new here is an effect that Neural calls the “Gravity Tank.” This effects unit combines Mayer’s “favorite spring reverb” with the harmonic tremolo found in the Victoria Reverberato. It sounds great; while I like spring reverbs for character, especially on guitar parts, some are a bit too “drippy” for me. And although this one definitely sounds like a spring, it’s subtle and spacious rather than clangy or overly metallic, and the tremolo—which you can sync to your DAW’s tempo—sounds terrific too.

Instead of a compressor pedal at the front of the amp, as in many Neural DSP plugins, the Mayer X Archetype features a rack-mounted compressor (this one is modeled off the famous Distressor) that comes after the amp. The controls are much simpler than a real Distressor, but under the hood, Neural says that it is using “Mayer’s exact attack, release, and sidechain settings”; users, however, only need to spin the Input and Output dials.

Above the compressor is an EQ, but unlike Neural’s usual practice, this is not a multiband graphic EQ. Instead, it’s a four-band semi-parametric EQ with knobs rather than sliders, plus a high-pass and low-pass filter. The EQ is said to “balance the naturally full low end of [Mayer’s] amplifiers.”

There are effects pedals here, too—five are up front, before the amps. You get a volume boost pedal meant especially to thicken the tone of single-coil pickups like those found on Fender Stratocasters or PRS Silver Sky guitars (which Mayer also helped design). Then you get an “antelope filter” that provides a sort of auto-wah effect; usually, I hate these sorts of things, but this one sounds good enough that I could see myself using it on lead lines without feeling like I’m some kind of ’70s funk refugee.

After that come two drive pedals that are modeled on the Klon Centaur, the Ibanez TS-10, and the Marshall Bluesbreaker MK1. That’s right: You get three effects units jammed into two virtual pedals, because one of the pedals has a toggle switch to offer two different tones.

Finally, there’s a bucket brigade delay meant largely for slapback echoes, while a separate post-amp effects section offers more traditional delay and reverb (both hall and plate) for space.

While you won’t find this exact gear and these exact settings elsewhere, several of the amp simulation suites mentioned at the top of this piece provide plenty of “ballpark” options. (Paradise Guitar Studio, for instance, also models a Klon Centaur pedal and offers boost pedals and even more overdrive pedal options, along with spring reverb and bucket brigade delays.)

Whether you need (or “need”) Mayer X depends on just what other gear you have and what kind of tone you’re chasing. To me, the presets in Mayer X sound just slightly more modern than Paradise Guitar Studio, which especially emphasizes “classic” rock sounds from the ’60s to the ’90s. And Mayer X offers so many more amps and effects than Neural DSP’s Tone King, which I previously used for some of these sorts of sounds.

One of the best things about this package is that it is not “hyped” to sound over the top in standalone guitar demos, which is why its sounds fit so well into mixes. Reverb, delay, tremolo, boost, and drive are subtle and judicious, as is compression. Nearly everything is usable if you play anywhere in the pop/blues/rock/funk landscape. Even effects like freeze delay and the antelope filter—two types of effects that generally feel irrelevant or gimmicky to me—here inspire actual creativity. This is my personal taste talking—yours may differ—but the entire Mayer X package offers tone colors I would actually use in projects rather than garish neons that sound “impressive” but are unlikely to work as-is in any given song.

So if you’re looking for Mayer’s brand of smooth-but-full blues-inspired leads or his edge of breakup rhythm tones, John Mayer X is certainly a good way to get it in one package. This doesn’t feel like a cash-in, either; the quality and variety is immediately apparent, especially in new or custom bits like the boost pedal, the antelope filter, the Gravity Tank, and the “three-in-one” amp.

Just to see what I could do with almost no tweaking, I played around with presets for a couple of hours and came up with this short demo that features rhythm, double-tracked rhythm, filtered, overdriven rhythm, and delayed lead sounds. I even laid down a little bass (Mayer X does include a few bass-specific presets to get you started). To me, everything works well right out of the box, and the sounds blend well with each other (and with bass/drum tracks) in the mix, something not always true of presets. A little EQ and some mild master bus processing, and I ended up with the demo below:

Redditors who have played with the plugin so far seem impressed. “Absolutely blown away. Every single amp, mic, cab and pedal option is usable and sounds amazing,” wrote one.

“I’m a mostly clean-to-slight-crunch player, and this is by FAR the most plug-in-and-get-great-sounds-out-of-it NDSP plugin for that style that I’ve tried,” wrote another.

But they also echo my chief complaint. The downside of all these guitar sim plugins is that they are getting increasingly expensive. Universal Audio’s recent Paradise Guitar Studio claims a full price of $199 (I say “claims” because most of the company’s products are on sale most of the time). John Mayer X is going for €169 + tax in the US ($198 at current currency rates), and even more in Europe, while Neural DSP’s previous Archetype, the Misha Mansoor X, is only €125 ($146). Perhaps in this Archetype, the “X” stands for “expensive”?

That’s a lot of scratch for a plugin, though of course this one models gear worth many thousands of dollars and is far cheaper than buying modeling hardware like Neural DSP’s own Quad Cortex. (Those inclined to wait may be able to pick up Mayer X during one of Neural DSP’s biannual sales, often at 50 percent off.) And this one certainly sounds great.

If you’re one of those who suffer from gear acquisition syndrome (GAS), potent in both its physical and digital forms, these $150–$200 plugins add up quickly. Buy four or five and you’re into some real money! So if you already have other clean to mid-gain amp sims that work well for you, wisdom might suggest making your peace with what you have rather than looking for incremental improvements every time a new plugin appears. (There’s always a 14-day trial if you want to test Mayer X first.)

But if you’re newer to the amp sim market or have money to blow on your hobby or just love Mayer’s tones, Mayer X is certainly a wonderful place to start. Will you sound like Mayer? Probably not, given how much “tone” actually resides in the fingers, but you will get a great creative toolkit for bringing out the best in your own sound.

The real takeaway here is that technology has made it an amazing time to be a guitar player. We’re blessed for choices, and those choices get better every day.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/nasa-will-soon-find-out-if-the-perseverance-rover-can-really-persevere-on-mars/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the Perseverance rover arrived on Mars nearly five years ago, NASA officials thought the next American lander to take aim on the red planet would be taking shape by now.

At the time, the leaders of the space agency expected this next lander could be ready for launch as soon as 2026—or more likely in 2028. Its mission would have been to retrieve Martian rock specimens collected by the Perseverance rover, then billed as the first leg of a multilaunch, multibillion-dollar Mars Sample Return campaign.

Here we are on the verge of 2026, and there’s no sample retrieval mission nearing the launch pad. In fact, no one is building such a lander at all. NASA’s strategy for a Mars Sample Return, or MSR, mission remains undecided after the projected cost of the original plan ballooned to $11 billion. If MSR happens at all, it’s now unlikely to launch until the 2030s.

That means the Perseverance rover, which might have to hand off the samples to a future retrieval lander in some circumstances, must continue weathering the harsh, cold, dusty environment of Mars. The good news is that the robot, about the size of a small SUV, is in excellent health, according to Steve Lee, Perseverance’s deputy project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

“Perseverance is approaching five years of exploration on Mars,” Lee said in a press briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union’s annual fall meeting. “Perseverance is really in excellent shape. All the systems onboard are operational and performing very, very well. All the redundant systems onboard are available still, and the rover is capable of supporting this mission for many, many years to come.”

The rover’s operators at JPL are counting on sustaining Perseverance’s good health. The rover’s six wheels have carried it a distance of about 25 miles, or 40 kilometers, since landing inside the 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer) Jezero Crater in February 2021. That is double the original certification for the rover’s mobility system and farther than any vehicle has traveled on the surface of another world.

Now, engineers are asking Perseverance to perform well beyond expectations. An evaluation of the rover’s health concluded it can operate until at least 2031. The rover uses a radioactive plutonium power source, so it’s not in danger of running out of electricity or fuel any time soon. The Curiosity rover, which uses a similar design, has surpassed 13 years of operations on Mars.

There are two systems that are most likely to limit the rover’s useful lifetime. One is the robotic arm, which is necessary to collect samples, and the other is the rover’s six wheels and the drive train that powers them.

“To make sure we can continue operations and continue driving for a long, long way, up to 100 kilometers (62 miles), we are doing some additional testing,” Lee said. “We’ve successfully completed a rotary actuator life test that has now certified the rotary system to 100 kilometers for driving, and we have similar testing going on for the brakes. That is going well, and we should finish those early part of next year.”

Ars asked Lee why JPL decided on 100 kilometers, which is roughly the same distance as the average width of Lake Michigan. Since its arrival in 2021, Perseverance has climbed out of Jezero Crater and is currently exploring the crater’s rugged rim. If NASA sends a lander to pick up samples from Perseverance, the rover will have to drive back to a safe landing zone for a handoff.

“We actually had laid out a traverse path exploring the crater rim, much more of the crater rim than we have so far, and then be able to return to a rendezvous site,” Lee said. “So we did an estimate of the total mission drive duration to complete that mission, added margin for science exploration, added margin in case we need the rendezvous at a different site… and it just turned out to add up to a nice, even 100 kilometers.”

The time-lapse video embedded below shows the Perseverance rover’s record-breaking 1,351-foot (412-meter) drive on June 19, 2025.

Despite the disquiet on the future of MSR, the Perseverance rover has dutifully collected specimens and placed them in 33 titanium sample tubes since arriving on Mars. Perseverance deposited some of the sealed tubes on the surface of Mars in late 2022 and early 2023 and has held onto the remaining containers while continuing to drive toward the rim of Jezero.

The dual-depot approach preserves the option for future MSR mission planners to go after either batch of samples.

Scientists selected Jezero as the target for the Perseverance mission because they suspected it was the site of an ancient dried-up river delta with a surplus of clay-rich minerals. The rover’s instruments confirmed this hypothesis, finding sediments in the crater floor that were deposited at the bottom of a lake of liquid water billions of years ago, including sandstones and mudstones known to preserve fossilized life in comparable environments on Earth.

A research team published findings in the journal Nature in September describing the discovery of chemical signatures and structures in a rock that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. Perseverance lacks the bulky, sprawling instrumentation to know for sure, so ground teams ordered the rover to collect a pulverized specimen from the rock in question and seal it for eventual return to Earth.

Lee said Perseverance will continue filling sample tubes in the expectation that they will eventually come back to Earth.

“We do expect to continue some sampling,” Lee said. “We have six open sample tubes, unused sample tubes, onboard. We actually have two that we took samples and didn’t seal yet. So we have options of maybe replacing them if we’re finding that there’s even better areas that we want to collect from.”

The rover’s management team at JPL is finalizing the plan for Perseverance through 2028. Lee expects the rover will remain at Jezero’s rim for a while. “There are quite a number of very prime, juicy targets we would love to go explore,” he said.

In the meantime, if Perseverance runs across an alluring rock, scientists will break out the rover’s coring drill and fill more tubes.

“We certainly have more than enough to keep us busy, and we are not expecting a major perturbation to our science explorations in the next two and a half years as a result of sample return uncertainty,” Lee said.

Perseverance has its own suite of sophisticated instruments. The instruments can’t do what labs on Earth can, but the rover can scan rocks to determine what they’re made of, search for life-supporting organic molecules, map underground geology, and capture startling vistas that inspire and inform.

The rover’s sojourn along the Jezero Crater rim is taking it through different geological eras, from the time Jezero harbored a lake to its formation at an even earlier point in Martian history. Fundamentally, researchers are asking the question “What was it like if you were a microbe living on the surface of Mars?” said Briony Horgan, a mission scientist at Purdue University.

Along the way, the rover will stop and do a sample collection if something piques the science team’s interest.

“We are adopting a strategy, in many cases, to fill a tube, and we have the option to not seal it,” Lee said. “Most of our tubes are sealed, but we have the option to not seal it, and that gives us a flexibility downstream to replace the sample if there’s one that we find would make an even stronger representative of the diversity we are discovering.”

Planetary scientists have carefully curated the specimens cached by the Perseverance rover. The samples are sorted for their discovery potential, with an emphasis on the search for ancient microbial life. That’s why Perseverance was sent to Jezero in the first place.

China is preparing its own sample-return mission, Tianwen-3, for launch as early as 2028, aiming to deliver Mars rocks back to Earth by 2031. If the Tianwen-3 mission keeps to this schedule—and is successful—China will almost certainly be first to pull off the achievement. Officials have not announced the landing site for Tianwen-3, so the jury is still out on the scientific value of the rocks China aims to bring back.

NASA’s original costly architecture for Mars Sample Return would have used a lander built by JPL and a small solid-fueled rocket to launch the rock samples back into space after collecting them from the Perseverance rover. The capsule containing the Mars rocks would then transfer them to another spacecraft in orbit around Mars. Once Earth and Mars reached the proper orbital alignment, the return spacecraft would begin the journey home. All told, the sample return campaign would last several years.

NASA asked commercial companies to develop their own ideas for Mars Sample Return in 2024. SpaceX, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Rocket Lab submitted their lower-cost commercial concepts to NASA, but progress stalled there. NASA’s former administrator, Bill Nelson, punted on a decision on what to do next with Mars Sample Return in the final weeks of the Biden administration.

A few months later, the new Trump administration proposed outright canceling the Mars Sample Return mission. Mars Sample Return, known as MSR, was ranked as the top priority for planetary science in a National Academies decadal survey. Researchers say they could learn much more about Mars and the possibilities of past life there by bringing samples back to Earth for analysis.

Budget writers in the House of Representatives voted to restore funding for Mars Sample Return over the summer, but the Senate didn’t explicitly weigh in on the mission. NASA is now operating under a stopgap budget passed by Congress last month, and MSR remains in limbo.

There are good arguments for going with a commercial sample-return mission, using a similar approach to the one NASA used to buy commercial cargo and crew transportation services for the International Space Station. NASA might also offer prizes or decide to wait for a human expedition to Mars for astronauts to scoop up samples by hand.

Eric Berger, senior space editor at Ars, discussed these options a few months ago. After nearly a year of revolving-door leadership, NASA finally got a Senate-confirmed administrator this week. It will now be up to the new NASA chief, Jared Isaacman, to chart a new course for Mars Sample Return.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The holidays have snuck up on us. How is it already that time?

If you’re on top of things and have already bought all your Christmas gifts, I commend you. Not all of us are so conscientious. In fact, one of us is so behind on holiday prep that he is not only running late on buying gifts; he’s also behind on publishing the Ars staff gift guide he said he’d write. (Whoever could we be talking about?)

So for my fellow last-minute scramblers, I polled Ars writers and editors for gift ideas they know will be solid because they’ve actually used them. As such, you’ll find gift options below that Ars staffers have used enough to feel good about recommending. Further, I made sure all of these are available for delivery before Christmas as of today, at least where I live.

For each gadget (or whatever else it might be), we have a brief description of how or why we’ve been using this particular thing and why we would recommend it. Note that the prices we’ve listed here represent where they were at the time this article was written, but online retailers often vary prices based on different factors, so you might see something different when you click through.

Ars Commentariat: If you feel inclined, feel free to share some other ideas. I genuinely might take advantage if you share something good.

Somehow, amazingly, we are still living in a split USB-C/USB-A world all these years later. No one’s thrilled about it, but there’s no end in sight. Some folks in the Apple ecosystem turn to Apple’s first-party adapters, but there are two problems with them in my view: first, they’re weirdly expensive, as you’d expect. And second, they’re larger than they need to be.

I have about a dozen of these little adapters sitting around my house. The only downside is that because they’re shorter, they’re thicker, so you can’t always put two right next to each other in the MacBook Pro’s USB-C ports. But in the aforementioned mixed-use quagmire we all now occupy, odds are good you can just put it next to something that actually uses a USB-C connection. If you’re like me, you’re at about 2/3 USB-C and 1/3 USB-A at this point.

There are a bunch of brands for these, but they’re all pretty interchangeable, and I’ve not had any problems with these in particular.

People often debate whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie. (I definitely think it is.) But there’s another movie I often watch during the holidays: John Carpenter’s The Thing. I’ll freely admit it’s not holiday-themed in any way, but it’s at least filled with snow and winter gloom!

I don’t buy every movie on physical media—I’ve accepted that a lot of my library is going to be on Apple’s TV app or coming and going on streaming services—but I try to collect the lifelong favorites to make sure I’ll still have them decades down the road. (As long as they keep making Blu-ray players, anyway, which unfortunately is starting to look as uncertain as whether a favorite film stays on Netflix.)

For me, The Thing definitely qualifies as a favorite that’s worth holding onto for years to come.

Acer USB C Hub, 7 in 1 Multi-Port Adapter – $18

Modern laptops with only two USB-C ports basically require a hub. This Acer turns one port into HDMI (4K@30Hz), two USB-A ports for legacy gear, SD/microSD slots, and 100 W passthrough charging. At $18, I keep one in my bag and one on my desk. It’s not fancy, but it earns its keep the first time you need to dump a memory card or plug into a TV set.

Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans by Melanie Mitchell – $20

Originally published in 2019, it’s an amazing testament to how strong this book is that even after all that’s happened, the 2025 reissue doesn’t change much. Melanie Mitchell, a professor of computer science at Portland State University and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute, nails this historical summary of how we got to this point through multiple AI springs and AI winters.

She carefully explains the concepts and research underpinnings of contemporary developments in machine learning, large language models, image generation, and so on, while amplifying key voices from several of the people who contributed to progress in this field—both doomsayers and boosters alike—with a technically rigorous and ethically informed point of view.

If you or someone you know is just getting started learning about AI as we know it today, there are a lot of books they could read, and some of them are surely more contemporary. But I can hardly think of any that make a better foundation.

Every self-respecting geek should own a soldering iron. Even if you aren’t making your own PCBs or recapping old electronics, it’s the kind of thing that just comes in handy. Especially around the holidays, when people are getting out their old battery-powered decorations that come with a lot of memories, wear, and flaky power terminals. Be the hero that brings a treasured light-up keepsake back to life!

When you don’t need a full-on soldering station, though, it’s nice to have something compact and easy to slip in a drawer. Enter the Pinecil, conveniently powered over USB-C, with a slick little screen allowing for easy temperature control (in F or C) and firmware that auto-sleeps if you forget to unplug it.

Anker 67 watt USB charger and Anker USB-C silicon power cable – $25 and $16

If you already have a suitable USB-C power supply (you really want at least 60 watts) and a USB-C cable, you’re set. If not, this power supply from Anker—a reliable brand, in my experience—is compact and folds up for easy storage. Not all USB-C cables are up to the task of transmitting the magic wall juice, so if you’re not sure you have an appropriate one, pick up the above cable, which is sheathed in silicon to keep it nice and floppy so you’re not wrestling with a stiff cord while using your iron.

While a lot of my road bike’s miles are spent on actual roads, it’s hard to do any long rides in my area without spending a little time on a cycle trail—one shared by pedestrians, runners, scooter riders, casual cyclists, and random others. Even if the rules of most of those trails didn’t specify using a bell, it’s a smart idea to have one—especially one that’s loud enough to cut through whatever’s coming out of the headphones that most people wear.

But real estate on my handlebars is limited. They already host a cycling computer and a light, and two cables and two hydraulic tubes snake their way through the area, emerging from under the handlebar tape before diving into the frame. Finding a bell that both works and keeps out of the way turned into a bit of a challenge. And then a solution presented itself: A company called Knog sent me an email about their bell offerings.

All of Knog’s options are mechanically simple—just a half circle of metal that follows the circumference of the handlebar and a spring-loaded hammer to strike it—and loud enough to catch even headphone wearers’ attention. They’re also low-profile, barely sticking out from the handlebars themselves, and they’re narrow enough that it was easy to find space for one without bumping it into any of the cabling. It’s all unobtrusive enough that I forget mine’s there until I need it. Yes, you can find lots of cheaper alternative designs (the Knogs run between $20 and $45), but for me, it’s worth paying an extra $10–$15 for something that suits my needs this well.

This is the mouse I’m using right now as I type this. I wanted a mouse that could cross basically every domain: It needed to be good enough for gaming, but conveniently wireless, while also working well across macOS, Windows, and Linux—and it needed to be portable and not too embarrassing in a professional context because I fly to far-flung cities for work at least a dozen times a year. Razer’s Orochi met all of those goals, and I appreciate that it looks neat and professional, despite the fact that it’s very much a gamer mouse.

The only area where it fumbles is that Razer’s app seems to crash and cause problems for me on both macOS and Windows, but it works just fine without the app, so I uninstalled it, and everything’s been golden since. (To be clear, you don’t need to install it to use the mouse.)

It wins points for versatility; I don’t think it really compromises anything across all the situations I mentioned.

As of this writing, it’s on sale for $34, but the typical price is $70—still not bad for what you’re getting.

I set up a home studio this year to record my righteous jams, and as part of that process, I needed an external SSD both to back up project files and to hold many hundreds of gigs of virtual instruments. I wanted something 1) blazingly fast, 2) good-looking, 3) bus-powered, 4) free of all (and all too common) sleep/wake glitches, 5) unlikely to burst into flames (these things can get hot), and yet also 6) completely fanless because my righteous jams would be far less righteous with a fan droning in the background.

Those criteria led me to OWC’s Express 1M2, an SSD enclosure that transfers data at 40Gb/s over USB 4, matches the look of my Mac mini perfectly (and works with PCs), and is bus-powered. It has never given me a sleep/wake problem; it gets warm but never palm-searingly hot, and it dissipates heat through a chonky, milled-aluminum case that requires no fan.

I love this thing. It was ludicrously easy to install my own NVMe M.2 drive in it (though you can also pay a small premium for pre-installed storage). I’ve never had a moment of trouble—nor have I ever heard it. Yes, the enclosure costs more than some other options, but it’s a well-made piece of kit that can transfer data nearly as fast as my Mac’s internal SSD and should last for years. If someone in your life needs an SSD enclosure, they could do far, far worse than the Express 1M2.

It’s been about a year since I switched full-time to Kagi for my search engine needs, leaving Google behind in a cloud of dust and not looking back, and it was the correct choice, at least for me. Kagi’s upsides are many—including and especially search that works how it’s supposed to work instead of by fabricating garbage or tricking you into buying things—but the big downside is that while Kagi has a free tier, real daily usage requires money.

But if you’re a happy Kagi user like me and you want to tempt others into using the service, Kagi has gift subscriptions! If you’ve been trying to tempt a friend or relative into abandoning Google’s sinking AI ship but they’re balking at the price, throw some money at that problem and knock that barrier down! A “pro” Kagi subscription with unlimited search costs about a hundred dollars a year, and while that obviously isn’t nothing, it’s also not an unfair price—especially for something I use every day. Kagi: It’s what’s for Christmas!

Unlike Kagi, I’ve been using Philips Hue lights for a long, long time—13 years and counting, and most of those old first-gen bulbs are still operational. But the bridge, the Hue component that actually connects to your LAN, has long had an annoying problem: It can hook up to a max of about 50 Hue bulbs, and that’s it. (The reason has to do with cost-saving choices Philips made on the bridge design.)

Thirteen years has been enough for me to accumulate at least 50 Hue devices, so this limit has been problematic for me—but it’s a problem no more! After a decade and change, Philips has finally released an updated “Pro” bridge that handles far more Hue devices—and it comes in stylish black! The new bridge brings some new capabilities, too, but the big news is that new device limit—something long-time customers like me have spent years pining for. Now I can festoon my house with even more automatic lights!

The Logitech MX Master 3S and the newer MX Master 4 remain two of the best productivity mice on the market. Both use an 8,000-DPI Darkfield sensor, the excellent MagSpeed electromagnetic scroll wheel, and Logitech’s deep customization stack. The 3S has been our long-standing recommendation, but the MX Master 4 brings a few quality-of-life improvements that may justify the upgrade. Most notably, it replaces the 3S’s soft-touch palm coating, which wears quickly and tends to attract grime, with more durable textured materials. The redesigned switches also make the 4 one of the quietest mice you can buy, with muted clicks and a near-silent scroll wheel.

The more ambitious addition is the new haptic system, meant to provide tactile feedback for shortcut triggers and app-specific “Actions Ring” menus. In practice, though, software support remains thin. Productivity apps haven’t yet embraced haptic signaling, and months after launch, the plugin ecosystem is still limited. The MX Master 4 is a well-executed refinement, but its headline feature is waiting for the software world to catch up.

The Ray-Ban Meta glasses may look bulkier than a standard pair of Wayfarers, but the added hardware delivers a genuinely interesting glimpse at where mobile computing is headed. After spending time with them, it’s clear that eyewear will likely follow the same trajectory as smartwatches: once niche, now a viable surface for ambient computing. The multimodal AI features are impressive, and the built-in camera produces better-than-expected 1080p/30fps video, though low-light performance remains limited by the small sensor.

These are still early-stage devices with the usual growing pains, but they’re a compelling gift for early adopters who want a front-row seat to the future of wearable interfaces.

As I once again attempted to make the Sophie’s Choice of which Steam game to uninstall because I ran out of disk space, I realized that part of my problem is that I have two computers (a macOS laptop and a Windows desktop) and I’ve doubled up on storing certain things—like the absolutely enormous eXoDOS collection, for example—on both machines so I could access them regardless of where I was at.

The best thing I could do to help my constant space woes was to consolidate anything that I needed on both machines into an external drive I could share between them. I went with Samsung’s T9 external SSD, and so far, I’m happy with it. As planned, I now have a lot more breathing room on both computers.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You don’t share the road with robotaxis — the robotaxis munificently share the road with you.

This week, one of Waymo’s fully driverless cabs was spotted blundering down the wrong side of a street in Austin, Texas, causing the human motorists driving in the correct direction to cautiously come to a halt, not unlike hikers encountering a bear.

The incident was captured in footage uploaded to Reddit. For a split second, it shows the Waymo flash its emergency signal, before switching to its turn signal. The robotaxi then turns in the opposite direction indicated by its blinker and pulls into a gas station, taking its sweet time.

“Just another day in Austin,” the uploader wrote in the caption.

Local news site My San Antonio reports that the incident took place on a stretch of frontage road next to the Interstate 35 highway in downtown Austin.

It’s another example of robotaxis acting with the kind of impunity to traffic laws you might expect from someone playing Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it’s not even the first time they’ve been caught driving on the wrong side of the road. Waymo may boast an impressive safety record, but its driverless cabs can still go off the rails in ways that can be comical, baffling, or genuinely dangerous.

This month, for example, Waymo recalled a software patch after its robotaxis were caught blowing past stopped school buses with active warning lights and stop signs, including at least one incident where a Waymo drove right by students who were disembarking. Twenty of these incidents were reported in Austin alone, MySA noted, prompting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation into the company.

It’s not just school buses: the cabs don’t always stop for law enforcement, either. Earlier this month, a Waymo careened into an active police standoff, driving just a few feet away from a suspect who was lying facedown in the asphalt while cops had their guns trained on him.

In San Francisco, Waymo sparked outrage in the community after one of its robotaxis killed a beloved bodega cat known to locals as Kit Kat. Another ran over a dog that witnesses say was playing in the street.

These come as Waymo has been updating its cars’ software to drive more aggressively like a human motorist.

“Safety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and with whom we share the streets,” a spokesperson told MySA in a statement. “We take situations like this seriously and are committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience.”

            <div id="article-text">While some anti-AI advocates have called for some extreme property damage to halt the AI boom, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has a proposition that’s a little more down to Earth: simply shut it all down until we can figure out what the hell is going on.

In a video shared on social media, Sanders announced he’ll be pushing for a “moratorium on the construction of data centers that are powering the unregulated sprint to develop and deploy AI.”

His main contention is that society needs to slow down on the rapid deployment of new tech, and ask an important question: who benefits?

“Let us be clear: AI and robotics are the most transformative technologies in the history of humanity,” Sanders declares. “Just a few points we need to think about: one, who is aggressively pushing these technologies? Well, surprise, surprise, it happens to be the very wealthiest people on Earth.”

Sanders’ call comes at a time when AI-related capital expenditures account for around half of the US GDP growth throughout the year, as low-income Americans’ purchasing power plummets and vehicle repossessions hit levels equivalent to the Great Recession.

“Do you believe that these guys, these multibillionaires, are staying up nights worrying about what AI and robotics will do for the working families of our country, and the world?” Sanders continues. “I don’t think so. I think that these very, very, rich men want even more wealth, and even more power. “

“Question: if AI and robotics eliminate millions of jobs and create massive unemployment, how will people survive if they have no income?” the Vermont Senator challenges. “Very few members of Congress are seriously thinking about this.”

Sanders goes on to cite the growing degree of emotional dependence users are developing on AI chatbots, as well as the selfish ambitions of billionaires like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Dario Amodei.

“One thing’s for sure: this process is moving very, very, quickly, and we need to slow it down,” Sanders said. “This moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up with these transformative changes that we are witnessing, and make sure that the benefits of these technologies work for all of us, not just the wealthiest people one Earth.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump’s failing social media tech bid has tirelessly tried to reinvent itself into a viable business.

But despite forays into cryptocurrency, prediction markets, and a Roku streaming app that few have heard of, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is still losing a staggering amount of money.

The company, which owns Trump’s online megaphone Truth Social and is being run by his eldest son Donald Trump Jr., reported a quarterly loss of $54.8 million at the end of September.

Now, in its latest eyebrow-raising pivot, the company announced this week that it’s merging with the fusion power company TAE, formerly called Tri Alpha Energy.

It’s yet another peculiar detour for the troubled and massively unprofitable company, which started as a comparatively simple competitor to Twitter after it permanently suspended Trump from its platform in 2021. The firm subsequently merged with a blank-check acquisition company in March 2024, allowing it to be publicly traded.

The fusion news was met with plenty of investor enthusiasm, sending the company’s stock — under the ticker DJT — soaring by over 35 percent at the time of writing.

The company’s latest business foray is a serious long shot. Despite decades of research — and enormous interest from the private sector — scientists are only beginning to crack the point where highly complex fusion reactors, designed to harness the energy of fusing atoms, can generate more energy than they require to operate.

While it’s already being lauded as a technological revolution by many, promising an infinite source of clean and safe energy, plenty of questions remain about the tech’s feasibility, particularly when it comes to scaling up operations.

In today’s announcement, TMTG claimed that TAE has “significantly reduced fusion reactor size, cost, and complexity” and “built and safely operated five fusion reactors and raised more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date,” from heavyweights like Google, Chevron, and Goldman Sachs.

TMTG’s announcement could also put Trump at odds with a growing number of competitors in an increasingly busy space. For instance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made considerable investments in a nuclear fusion startup called Helion. Amazon cofounder Jeff Bezos is also funneling money into fusion energy companies.

Billionaire Elon Musk, however, is not interested, calling it an outright stupid idea. In a tweet posted just days before TMTG announced the TAE deal, Musk — who’s feuded bitterly with Trump in an on-again-off-again friendship — argued that the “Sun is an enormous, free fusion reactor in the sky.”

“It is super dumb to make tiny fusion reactors on Earth,” he added. “Stop wasting money on puny little reactors, unless actively acknowledging that they are just there for your pet science project jfc.”

TMTG’s leadership, however, are adamant that it’s a sound idea.

“Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,” CEO Devin Nunes said in the announcement.

Nunes also implied that investing in fusion now could benefit from the enormous amount of interest in artificial intelligence.

“Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense, and secure the energy needed to guarantee America’s dominance of AI technology,’ he The timing of the announcement is certainly intriguing. Mere days ago, Nuno Loureiro, a lauded theoretical physicist and director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was murdered in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/instacart-to-pay-60m-to-settle-ftc-claims-it-deceived-consumers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instacart will pay $60 million in refunds to settle allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it deceived consumers with false advertising. The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s ‘free delivery’ claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.

The agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies  it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.

Additionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.

Instacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.

“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,”  said Christopher Mufarrige, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.

Instacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”

The settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.

            <div id="article-text">App developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within Chat’s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an “app store.”

In October, the company announced the arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities to ChatGPT users. Major platforms—including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva—announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.

“Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday.

OpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added.

This is a big step for OpenAI towards expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it.

            <div id="article-text">Pickle Robot, which builds autonomous unloading robots for warehouses and distribution centers, announced a new chief financial officer just days after a report of a major deal with UPS.

The Charlestown, Massachusetts-based company announced that it hired Jeff Evanson as its CFO on Thursday. Evanson had been consulting for the company since September and recently joined full time.

Evanson previously served as the vice president of global investor relations and strategy at Tesla from 2011 to 2017. In that role, he worked directly with Elon Musk and helped the company raise debt and equity financing to support the launch of multiple Tesla vehicle lines and company acquisitions.

Evanson will be Pickle’s first CFO and joins as the company — founded in 2018 with around $100 million in venture capital raised — reportedly expands its partnership with shipping giant UPS. According to Bloomberg, UPS is investing $120 million to purchase 400 of Pickle’s robots, with deployment beginning in late 2026 and early 2027.

Pickle declined to comment on this week’s UPS news. A Pickle spokesperson did confirm that UPS has been a Pickle customer for a few years but wouldn’t confirm when the partnership started.

On his 70th birthday, in 1905, Mark Twain gave a speech about the secret to successful aging. (If 70 doesn’t sound aged to you, bear in mind that because of high infant-mortality rates, the average life expectancy for someone born before 1850 was less than 40.) “I have achieved my 70 years in the usual way,” he declared, according to an account in The New York Times, “by sticking strictly to a scheme of life which would kill anybody else.” The maxim he offered was this: “We can’t reach old age by another man’s road.”

Typical for Twain, this was solid folk wisdom wrapped in a joke. The secret to a long and happy life is clearly not smoking, drinking, and carousing. But he’s correct that there is no plug-and-play formula that works for everyone. Within obvious parameters, each of us should experiment with different ideas and specific ways of living, a proposition I have previously discussed. Some people are at their healthiest on a vegetarian diet; others will be so by eating Mediterranean. Some are happiest living in a big metropolis such as New York City and Los Angeles; others are living their best life out in the country.

These details aside, however, a few general habits do matter. I won’t detain you with the health-and-wellness stuff that you might hear from your doctor: Lay off the smokes and go for a walk, for God’s sake. I want instead to call your attention to certain patterns of behavior that are not so obvious but that help explain why old people tend to be happier than young adults. The sooner you can learn and adopt these rules for good living, the sooner you can enjoy their fruits.

No question, you will come across some grouchy, unhappy old people, but on average in the United States, older adults score significantly higher in well-being than younger adults. Older people experience lower psychological distress and negative affect, and more frequent positive affect. I have also written before about how older folks tend to enjoy positive changes to their personality: agreeableness and conscientiousness rise as we age; neuroticism falls. What explains this pattern is not immediately apparent. Without a doubt, acquired wisdom plays a role: Older people have more life data and make fewer errors. But three particular patterns of behavior that old people display do matter a great deal.

Arthur C. Brooks: How to be happy growing older

The first involves social networks. Early in life, you were probably encouraged to develop a wide range of friendships with different kinds of people, for the sake of your happiness. This was good advice insofar as you learned new ways of thinking and living from people outside your typical social circles. But it doesn’t mean that you need to expend special effort maintaining links with lots of people with whom you have superficial ties. This would just fill your free time with unrewarding interactions. Yet precisely this sort of broad but thin acquaintance characterizes the networks of many young adults. Older people selectively narrow their social circles to focus on the individuals with whom they share common passions, experience positive emotions, and derive satisfaction. The casual associates who don’t make the cut are left behind.

This might sound selfish, but people actually become more altruistic as they age—the second pattern of behavior that raises older people’s happiness compared with that of young people. In a 2021 survey of research on self-reported altruism and observed charitable behavior, four psychologists found that 14 of the 16 studies they reviewed revealed that older adults are more focused on others than younger ones. In one especially ingenious demonstration of this finding, researchers asked adults of differing ages to clasp a handheld grip-strength device called a dynamometer and squeeze it with a high level of effort in order to obtain rewards for themselves or others. Younger adults gripped harder than older adults for self-rewards; older adults gripped harder than the younger adults to gain rewards for others.

The third pattern involves how older people react to difficult events in life. As a person ages, they usually get better at both avoiding and dealing with life stress. One 2023 longitudinal study involving nearly 3,000 adults ages 25 to 74 found that 70-year-olds felt stress on 40 percent fewer days than 25-year-olds did. Part of this is because the elders exposed themselves less to stressful events, but it is also because they were less reactive to stressful situations. Some of this is surely down to life circumstances: Retired 70-somethings no longer have demanding jobs. But another factor is that when old people encounter a stressful situation, they tend simply to shrug it off. Whether to respond to a challenging event might not seem voluntary, but in fact, it can be—and when the stress is unavoidable, the elderly simply react less by caring less.

As I was writing this essay, one experience came to mind that reinforced the points above, involving a two-day meeting that I’d attended in Rome some 25 years ago for a large international charity. The conference convened a small group of well-being specialists —some very junior (as I was at the time), some much older and more famous. Among the latter was a 60-year-old woman of global stature in the field. Feeling honored to be in her company, I paid close attention to her behavior. At the time, it seemed a bit strange; now it does not.

She had flown long haul through the night to attend the meeting, without compensation, and participated fully in every session. But when it came to the lavish dinner party held on the last night of the conference—which to me was a great perk—she walked into the bistro and declared, “This place is too loud” and left. This remarkable woman was exhibiting all three happiness patterns: She was spending time professionally with people who shared her passion for a cause, she was making a personal effort and donating her considerable expertise, and she was saying no to something that wasn’t worth the stress and sacrifice for her.

At 36, I was amazed that she’d pass on the party. Today, at 61, I follow her example: I will go to considerable personal effort to serve causes that I care about, and I will discuss matters of spiritual depth or scientific importance for hours on end. But small talk in a noisy bar? No chance.

So what follows are three general rules I learned from older people that lead to higher well-being.

1. Go deep or go home. I try to ensure that my social relationships—those that are voluntary and involve discretionary time—focus only on facets of life that matter: love, faith, philosophy, virtue, culture, aesthetics. I don’t want to talk about my beach vacation, or yours, unless a major epiphany occurred as the tide came in.

2. Serve more. A unique channel of well-being is serving others in causes I care about. This can mean giving money and time, of course. But it also entails regularly subjecting my work to a “values test”: Does each activity primarily edify and uplift others?

Read: Life for 30-somethings is getting more stressful

3. Care less. I think back to the things that kept me awake as a younger man—this conflict at work, that worry about money—and shake my head. Now when something is bothering me or threatens to stress me out, I ask myself whether the issue is likely to be bothering me in a week’s time. If the answer is no, I try to get a head start right then on not caring.

True to his craft as a satirist, Twain preferred to mock the whole business of elders dispensing counsel to youngsters, as he did in his 1882 essay “Advice to Youth”: “If a person offend you, and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick.”

I strongly suspect, however, that Twain followed better rules than this by the time he was 70. Closing his birthday remarks, the old riverboat pilot said that he had laid a course “toward the sinking sun with a contented heart”—no doubt by following the happy (if not quite so funny) principles above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The cartoonist and journalist Joe Sacco has made a career of rescuing history from the cleavages of memory. One set of scenes in his 2009 book, Footnotes in Gaza, exemplifies this, revealing how testimony about painful events can diverge among witnesses, even within a family. Sacco speaks with an elderly woman named Omm Nafez, illustrating her story: She says that her husband and two of his brothers were shot by Israeli soldiers while walking out of the family home; a third brother, Khamis, jumped over a courtyard wall and survived. When Sacco finds Khamis, however, his account doesn’t entirely match Nafez’s. He recalls that his brothers were lined up in the courtyard and shot, killed not in a surprise scuffle but by premeditated execution. Khamis remembers visiting one of these brothers on his deathbed, but Nafez and another source say that Khamis was not there. So Sacco depicts both variations, while drawing out their disjunctions through commentary and supplementary reporting. The reader experiences these memories, and then questions them, and then at last sees the author’s process as he labors to tell the most honest-possible version of the truth.

Key word: see. Sacco reported Footnotes in Gaza from Khan Younis and Rafah, two cities at the south end of the Gaza Strip, over multiple trips in the aughts, and ultimately told a larger story—which stretches over decades of displacement and violence—in comic-strip panels. In this format, he is a character too, his round glasses and rabbit teeth peeking out amid the clustered limbs and busy tableaus. He’s used this approach to investigate catastrophes around the world, reporting from Chechnya, India, Iraq, Canada’s Northwest Territories, and the International Criminal Court. His work combines on-the-ground reportage with historical reconstruction, often stitched together from a patchwork of oral recollections.

In all of his coverage, Sacco places you inside the moment, dynamically re-creating not only how it looks but also how it feels. Despite his intense and difficult subject matter, his style reflects the unruly world of the underground comics in which he came of age. In his early, memoiristic Yahoo series, he employed an outlandish vernacular, influenced by R. Crumb and Art Spiegelman. And today Sacco’s drawings are still loose, dynamic, even a bit cartoonish—but he always senses when caricature should end and the facts should take over.

His newest book makes such fact-finding a key theme, demonstrating the instability of a political system grounded in untruth—and investigating how populist leaders can wield that for their own ends. The Once and Future Riot concerns a series of escalating clashes in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. In late August and early September of 2013, violence between Hindu Jats and Muslim villagers culminated in a full-scale assault against a third group: the landless Muslim laborers who lived and worked in Jat villages. It is now widely agreed that 62 people were killed, two-thirds of them Muslim, and 50,000 people, again mostly Muslim, were driven from their villages. But when Sacco arrived, more than a year later, details about who was responsible for the violence and who was harmed proved strikingly hard to pin down. He encountered something more potent than facts: “the fiction, the myth,” as he puts it, a set of competing (and politically convenient) narratives that are already taking the place of the historical event.

Traveling around Uttar Pradesh with the help of a local journalist, Piyush Kumar, he finds, and illustrates, plenty of physical evidence: torched houses, refugee camps, scarred and displaced victims. Based on witnesses’ recollections, he draws massive crowd scenes in which hundreds or even thousands of people converge and clash. To keep the reader from losing their way, he tiles these full-page panels with smaller inserts, revealing visually who is providing what testimony. But these stories quickly begin to contradict one another—and Sacco’s presentation of his interviewees’ faces and names takes on a second layer of meaning, showing how a journalistic reconstruction is pieced together from disparate sources, sometimes overlapping and sometimes conflicting, which illustrates handily that the story he is constructing is not the only one on offer.

Official accounts—from village chiefs, social leaders, and a district magistrate—differ based on who’s speaking and where. In Muslim villages, Sacco’s interviewees tell him that only women and children threw stones; among the Jats, the party line is that no Muslim laborers were killed, and everyone left peacefully on their own. Each of these stories works to suppress contrary evidence; all are deployed in service of what Sacco calls the “One True Story:” each village’s authority-sanctioned, broadly accepted narrative of their own communal innocence and their enemy’s communal guilt. There are those, like the Muslim refugees, who speak for themselves. But they are already outcasts, with no power, and no influence over any version, big or small.

Sacco traces the origins of the riot back to the murder of a Muslim boy by two Jats, who were then killed by a crowd in the village of Kawal. But all of these interactions were quickly imbued with a set, predetermined meaning. For many of the Jats interviewed by Sacco, a Muslim boy could not simply court a Hindu girl; he must be trying to seduce and despoil her, an act the Jats call “Love Jihad.” After the Jats called a mass meeting, known as a panchayat, some local Muslims armed themselves, perhaps believing that the Jats were planning a massacre on the scale of the 2002 Gujarat riots, during which more than 1,000 people died.

A year later, the displaced Muslim laborers are still living in tents, trapped between their persecutors and government officials who, Sacco suggests, wish to compensate only a handful of the victims. But the story of this disaster won’t be swept quietly onto the ash heap of history, as the author has learned across the world: For those living in conflict zones, “events are continuous,” an interviewee in Footnotes says.

Sacco knows better than most that political chauvinists of all kinds can point to past moments of injury and humiliation to justify any current cruelty or authoritarian project—an especially powerful appeal when those historical injustices are real. His Gazan interlocutors were speaking in the midst of the Second Intifada, when past atrocities were referenced by militants and politicians alike to justify new violence against civilians. In his 2000 book about the breakup of Yugoslavia, Safe Area Goražde, the Bosnian Serbs massacring their neighbors in the 1990s defended their crimes by appealing to similar killings carried out against ethnic Serbs during the Nazi-era fascist regime. The Once and Future Riot sees it happening again: Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalists rode the Uttar Pradesh riots to electoral victory, invoking very real suffering to excuse bellicose ethnic supremacism and the persecution of Muslim minorities.

Safe Area is one of Sacco’s best works because he takes the time to characterize the residents of Goražde, making visible what both propaganda and the fog of war tend to obscure. The book is full of harrowing, enraging war stories, but the main subjects are the people of Goražde, the remaining Bosniaks whose survival presents a firm rebuttal to their besiegers. The Serb ethno-nationalists he quotes seemingly can conceive of living and belonging only in the abstract, atavistic language of ethnicity and blood. But Sacco’s subjects don’t need to ruthlessly assert their right to their home; they belong in Goražde because they are already there. They share a love of pop music, The Bodyguard, and Levi’s 501s; they care more about the mundane facts of their love lives, their education, and their families than ancient feuds or religious rivalries. By focusing on the persistence of private life during wartime, the book widens from an investigation into a kind of communal portrait, literally illustrating the way injustice contorts and is resisted by people, together and alone.

Riot is more narrowly focused than that sweeping work; Sacco is searching for a story, and he eventually finds it, sometimes at the cost of the subject’s human dimensions. We get many perspectives on what happened before and after the panchayat, but “rather than provide a region-wide sampler of the violence visited on the Muslim peasantry,” he focuses only on the village of Lisarh, where the reprisals were especially lethal. This allows him to map out a precise timeline of the entire riot, as well as to catalog the many denials and excuses offered by local officials and activists. But because of this focus, he spotlights the actions of particular Jats and blurs together the broader experience of the victims, until both perpetrators and casualties grow abstract. I left the book uncertain about some key facts: the scale of the riots, how many villages they affected, whether they looked different in rural versus urban areas. In past books, Sacco made a point of emphasizing this kind of epistemic uncertainty, but in Riot he occasionally glosses over it—perhaps because too much remains unknown.

This might be an unavoidable shortcoming, but it can undermine what is best in his method, as well as the higher ideas he’s using the book to pursue. Victims emerge and disappear, without much time given over to individuating them. He does not probe their life stories, as he did with Omm Nafez and Khamis back in Gaza; he must race off to the next source. Like figures in a massive spread, they lose their particularity, and they form again as a collective, a swirling mass where no face can stand out.

Then again, what the cartoonist loses in detail he gains in scope. The Once and Future Riot is a new sort of book for Sacco, more philosophical than humanistic, its eye trained on larger social and political structures. Here, he’s concerned less with the aftereffects of political violence and more with the future it might engender. Such mass assaults, he believes, might become a common feature of Indian democracy, where politics is dominated by Hindu nationalists intent on making a populous and diverse country into a two-tiered polity fighting abstracted enemies. And there are uncomfortable analogues across the world, conflicts driven by demagogues who don’t care about the fuzziness of the truth or the fallibility of memory—only about power, and about weaponizing any cleavage or crack they can find. “A democracy that arouses violence,” he suggests, “may one day be overwhelmed by it.” After a career spent reporting on ethnic chauvinism, criminal impunity, and history’s endlessly reopened wounds, he has stepped back to take in the long view. The outlook isn’t bright.

If you buy a camera and put it on line and do not have a full time security guy to maintain it, I assure you it will be hacked.

It&#39;ll be harder for them to compromise SKor.  But seriously, given the hacker haven that North Korea is, you&#39;d think South Korea would be a lot more careful with computer security regulation.

No, the complete and utter destruction of humanity.

The sane solution is to not allow AI-enabled toys for your children. Even in case of being able to guarantee 100% benign responses and no hallucinations, an already unrealistic proposition, why would you encourage your children to form lasting bonds with an animate furry object. This is how you get adult furies. Get a puppy instead.Why kink shame, man?Possible furry issues aside, the real problem with the whole AI toy situation is that they are being used by the corporations making them as a gateway drug. Get the kids used to interacting with AI enabled devices, and they&#39;ll move on to bigger, more complex AI devices as they grow up. And since we seem to insist that all time belongs to the corporations, and both parents should absolutely be dedicating most of their day to the corporations that employ them rather than raising their kids

Here&#39;s your problem--someone set this thing to &quot;Evil&quot;!

We sell toy guns to children so they can grow up to be soldiers. Preferably blonde haired and blue eyed, and has a love of God and wants to kill communists.

On Sunday, father-and-son gunmen armed with shotguns killed 15 people and injured 40 more at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia. Their target was Chanukah by the Sea, an annual event run by the Chabad of Bondi. The dead include a Holocaust survivor, a rabbi, and a 10-year-old girl. It is the deadliest mass shooting to occur in Australia since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, a tragedy that reshaped the nation and led to the creation of gun laws that have, until now, prevented such violence from being a regular occurrence.

It is hard to parse this violence as a person from a country where it is abnormal. It is impossible not to personalize the grief, shock, and confusion. I was scrolling Instagram Stories on a sleepy Sunday arvo when I saw a friend post “just heard what I think are gunshots at Bondi - what’s going on?” The events unfolded so rapidly and brutally that it has shocked Australia into a whiplash of the soul that we will be grappling with for years to come.

We are in shock. This does not happen here. And yet, it has. It is difficult to reconcile that reality with who we are and who we imagine ourselves to be as a nation.

In the worst ways possible, the early response to the attack has taken on contours that would be familiar to Americans. That’s partly because authorities have said the shooters were motivated by “Islamic State ideology,” and because Israel’s genocide in Gaza—and the Australian complicity in it, mostly at the hands of Americans—has been a roiling issue here.

In the immediate aftermath of this attack, Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the tragedy on Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese of the Australian Labor Party, for recognizing an independent state of Palestine back in September. In his early career, Albanese was an ally of Palestine, co-founding the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine in 1999, but as prime minister he has tacitly supported Israel, Netanyahu, and the genocide in every material sense beyond a few empty gestures and hollow statements. This has divided Labor’s moderate base and beyond, and the government’s unwillingness to criticize Israel, let alone stop selling them arms, has been a major reason for the mass protests that have had hundreds of thousands of Australians marching through the streets of our major cities every weekend since Oct. 7, 2023.

Earlier this year, Albanese controversially appointed an “Antisemitism envoy” to appease Zionist interest groups. Jillian Segal, whose husband had donated to the Nazi-adjacent far-right group Advance Australia, used this position to put forth a highly censorious and constitutionally dubious list of proposed reforms framed as a “plan to combat antisemitism” that would all but outlaw criticism of Israel in Australia if adopted (which they weren’t, but likely will be in the wake of this weekend’s events). Segal has done little else in this perfunctory role other than push the narrative that the boom in antisemitism stems from the peaceful pro-Palestine movement—a falsehood she was quick to repeat in immediate response to the attacks. She has ignored the many neo-Nazi and white nationalist marches that have taken place in Australia this year, and many have concluded that she perceives more antisemitic hatred in a keffiyeh than a literal swastika.

Despite neither of the shooters being at all linked as of this writing with the pro-Palestine movement, Australia’s conservative politicians, its conservative media (which is most of it), and its right, far right, and alt right have all been quick to link the attack to the pro-Palestine crowd, particularly the campus protests, where some claim the shooter was “radicalized.” Which is odd, as the young shooter appears to be a brickie (Australian for bricklayer) who never attended university. In fact, the shooters have been found to have affiliations with the Islamic State, which is a known enemy of the Palestinian people, the pro-Palestine movement, Hamas, and Hezbollah.

Still, Australia’s right, like America’s, do not turn their nose up at an opportunity. They have had a rough time of it of late. Our conservative party, the Coalition (a combination of the Liberals and the Nationals), now headed by placeholder leader Sussan Ley, was annihilated in one of the most resounding electoral defeats in Australia’s history in May 2025. So disastrous is Ley, the Coalition’s polling, and the Coalition’s electoral prospects both on the state and federal level, that our major conservative party is essentially on the point of extinction.

Unable to find a weak spot in Albanese’s radically Zen centrism, the Coalition cynically exploited Sunday’s bloodbath almost immediately. Ley laid the blame at Albanese’s feet, and Josh Frydenberg, a major figure of the party’s hard right, demanded Albanese take “personal responsibility” for the attack. Former Prime Minister John Howard—imagine Ronald Reagan crossed with Dick Cheney crossed with Gollum, or imagine if Richard Nixon was your longest-serving president—emerged from his lair to point fingers at Albanese, his government, and Howard’s oldest, most loathed enemy, the amorphous “left.” (Howard looms over the Coalition like Darth Sidious, and as prime minister, he was the architect of Australia’s involvement in the illegal Iraq war.)

These are the mainstream of Australian conservatism and the Australian right. Behind them are a cavalcade of bloodthirsty grifters, knuckle-draggers, and hatemongers whose immediate response to the news was to lick their lips. They have been waiting for an event like this their entire lives. Pauline Hanson, founder and head of One Nation, a party that has been the fetishized mascot of white nationalism and paranoiac race hatred in Australia for 30 years, arrived with her newly anointed goon Barnaby Joyce to fire off a hateful screed before the freshly laid memorial flowers. She condemned the prime minister, Muslims, and antisemitism—somewhat of an irony, as she was recently the headline speaker at one of the many neo-Nazi marches that have recurred in Melbourne and Sydney this past year.

Other prominent bigots preferred the safety of the internet. “Western civilisation enjoyer” Drew Pavlou, a basement-dwelling influencer known best for taking a decade to complete an undergrad degree, immediately began livestreaming the shootings on his monetized YouTube channel. He took to X and began firing out dangerous misinformation, egging on racial violence with the rabid Islamophobia that has become his bread and butter. As people still lay dying, he falsely claimed that a preplanned Christmas firework event taking place in Sydney was in fact the city’s Muslim community taking to the streets in celebration. As I write, he is livestreaming himself at the public memorial, where his excitement at the prospect of inciting a race war is palpable.

I focus on Drew as a particularly grotesque case study of the breed of professional hate-peddlers that America is all too aware and fond of. The deluge of misinformation that promulgated in the immediate wake of the attacks was fueled by American social media platforms that have prioritized and monetized bigotry and psychosis. X, Meta, and YouTube were flooded with A.I. fakes, the most darkly comical of which was a reimagining of the great hero of the day, Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian Muslim fruit-shop owner who bravely wrestled a gun from one of the shooters, as a white man with a comfortably white name.

Australian racism is not too dissimilar from America’s—indeed, it is largely informed by it these days—but of course it is different by the very nature of our unique histories and cultures. Like America, Australia’s Islamophobia has been violent, demented, and frothing since 9/11, and, like America, our domestic and foreign policies have unfairly targeted Muslims and the Muslim world—Iraq, Palestine, Indonesia, and beyond. Our media, much of which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and other billionaires who sometimes outpace even him in their hatreds, regularly runs extremely Islamophobic content, occasionally resulting in real violence (such as the notorious Cronulla riots, which occurred nearly 20 years ago to the day of the Bondi shootings). This reached its nightmarish apex in the 2019 Christchurch shootings, where an Australian white nationalist terrorist flew to New Zealand and murdered 51 people at a mosque. This took place in New Zealand, but it was very much an Australian shooting.

Hatred breeds hatred, and the surge of antisemitism, neo-Nazi groups like the NSN, and white nationalists like Pauline Hanson and Drew Pavlou, exists within, and is inflamed by, the malformed hatreds that are tragically intrinsic to the Australian identity. Antisemitic attacks were on the rise far before this month, raising alarm. I cannot sum up 250 years of Australian history in this article—it is hard enough to contextualize the last week—but it is important for you to do that most un-American of things and recognize that these events do not take place in a void, but rather within the specific context of a long and complicated history.

But the right’s narrative may not win out in the end, especially with the deeply unpopular and off-putting American right weighing in loudly and regularly on their behalf, laying the blame on Australia’s infamously strict gun laws. It might sound alien to even moderate Americans, but the immediate consensus here after the shooting has been that our gun laws are not strict enough—an observation many experts have been making for years as private gun ownership has bloomed exponentially, especially in the past decade. Both our prime minister and the premier of New South Wales, Chris Minns—who was an ally of the pro-gun Shooters, Fishers, and Farmers Party—have vowed gun law reform. How a person like the alleged shooter who the ASIO (our FBI) had been tracking for ties to the Islamic State associations as early as 2019 was able to acquire a gun license, let alone six shotguns, will no doubt be the subject of a lengthy parliamentary inquiry in the months to come.

In truth, if Sunday holds any lessons for Americans, it’s that Australia’s gun laws, though flawed, work. How many would have been killed if the terrorists were able to buy a couple of AR-15s from their local Coles? How many mass shootings would we have had since Port Arthur if John Howard (yes, the same man I described above) had not brought in such strict and transformative gun laws in the immediate aftermath? All I know is this is the first mass shooting on Australian soil since 1995. America has had 468 this year.

Still, American discourse, and American policy, regularly leads us about by the nose. We are The Kid to your Judge Holden, and we will ride with you to our doom. Our role as loyal foot soldiers in every American war since Korea, but especially in Iraq, and again with our support of Israel (which is largely to placate the United States), has a hand here. Our insidiously growing gun culture and broken discourse and outpourings of online-hatred blueprints imported from America have again brought the violence home to us. We of all people should know the boomerang swings back, but we got too dependent on you to truly acknowledge that. As I write, Australia’s mainstream journalists—many of whom rank among the dumbest on Earth—are riling up great dramas and screeds in a tone and style that is distinctly American, which is to say, worrying.

And yet, it is useful to see these people as a loud minority.

A contradiction I’m sure you understand is that Australia is a country of many hatreds, but also a country of great love. That love for one another is what we aspire toward as Australians; those who act on this love are the greatest Australians there are. Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian refugee who confronted the shooter head-on, saving countless lives, is what we’d call the light on the hill—a kind of goodness and courage we, as Australians, must collectively strive for. Boris and Sofia Gurman, two Bondi locals who were killed in their attempts to stop one of the shooters, reflexively moved to save lives at the cost of their own. The community that has come forward to grieve and lay flowers, the swimmers who have insisted on keeping this beloved beach a place of mateship and joy, the imams and rabbis who hug and shake hands and hold each other in mourning, understanding, and support, the millions of “Are you OK?” “How are you feeling?” and “I’ll ride with you if you’re feeling unsafe” texts sent between friends, neighbors, and comrades, the record-breaking amount of blood donations given these past few days, and the rejection of violent hatred as abject, alien, and fundamentally un-Australian—this is what it has always meant, and will continue to mean, to be what we call “True Blue.” This is the Australia as it should and must be.

Last weekend brought an awful series of tragedies: a mass shooting at Brown University that left two promising young students dead; a mass shooting targeting Jews at a Hanukkah event in Australia that left 15 people dead; and the murder of Rob and Michele Reiner, allegedly by their troubled son.

But some American conservatives who weren’t directly affected by the violence have regardless found a way to frame themselves as the real victims amid all this tragedy—even if they have to invent facts to get there.

Donald Trump descended to new lows with his tweet about the Reiners’ deaths, writing:

A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.

This was a bizarre take—police have arrested the Reiners’ son Nick, who has struggled for years with drug addiction and homelessness, and he has been charged with killing the couple—and while many conservatives did criticize the president, others, including Fox News columnist David Marcus, defended him for saying “what a lot of people are really thinking but won’t say.” (Were a lot of people actually thinking: Rob Reiner was probably murdered because of his anti-Trump views?)

College Republicans founder and chairman William Branson Donahue wrote that Ella Cook, one of the Brown murder victims, “was allegedly targeted for her conservative beliefs, hunted, and killed in cold blood.” Elon Musk reposted a now-deleted tweet blaming the left for Cook’s murder. Conspiracy theorist and Trump whisperer Laura Loomer tweeted, “Jewish and Christian conservative students and faculty targeted at Brown University and they want you to think western civilization isn’t under attack.” New York City Council member Vickie Paladino, who has also called to expel Muslims from Western nations, claimed that it is “very clear now that the attack at Brown was perpetrated by a leftist activist and targeted Republicans.” Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York state tweeted about Cook’s killing, noting that “conservatives have been targeted again and again.” Other conservative influencers asserted that “the police explicitly claimed it was likely a targeted attack to [Cook’s] family and that when [the shooter] came in the room he looked specifically for her first before he fired”; they also stated, “Young men and women like Ella know they can be killed for their political beliefs on a college campus.”

Except the Brown shooter had not yet been apprehended, there was no word on his motive, and officials had not stated that Cook was singled out. He shot up not a College Republicans meeting but a voluntary economics study session. And he killed a second student, Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, and injured nine more. Despite wholly uncorroborated claims of “sources” and police statements, those spreading the rumor that Cook had been murdered for her politics have provided no actual evidence.

That didn’t stop Vice President J.D. Vance from highlighting Cook and Cook alone in his initial post about the Brown shooting, in which he also emphasized her political beliefs; it took him until the next day to recognize Umurzokov. He described Cook as “a beautiful young girl”; Umurzokov, he wrote, was “a brilliant young man.” (Cook was, in fact, a year ahead of Umurzokov.)

The claim that conservatives are the primary victims of political violence as opposed to the primary perpetrators of it has been invented and disseminated by powerful right-wing figures. And it is peak hypocrisy in about a dozen different directions. Conservatives have for years chastised liberals to not “politicize” gun deaths, only to use the shooting in Sydney to argue in favor of expelling Muslims from America. (Statistically, both guns and men are involved in many more shootings than Muslims are.)

After anti-cancel-culture hero Charlie Kirk was killed, conservatives not only claimed they were being systematically hunted down—they became the cancellation squad, demanded the firing of anyone who so much as quoted Kirk in a way that made him sound bad (something, it turns out, that isn’t hard to do). Even Vance joined the mob. Some 600 people, nearly all of them average Americans and not elected officials or people otherwise in power, were punished for their social media posts about Kirk. So far, there is no right-wing demand to penalize the president for his ugly comments about Reiner.

For decades, feminists have asserted that calling abortion providers baby killers and sharing their names, photos, and addresses was putting a target on their backs; conservatives disagreed, claiming that the many, many, many “pro-life” advocates who harassed women, set clinics on fire, stalked clinic staff, and shot doctors were simply hundreds upon hundreds of lone wolves. After Kirk was killed, conservatives began to argue that using terms like fascist or authoritarian was tantamount to inciting violence, and that Kirk’s death was not the result of one extremist making an evil choice but the fault of progressive groups and funders.

And for many years, as liberals have pointed out right-wing violence—including the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021—MAGA acolytes have mocked us, ignored us, or flat-out denied reality. Trump, after all, encouraged his followers to descend on Washington based on the lie that the election had been stolen from him, and it was that lie that fueled the Jan. 6 rioters’ rage. Trump then pardoned nearly all of them, including those who behaved violently—and several have gone on to commit other serious crimes. Now, without evidence, conservatives claim that they’re the real victims of political violence.

This right-wing victim mentality has been building for years. Trump twice careered into the White House on the fumes of largely white and largely male resentment, after telling his voters that, yes, they were oppressed and mistreated and stolen from and put upon, and their attackers were immigrants, liberals, feminists, the media, and the deep state. Now that he’s in office and grabbing unprecedented levels of power, his followers remain convinced of their own victimization, this time around by “leftists,” who they insist are attacking them and even threatening their lives. Left-wing violence is indeed a problem, as Kirk’s murder demonstrated—but in truth, right-wing violence remains significantly more common; 75 percent to 80 percent of people who have died at the hands of domestic terrorists in the U.S. since 2001 were killed by right-wing extremists.

Facts, as some conservatives like to say, don’t care about your feelings. But MAGA supporters are a deeply feeling bunch, and they definitely care about their feelings over the facts. Fear is a conservatizing force, and conservatives tend to be more fearful than liberals. I don’t doubt that conservatives genuinely fear violence being carried out against them, just as I don’t doubt that they genuinely fear immigrants the same way they genuinely fear new experiences. Studies have found that conservatives’ brains are more reactive to fear than liberals’ brains, which can cause them to overreact and let emotion override reality. The wealth of evidence demonstrating that it’s conservatives, not liberals, who are more prone to behaving violently for political ends can’t penetrate a strongly held belief based on a primordial panic.

Moving through life this way—fearful, angry, and convinced one is being perpetually victimized—is no doubt exhausting. It also explains the genius of Trump and his MAGA movement. While many Republicans before him espoused a kind of pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps rugged individualism, the president did away with all of that, simply telling his followers that they had been wronged and identifying familiar groups upon whom to heap blame. And, of course, Trump had been wronged worst of all (is still, perpetually, being wronged). No president in American history has portrayed himself as nearly as much of a victim as Trump, a man who holds unimaginable power in his hands but yet is never at fault, a person who has had every advantage in life but still speaks of himself as the most persecuted man in history. His followers make blasphemous imagery of him as Jesus: a perfect, abused man who would give his very life for their sins (of which, naturally, Trump has none).

One can see the appeal of the conservative victim mentality. Victims are innocent: Their dream jobs aren’t materializing because of immigrants, not because they dropped out of college. It’s liberals calling people fascists that fuels violence, not the Republican-enabled lack of gun laws that make the U.S. a radical outlier on both gun safety and gun deaths. It can feel safer, for a while, to not take responsibility for one’s own life. And feeling embattled can convince a person that they’re courageous, their cause noble, and their efforts to vanquish their enemies virtuous—even if, in reality, they’re simply a frightened hypocrite, terrorizing others so that they might feel less afraid.

            <h2>Snowflake update caused a blizzard of failures worldwide</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/snowflake_update_caused_a_blizzard/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake pushed an update this week that caused a “major outage” worldwide, leaving many users unable to query data, experiencing failures when ingesting files, and receiving error messages for 13 hours, the company wrote in an impact statement.

“Our initial investigation has identified that our most recent release introduced a backwards-incompatible database schema update,” the company wrote in its incident report. “As a result, previous release packages errantly referenced the updated fields, resulting in version mismatch errors and causing operations to fail or take an extended amount of time to complete.”

The update took down 10 of Snowflake’s 23 global regions. In the US, the outage hit chunks of Snowflake customers accessing its Azure data center in Virginia, and its AWS data center in Oregon. Globally, users of Snowflake’s data centers in Ireland, Zurich, London, Sweden, Mumbai, Singapore, and Mexico were hit.

The outage was first reported as an issue with Snowflake Data Cloud at 0255 UTC Tuesday when customer queries against their data returned SQL execution errors.

About an hour and a half later, Snowflake said that it had identified the problem and it was working on a fix. The systems were back up and running by about 0500 UTC.

“I dealt with this yesterday,” one user groused on Snowflake&#39;s Reddit page. “Took them way too long to role [sic] back this change”

The company said it would release its root cause analysis within five days of closing the incident, which should be Sunday.

“We have nothing additional to share at this time,” a spokesperson told The Register.

This was Snowflake’s second incident inside of a week after a Dec 10 database infrastructure issue caused degraded performance among users who employ its software out of the AWS datacenter in Oregon, according to its status page.

Snowflake is not the only data platform with issues this month.

Between Dec 11 and Dec 13, Snowflake’s archrival Databricks had a days-long service disruption where customers in several US regions experienced latency or errors when using Mosaic AI, the company’s assistant for building AI agents, which was contained to users of the company’s Azure data centers in seven US regions.

That came after customers in its US Gov West AWS region endured a “complete outage, with all Databrick services presumed unavailable” for about two hours on Dec 3.

Unlike Snowflake, which lists the preliminary cause of outages and follows up with a root cause analysts on its incident page, Databricks does not publish the cause of its outages.

Databricks did not respond to an email from The Register seeking comment. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Web browsers for desktop and mobile devices tend to receive regular security updates, but that often isn&#39;t the case for those that reside within game consoles, televisions, e-readers, cars, and other devices. These outdated, embedded browsers can leave you open to phishing and other security vulnerabilities.

Researchers affiliated with the DistriNet Research Unit of KU Leuven in Belgium have found that newly released devices may contain browsers that are several years out of date and include known security bugs.

In a research paper [PDF] presented at the USENIX Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) 2025 in August, computer scientists Gertjan Franken, Pieter Claeys, Tom Van Goethem, and Lieven Desmet describe how they created a crowdsourced browser evaluation framework called CheckEngine to overcome the challenge of assessing products with closed-source software and firmware.

The framework functions by providing willing study participants with a unique URL that they&#39;re asked to enter into the integrated browser in the device being evaluated. During the testing period between February 2024 and February 2025, the boffins received 76 entries representing 53 unique products and 68 unique software versions.

In 24 of the 35 smart TVs and all 5 e-readers submitted for the study, the embedded browsers were at least three years behind current versions available to users of desktop computers. And the situation is similar even for newly released products.

&quot;Our study shows that integrated browsers are updated far less frequently than their standalone counterparts,&quot; the authors state in their paper. &quot;Alarmingly, many products already embed outdated browsers at the time of release; in fact, eight products in our sample included a browser that was over three years obsolete when it hit the market.&quot;

According to KU Leuven, the study revealed that some device makers don&#39;t provide security updates for the browser, even though they advertise free updates.

The researchers cited several case studies that assessed the exploitability of devices with outdated browsers. The Boox Note Air 3 e-ink tablet, released in January 2024, for example, ships with the NeoBrowser, which is based on Chromium 85, released in August 2020.

&quot;Notably, across four software updates, the integrated browser remained unpatched,&quot; the researchers said, adding that the company lacked a security reporting channel and that support staff misrepresented the resolution of the problem. As a result, the authors reported the matter to the EU regulatory authorities.

In December 2024, the EU Cyber Resilience Act came into force, initiating a transition period through December 2027, when vendors will be fully obligated to tend to the security of their products. The KU Leuven researchers say that many of the devices tested are not yet compliant.

The authors also looked at gaming applications that include an embedded browser: Steam, Ubisoft Connect, and AMD Adrenalin.

The Steam enrollments submitted through the CheckEngine framework included two browsers based on Chromium 109, from January 2023, and one that used Chromium 126, from June 2024. The researchers said that while they could not reproduce any of the three known vulnerabilities tested, they found that they could spoof the origin of alert boxes in the older versions.

&quot;Here, by exploiting an open redirect – previously discovered for a Steam domain – an attacker could craft a URL that triggers an alert box appearing to originate from a legitimate domain, which is useful for phishing attacks,&quot; the researchers said.

Ubisoft Connect&#39;s embedded browser, based on Chromium 109, also didn&#39;t yield to known vulnerabilities due to a limitation that did not allow the opening of new tabs or windows, but the authors did find the browser came configured with the --no-sandbox flag, which raised the risk of privilege escalation attacks.

With AMD Adrenalin, the KU Leuven researchers reproduced the address bar spoofing vulnerability in its Chromium 112-based browser from April 2023. AMD, they said, acknowledged the issue and was working on a fix at the time they initially presented their findings.

The authors put some of the blame on development frameworks like Electron that bundle browsers with other components.

&quot;We suspect that, for some products, this issue stems from the user-facing embedded browser being integrated with other UI components, making updates challenging – especially when bundled in frameworks like Electron, where updating the browser requires updating the entire framework,&quot; they said in their paper. &quot;This can break dependencies and increase development costs.&quot;

But in other cases, they suggest the issue arises from inattention on the part of vendors or a choice not to implement essential security measures.

While they suggest mechanisms like product labels may focus consumer and vendor attention on updating embedded browsers, they conclude that broad voluntary compliance is unlikely and that regulations should compel vendors to take responsibility for the security of the browsers they embed in their products. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Your AWS account could be quietly running someone else&#39;s cryptominer. Cryptocurrency thieves are using stolen Amazon account credentials to mine for coins at the expense of AWS customers, abusing their Elastic Container Service (ECS) and their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) resources, in an ongoing operation that started on November 2.

The illicit cryptocurrency-mining campaign abuses compromised valid AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials with &quot;admin-like privileges&quot; - it doesn&#39;t exploit a vulnerability - and then uses this access to deploy a SBRMiner-MULTI on ECS and EC2, Amazon security engineer Kyle Koeller said in a blog this week.

&quot;Within 10 minutes of the threat actor gaining initial access, crypto miners were operational,&quot; Koeller wrote.

Amazon&#39;s GuardDuty threat detection service spotted the cryptomining operation in a handful of customer accounts and alerted customers, we&#39;re told.

After the crooks obtained the compromised AWS credentials, they checked EC2 service quotas to see how many instances they could launch, and tested their credential permissions by calling the RunInstances API multiple times with the DryRun flag enabled. This allowed them to ensure the credentials had sufficient privileges to proceed with their illicit mining, while not yet incurring compute charges and risking detection.

They also created &quot;dozens&quot; of ECS clusters to enable their illegal activities, sometimes exceeding 50 in a single attack, and used auto scaling groups in EC2 to maximize service quotas and resource consumption.

To make disruption more difficult - and thus allow the criminals to collect more cryptocurrency from stolen resources - they used ModifyInstanceAttribute with disable API termination set to true for persistence. This blocks the termination of AWS instances used for mining, and forces victims to take an extra step and re-enable API termination before deleting the impacted resources.

&quot;The threat actor&#39;s scripted use of multiple compute services, in combination with emerging persistence techniques, represents an advancement in crypto mining persistence methodologies that security teams should be aware of,&quot; Koeller wrote.

After deploying miners, the miscreants created an AWS Lambda function configured with no authentication and exposed it via a public Lambda Function URL, allowing them to maintain persistent access to the victims’ environments.

To prevent becoming a victim of cryptomining abuse, Amazon recommends strong identity and access management controls, as well as temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys. As always, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, and apply least privilege to IAM. ®

Folding phones come with great responsibilities and great rewards.

A foldable phone isn’t for the faint of heart. They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. They’re also still not as durable as regular smartphones, though they’re not nearly as fragile as they once were. In fact, thanks to Google, we finally have a foldable phone we can take with us to the beach.

There are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.

Most phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.

Most modern foldables carry an IP48 rating, meaning they’re built to withstand full water immersion and solid particles 1mm or bigger. Devices with an IP48 rating aren’t fully protected from dust, which remains a concern when it comes to long-term durability. However, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold carries an IP68 rating, making it the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance.

In addition to the best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.

So while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.

If I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.

Full dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnets

Heavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather resistance: IP68

Durability has long been the North Star of the foldable category, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold marks a real milestone in that journey. With an IP68 rating, it’s the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance. That means you can take the $1,799 device on a hike or to the beach without worrying that a stray grain of sand will absolutely destroy it. Add in Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging — along with Google’s more powerful Tensor G5 chip — and you have the most well-rounded foldable available.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn’t without its shortcomings, though. It offers all-day battery life with minimal use of the inner display; however, if you spend most of your time using the inner screen, your battery will likely be in the red by bedtime. Also, while we love the device’s improved durability, its cameras fall short of Google’s other 10 Pro models, especially in low light. The foldable is a bit heavier and thicker than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, too, which is a fair trade for greater peace of mind.

Samsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable camera

More susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The latest Galaxy Z Flip may not be as fun as the newest Razr Ultra, but it does offer a few new tricks. Samsung ditched the old file-folder cover screen in favor of a glorious, 4.1-inch edge-to-edge panel that wraps around the cameras. The extra real estate means you have more room to quickly respond to messages or perform any task that doesn’t require you to open your phone (and risk getting lost in a digital rabbit hole).

In addition to the larger cover screen, the Flip 7 offers a couple of other thoughtful updates. It’s thinner than its predecessor and features a bigger 4,300mAh battery, which is a step up from the 4,000mAh battery found in the last-gen Flip 6. The camera system remains unchanged from last year’s model, too, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The 50-megapixel main shooter still produces great images, and you get all the versatility the flip form factor has to offer, including the ability to easily take selfies using the rear camera.

Despite some welcome changes, the Flip 7 carries the same IP48 rating as last year’s model, which means long-term durability against fine dust particles remains a concern. However, Samsung offers a great warranty and repair program, along with seven years of OS and security updates. The Flip 7 isn’t perfect, but it’s the most powerful and polished version yet — just don’t drop it while lounging on the beach.

One of the best-looking phones you can buyGreat battery lifeOuter screen is useful in unexpected ways

AI button is wasted real estate Long-term durability is still a question markCamera processing is occasionally weird

Screen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.

Beyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing. Meanwhile, Motorola is only promising three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which is on the shorter side considering the $1,300 retail price.

It’s really, really thinExcellent battery lifeThe crease is almost invisible

Foldables are still fragileIt’s not launching in the US or Europe

Screen: 8.12-inch, 2248p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.62-inch, 1140p, 120Hz OLED outer screen size/ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 8-megapixel selfie cameras (inner and outer) / Battery: 5,600mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IPX8/IPX9

Let’s get the bad news out of the way first: if you live in the US or Europe, you can’t buy the Oppo Find N5. That rules out, well, a lot of us. But if you live in China, Singapore, or any of the other Asian countries Oppo included in its so-called “global” release, then you’re in luck: you can pick up one of the world’s thinnest book-style folding phones, and the rest of us are all very jealous of you.

The Find N5 isn’t all about thinness, either. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is highly capable, the phone is fully water-resistant, and battery life is excellent. It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology to accommodate a large (by foldable standards) 5,600mAh battery, which easily holds up after a long day of heavy use. What’s even more impressive is that, like the aforementioned Z Fold 7, the Find N5 is still barely thicker than a standard slab-style phone and only slightly heavier. That matters when you’re using the phone via the cover screen for long periods of time or stashing it in the side pocket of your yoga pants. When a foldable is only about as heavy and bulky as a regular phone, using the inner screen feels like getting away with something fantastic — not a benefit you have to make many other sacrifices for. Oppo delivers this in spades, and I just wish more of us could… find it.

After months of teasing, Samsung has finally announced the Z TriFold, which the company is planning to launch during the first quarter of 2026 here in the US. The device takes the foldable concept a step further with not one, but two hinges, which open to reveal an inner screen that measures 10 inches diagonally. The outer display, meanwhile, is 6.5 inches and features a normal 21:9 aspect ratio, similar to what you’d find in a standard smartphone. The device also features a ceramic-glass, fiber-reinforced polymer back panel that’s designed to resist cracking, plus an IP48 rating, meaning it’s fully water-resistant but not dust-tight.

Update, December 18th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added info about the Z TriFold to the “What’s coming next” section. Brandon Russell also contributed to this post.

The TV-maker will ‘take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish.’

LG says it will let users delete the Microsoft Copilot shortcut it installed on newer TVs after several reports highlighted the unremovable icon. In a statement to The Verge, LG spokesperson Chris De Maria says the company “respects consumer choice and will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish.”

Last week, a user on the r/mildlyinfuriating subreddit posted an image of the Microsoft Copilot icon in their lineup of apps on an LG TV, with no option to delete it. “My LG TV’s new software update installed Microsoft Copilot, which cannot be deleted,” the post says. The post garnered more than 36,000 upvotes as people grow more frustrated with AI popping up just about everywhere.

Both LG and Samsung announced plans to add Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant to their TVs in January, but it appears to be popping up on LG TVs following a recent update to webOS.

De Maria adds that the icon is a “shortcut” to the Microsoft Copilot web app that opens in the TV’s web browser, rather than “an application-based service embedded in the TV.” He also adds that “features such as microphone input are activated only with the customer’s explicit consent.”

Asked when LG will start letting users delete the Copilot icon, De Maria said there’s no “definitive timing” yet.

Following recent coverage regarding the arrival of Microsoft Copilot on LG TVs, we’re reaching out to provide an important clarification. Based on recent coverage regarding the arrival of Microsoft Copilot on LG TVs, we want to clarify that Microsoft Copilot is provided as a shortcut icon to enhance customer accessibility and convenience. It is not an application-based service embedded in the TV. When users select the Copilot shortcut, Microsoft’s website opens through the TV’s web browser, and features such as microphone input are activated only with the customer’s explicit consent.

Update, December 18th: Added more information from LG.

            <div id="article-text">And only if they were made with Google AI.

And only if they were made with Google AI.

Google expanded Gemini’s AI verification feature to videos made or edited with the company’s own AI models. Users can now ask Gemini to determine if an uploaded video is AI-generated by asking, “Was this generated using Google AI?”

Gemini will scan the video’s visuals and audio for Google’s proprietary watermark called SynthID. The response will be more than a yes or no, Google says. Gemini will point out specific times when the watermark appears in the video or audio. The company rolled out this capability for images in November, also limited to images made or edited with Google AI.

Some watermarks can be easily scrubbed, as OpenAI learned when it launched its Sora app full of exclusively AI-generated videos. Google calls its own watermark “imperceptible.” Still, we don’t yet know how easy it will be to remove, or how readily other platforms will detect the SynthID information and tag the content as AI-generated. Google’s Nano Banano AI image generation model within the Gemini embeds C2PA metadata, but the general lack of coordinated tagging of AI-generated material across social media platforms allows deepfakes to go undetected.

Gemini can handle videos up to 100 MB and 90 seconds for verification. The feature is available in every language and location that the Gemini app is available.

But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.Regrets—2025 had a few.

Each time you’ve heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it.For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. Throughout, Altman’s words have set the agenda. What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we’re on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he’s ever said about the technology. His own words trace how we arrived here. Read the full story.—James O’Donnell

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here.

Can AI really help us discover new materials?

One of my favorite stories in the Hype Correction package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? And what would that look like? Read the full story.

But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption.

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.

This year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.

We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.

That was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.

On reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”

Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.

Imagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.

That was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.

But as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.

Still interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.

It’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.

This year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.

But it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.

In April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”

Don’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”

When you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.

That’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.

To be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Colossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”

In a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.

Save the world, and this is the thanks you get?

During the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines—and the new technology delivered in record time.

But now that America’s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.

In August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.

The purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.

In August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

Wikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.

Only around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.

Perhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.

In September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”

There’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.

Nope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.

With unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.

Donald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.

This was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.

The White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it&#39;s absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.More: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)

In 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.

Critics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.

Apple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

Unveiled by the buzzy startup Deep, Vanguard will let teams of scientists live and work on the seabed for a week at a time.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.
